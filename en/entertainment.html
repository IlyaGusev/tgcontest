    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King’s Carole Baskin tricked into giving first interview by pranksters posing as Jimmy Fallon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TIGER King's Carole Baskin's first interview since the popular show came out on Netflix in March premiered Sunday.
The big cat activist thought she was exclusively talking to Jimmy Fallon when she was really talking to two YouTube pranksters.
Josh Pieters and Archie Manners wanted to see if they could trick celebrities into giving them interviews.
They do this by telling victims that they would be talking to a late-night show host, like James Corden or Jimmy Fallon.
From this they were able to score an exclusive chat with Baskin by pretending to be Jimmy Fallon.
In the fake interview, Carole revealed she “had to let go about half of our staff” because her sanctuary’s been closed amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Though she said she and handful of volunteers are working “double-time” to care for the haven’s 55 exotic cats, she confessed she doesn’t know if they’ll “ever going to be able to do tours again.”
Carole, who told Us Weekly she “isn’t angry” about the “fun prank,” was also persuaded to wear her flower crown while showing pictures of herself and her third husband, Howard Baskin.
She told the outlet: “I was suspicious as we were doing it because the questions appeared taped, but had no idea it would turn out to be such a fun prank.
“It gave us a very welcome good laugh. I appreciate their cleverness and that they created their video in a way that I don’t feel was in any way mean-spirited.”
She used the interview with the YouTubers as an opportunity to talk about a proposed law aimed at stopping the exploitation and abuse of big cats in zoos.
Josh talked to INSIDER about why he chose Carole and how he was able to get her to agree to a fake interview.
He explained: "Here's a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show.
"And we thought, why don't we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?"
He then explained that they used a fake email address to reach Carole and tell her they were producing live segments for The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.
Ultimately, she agreed to the interview.
They then went through thousands of Jimmy Fallon clips where he uses the word "cat" and pieced them all together to make Carole believe she was actually talking to the late-night show host.
Josh explained: "As you'll see in the video, Jimmy Fallon has interviewed people named Cat, he's interviewed the cast of 'Cats,' and he's actually interviewed a real cat.
"So we had quite a lot of options for using the word cat. We tried our best to make it work with that."
Of course, the way the two YouTubers landed the interview may seem a little shady and may have people wondering whether it's illegal or not.
The 26-year-old had previously explained their methodology in another interview: "I think we always we always try to, not only from a creative point of view, but also from a slightly moral point of view, not completely dupe someone by breaking the law or doing something really wrong," Pieters said in a previous interview.
"We always try to give people a bit of a chance."
The interviewer admitted that they weren't really expecting it to work.
He said: "Like all of our ideas, we really didn't expect it to work, and then it did work," he said. "I guess it's that trying to run an experiment and see if it works with not much hope of it working," he said. "And then when it does work, it's always quite fun to watch."
Baskin is a "very interesting lady," Pieters said, and is excited to share the interview with the world.
"We really did not expect it to work," he said. "We still can't really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin."
As most people know, Carole is one of the main characters in the docuseries Tiger King.
She was Joe Exotic's enemy and spent years trying to shut down his zoo and cub petting operation.
It was the Tiger King himself who first alleged that Carole murdered her first husband, Don Lewis.
Carole, never officially a suspect, has vehemently protested her innocence over “lies and innuendos” in the Netflix series.
The animal activist simply claimed that he had disappeared and made for dead, but new evidence shows he was actually murdered.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers Trick Carole Baskin Into Thinking She Was Being Interviewed For ‘The Tonight Show’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When Netflix’s Tiger King blew up in March, the show’s stars scrambled to give interviews with anyone who’d listen. All except Carole Baskin.
Now she’s given her first public interview since the docuseries aired, and it was all because two YouTubers pranked her into thinking they were producers for The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon.
Josh Pieters and Archie Manners came up with a plan to download clips from actual Jimmy Fallon interviews and put them into a soundboard on their iPad. They then reached out for a chat.
“She said no, because the Tiger Queen hates Tiger King for making suggestions she was involved in her husband’s disappearance,” Pieters said.
“So we emailed her again saying we wouldn’t talk about Tiger King, which was fine for us because we couldn’t make Jimmy Fallon talk about Tiger King.
“We said we’d just talk about cats.”
It turns out Fallon has interviewed Kat Dennings, the stars of the movie Cats, and Bob Irwin holding a cat, all of which were very useful as soundbite fodder.
While there was nothing groundbreaking in the interview, we did learn a few tidbits about how Big Cat Rescue is coping during the pandemic.
“We have so many cats depending on us, we don’t have a choice in the situation,” Baskin said.
She said they’ve stockpiled around 9,000 kilos of frozen meat and still have volunteers on hand to look after the animals every day.
“After COVID-19 I just don’t know if we’re ever going to be able to do tours again,” she added.
The fact this stunt was pulled off so smoothly shouldn’t come as a surprise – these are the same guys who literally flew professional racist Katie Hopkins to Prague as part of an elaborate prank to get her to pose in front of a sign reading C. U. N. T.
The boys have form.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers trick Carole Baskin into first interview since Tiger King</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTubers Josh Pieters and Archie Manners tricked Carole Baskin into giving her first interview since Tiger King after they convinced her that she was talking to Jimmy Fallon.
The pair reassured her that they would not talk about Netflix or Tiger King and she joked that she didn't want to be referred to as 'that b**** Carole Baskin'.
They tell her that she won't see the host as she speaks into the webcam while she even breaks out her signature "hey all you cool cats and kittens" phrase.
They used a soundboard with generic questions and quotes from Fallon.
Viewers were amazed that the pair managed to pull it off, as Baskin has shunned all media and interviews since the hit docuseries dropped on Netflix.
She was unhappy with how she was portrayed and the episode which focused on the disappearance of her ex-husband Don Lewis.
Baskin realised what had happened afterwards.
Commenting on the video, she wrote: "This is the email I sent to my husband and daughter after the interview: 'Well that was weird. I couldn't see Fallon during the interview, and when they had his voice on the questions they didn't sound like it was specific to the topic.
"'He'd just say things they could have recorded from any other interview; like - what are you doing during Quarantine?
"'At the end he said: 'Miss you buddy,' so that really didn't sound like it was live from him to me.
"'They did stick to the questions they gave us, so I just can't tell. This whole thing may have been a spoof and they said they won't broadcast till next week, and will let us know before they do, but I'm not holding my breath.'"

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Tiger King's' Carole Baskin Tricked Into Fake 'Tonight Show' Interview by YouTubers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin, who was featured in Netflix's popular Tiger King docu-series, has given few interviews since the show became a hit, citing her displeasure with the way the show portrayed her.  But she recently fell victim to a prank by YouTubers pretending to be Jimmy Fallon interviewing her for The Tonight Show.
Pranksters Josh Pieters and Archie Manners posted a video Sunday on their YouTube channel showing how they pranked Baskin. The duo pulled clips of Fallon asking various questions about cats that would not cause suspicion on Baskin's part.
"Here's a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show. And we thought, why don't we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?" Pieters told Insider, adding it took multiple attempts to finally get Baskin on board.
Baskin has previously said she doesn't like how Tiger King implied that she had a hand in her late husband's death. However, Pieters and Manners convinced her that "Jimmy Fallon" would ask only about her big cats.
They told her she wouldn't be able to see Fallon during the interview, being conducted via Zoom, and explained how they handled moments where they were stuck without an appropriate audio clip of Fallon's voice.
"There is often a moment where there isn't a clip that's suitable," Pieters told Insider. "But that's luckily where I have Archie on standby who can come in and act as the producer and say, 'Oh we've got a quick change there, Jimmy's just doing this,' or 'Jimmy's just doing his makeup,' and then it sort of explains why something sort of went wrong."
During the interview, Baskin talked about how she's been taking care of her animals amid the coronavirus pandemic, noting she'd had to lay off half her staff "due to the loss of tourism revenue" and that volunteers are still helping take care of the cats, and also asked viewers to support the Big Cat Public Safety Act, one of her most passionate causes, which she also spoke about  in the Netflix show. She also sent them several never-before-seen images.
On Sunday, Baskin toldUs Weekly that she wasn't upset by the prank and thought something was amiss during the interview.
"I was suspicious as we were doing it because the questions appeared taped. But had no idea it would turn out to be such a fun prank. It gave us a very welcome good laugh. I appreciate their cleverness and that they created their video in a way that I don’t feel was in any way mean-spirited," she said.
Pieters and Manners previously pranked British pop star Craig David, TikToker Holly H, Love Island couple Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury and magician Julius Dein by using voice clips from James Corden.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Carole Baskin Tricked Into Giving First Major TV Interview Since ‘Tiger King,’ Says ‘I Was Suspicious’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Kristine Lofgren
Carole Baskin gave her first major interview since the Netflix series “Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness” hit televisions across the country. While the big cat advocate thought she was speaking with Jimmy Fallon, it turned out that she was actually chatting with two YouTubers who tricked her into spilling details about her experience filming the show.
As Business Insider reports, Josh Pieters and Archie Manners reached out to Baskin to see if they could trick her into appearing in their video. Pieters conducted the interview, while Manners acted as a producer. They played clips of old television episodes of Jimmy Fallon’s show, The Tonight Show.
With so many interviews taking place remotely because of the coronavirus pandemic, the two saw an opportunity to trick celebrities into conducting interviews.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters said. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
To their surprise, Baskins agreed. They compiled a bunch of clips of Fallon talking about cats in order to prepare for their interview.
Baskin opened up about the challenges they’ve been facing at her big cat rescue in Citrus Park, Florida. She told them that she has been forced to lay off half her staff since they can no longer allow people to visit the park. She also talked about her choice of headwear – a type of lei – and urged people not to pay to see tiger cubs.
Since the news of the fake interview hit the media outlets, Baskins opened up about being tricked into giving an interview.
“I was suspicious as we were doing it because the questions appeared taped. But had no idea it would turn out to be such a fun prank. It gave us a very welcome good laugh. I appreciate their cleverness and that they created their video in a way that I don’t feel was in any way mean-spirited,” she told Us Weekly magazine.
In the past, Baskins has said that she was upset with the way she was portrayed on the show, which spent an entire episode focused on the disappearance of her husband. She says that people who are focused on finding out what happened to her late husband missed the point.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers claim they tricked 'Tiger King' star Carole Baskin into first public interview since show's release</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two YouTubers have claimed they've tricked Carole Baskin, a star of Netflix's "Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness," into her first public interview since the show's release.
The pair of Internet personalities -- Archie Manners and Josh Pieters -- shared a video online, detailing how they managed to score interviews with Baskin and several other celebrities by posing as staffers from various popular late-night talk shows, such as "The Tonight Show."
'TIGER KING': CAROLE, HOWARD BASKIN SAY THEY FEEL 'BETRAYAL' FROM FILMMAKERS, ARE GETTING DEATH THREATS
The duo's video explained that they'd use audio clips from popular hosts such as Jimmy Fallon to trick stars into believing they were speaking with the famous comedians via audio.
In their video, Manners and Pieters revealed that they posed as producers of Fallon's show when they asked to interview the big-cat enthusiast.
[WARNING: The video below contains graphic language.]
Baskin initially turned down the request, Manners and Pieters said, but eventually accepted after they promised not to speak about "Tiger King," which they explained "was fine with us because we couldn't make Jimmy Fallon talk about 'Tiger King.'"
Manners and Pieters explained that they used clips of Fallon's interviews mentioning the word "cat," including interviews with Kat Dennings and cast members of the musical movie "Cats."
Baskin spoke with the duo over Zoom, and they explained to her that while she cannot see Fallon, he could hear her, she would hear him and he would be asking her questions.

The interview then began as the duo played an audio clip of Fallon greeting a guest.
"I'm doing great," Baskin said. "My daughter, Jamie, suggested that I do this interview with you, so she says 'Hi,' and we are working every day with the cats at the sanctuary."
The YouTubers played more clips of Fallon's voice, asking her who was quarantining with her, and what she's been doing.
"Unfortunately, due to the loss of tourism revenue, we had to let go about half of our staff, and thankfully, all of our animal care is done by volunteers," Baskin said. "So, the animals are still getting their daily care, but it means all of us are having to work double-time to make sure that all that happens."
Baskin further discussed life in quarantine while running the sanctuary.
"Thankfully, we were able to fill up our freezers, we can store about 20,000 pounds of food at a time," she said.
Baskin later added: "After COVID-19, I just don't know if we're ever going to be able to do tours again."

The YouTubers then convinced Baskin to don a flower crown and introduce several video clips while saying her catchphrase: "Hey all you cool cats and kittens, it's Carole at Big Cat Rescue."
The video contained a montage of pictures that Manners and Pieters claimed the public hadn't seen.
Fallon recently has been asking each of his guests if they'd like to spotlight a charity or cause during their remote appearances on his show, so the Internet personalities replayed a clip of the late-night host asking Baskin to do the same.
"There is something you can do to end the abuse of big cats and to save them in the wild," the activist said. "That's to make the 'call of the wild,' and you can do that by testing the words 'cats,' C-A-T-S, to the number 5-2-8-8-6."
Baskin continued, explaining that such a text message would alert a member of Congress and serve as support for the Big Cat Public Safety Act, a bill she's supported.
They then concluded the interview with a clip of Fallon thanking a guest for joining him.
"Tiger King" followed the rivalry between Baskin and fellow big cat enthusiast Joseph Maldonado-Passage -- better known as Joe Exotic -- and also examined rumors that Baskin was involved in the disappearance of her ex-husband.

Baskin and her husband, Howard, did previously speak to the Tampa Bay Times following the release of the series.
Reps for Baskin did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTubers tricked Carole Baskin into giving her first major interview since 'Tiger King' by pretending to be Jimmy Fallon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin has given her first official interview since the binge-watching phenomenon “Tiger King” dropped on Netflix in March, and got everyone wondering whether she really did murder her husband and feed him to the big cats at her sanctuary.
But while she thought she was going to be chatting with late night host Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show,” she was actually being asked questions by Josh Pieters from his home in London, in his underwear, while his YouTube partner Archie Manners chaperoned the interview.
Pieters has been posting a three-part series since Friday on his YouTube channel, which has just changed its name to “Josh Pieters and Archie Manners.”
They wanted to know whether they could trick celebrities into thinking they were being interviewed on real late night TV shows by just using a Zoom call, some sound bites from old clips, and Manners pretending to be a producer.
Spoiler alert: they could.
When watching shows like “Good Morning Britain,” Pieters and Manners wondered whether the guests could always see who was interviewing them, Pieters told Insider in an exclusive interview.
“From there came the idea of just playing the talent recordings of their interviewers and seeing if they would notice,” Pieters said.
In the first two episodes, they spoke to UK pop star Craig David, TikToker Holly H,“Love Island” couple Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury, and magician Julius Dein with voice clips from James Corden. But they stepped things up a gear with the third video, which will air on Sunday night.
“Here’s a chance where we could perhaps interview some high level talent because we are going under the guise of being a really famous show,” Pieters told Insider. “And we thought, why don’t we take a shot in the dark and go for the most exclusive, hard to reach person in the world, with absolutely no hope of it working?”
They sent Carole Baskin an email from their trusty fake-but-also-real production company Invisible Objects, saying they were producing the live segments for “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.”
They’d almost forgotten about it when she finally replied and agreed to the call.
Pieters and Manners are a duo who have become well known and respected on YouTube for their social experiments. So far they have fooled the world with an Ed Sheeran lookalike, presented right-wing provocateur Katie Hopkins with a fake award, and sold microwave meals on Deliveroo, which earned them a reputation of having one of the “most underrated channels” on YouTube.
Even by their standards, faking the presence of James Corden and Jimmy Fallon sounds nearly impossible. The strange times we are living through certainly helped.
“I wouldn’t say it’s thanks to lockdown,” Pieters said. “It was just really interesting seeing people like Prince William and all these people you’d never imagined to see on Zoom, and Zoom becoming such a big thing.”
Video calls are being used by talk shows all over the world right now, and there’s no real set way to do them. So as long as Manners put on a confident enough performance, there’s no reason to doubt Fallon or Corden were listening in too.
“I think it’s also very hard when you are live on an interview with who you think is James Corden or Jimmy Fallon, to go, ‘Hold on a second, that’s not Jimmy Fallon,’ when it sounds like him,” Pieters told Insider.
“You’d have to be pretty sure of yourself and pretty brave to stop the interview.”
The interviews all went more smoothly than expected. Pieters said he’d been having nightmares of being really stuck and having nothing to say with the few clips in front of him, because it’s so hard imagining the direction the interview will go beforehand.
“There is often a moment where there isn’t a clip that’s suitable,” he said. “But that’s luckily where I have Archie on standby who can come in and act as the producer and say, ‘Oh we’ve got a quick change there, Jimmy’s just doing this,’ or ‘Jimmy’s just doing his makeup,’ and then it sort of explains why something sort of went wrong.”
The way they prepared for Baskin’s interview was by scouring Fallon’s older videos for relevant sound bites.
“As you’ll see in the video, Jimmy Fallon has interviewed people named Cat, he’s interviewed the cast of ‘Cats,’ and he’s actually interviewed a real cat,” Pieters said.
“So we had quite a lot of options for using the word cat. We tried our best to make it work with that.”
The end result was the first major interview Baskin has given since “Tiger King” aired.
“I think she did an interview for a local paper in Tampa where she’s from,” Pieters said. “But this was her first worldwide exclusive interview, which is just quite something.”
Pieters and Manners try to answer the “questions you didn’t know you had.”
They never try to completely trick anyone, because ultimately, lying and deceiving is a lot less interesting than what they actually pull off.
“I think we always we always try to, not only from a creative point of view, but also from a slightly moral point of view, not completely dupe someone by breaking the law or doing something really wrong,” Pieters said in a previous interview.
“We always try to give people a bit of a chance.”
Pieters said their latest series was simply seeing whether playing recordings to someone could convincingly pose as a real interview.
“Like all of our ideas, we really didn’t expect it to work, and then it did work,” he said. “I guess it’s that trying to run an experiment and see if it works with not much hope of it working,” he said. “And then when it does work, it’s always quite fun to watch.”
Baskin is a “very interesting lady,” Pieters said, and is excited to share the interview with the world.
“We really did not expect it to work,” he said. “We still can’t really believe we managed to interview Carole Baskin.”
The video will go live at around 3 p.m. ET.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Carole Baskin thought she was talking to Jimmy Fallon on Zoom. She was pranked.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Carole Baskin has been mostly quiet since the world became obsessed with Netflix's documentary series Tiger King. Now, the documentary subject has given the world a rare peek into her life in coronavirus quarantine, but she was tricked into doing so.
The Big Cat Rescue founder joined a Zoom call believing she was being interviewed by Jimmy Fallon to promote her animal sanctuary. Instead, she was talking to two YouTubers who had tricked her into thinking she was speaking with Fallon by posing as a casting company and playing sound bites of Fallon's voice. The YouTubers had clipped Fallon's soundbites from other videos. Fallon's continued to do The Tonight Show from home during quarantine, interviewing celebrities over video chat.
Josh Pieters and Archie Manners are the self-styled pranksters behind the fake Tonight Show interview. They've tricked other minor celebrities before by posing as talkshow bookers. But the Baskin interview is notable since she has been so private since Tiger King debuted. 
Baskin, whose shown as the nemesis of Tiger King's main subject, Joe Exotic, has criticized the show for her portrayal. The former zoo owner and tiger breeder is currently serving a prison term for hiring a hitman to kill Baskin. Baskin may run an animal sanctuary, but the documentary doesn't paint her as a saint. It airs concerns about her animal habitats and chronicles her ex-husband's disappearance in 1997. Local police never accused Baskin of wrongdoing, but her ex's family and friends suggest foul play (and that she fed him to her tigers). She denies it all.
Baskin tells the fake "casting company" she's doing the interview "for the cats," and uses it to promote the Big Cat Public Safety Act, potential legislation intended to stop the breeding of big cats in captivity. She only agreed to the interview if Tiger King and the ensuing controversy wouldn't be mentioned. She said her daughter her convinced her to talk to Fallon.
No one was physically hurt by this prank, but it's likely a blow to Baskin's ego. It's tempting to look at pranking for clicks as harmless, if groan-worthy. However, a hunger for YouTube views has put people in harm's way as YouTubers have undertaken more and more risky and morally questionable "pranks" to make videos all in the name of virality. 
Check out the video to see what Baskin and her cool cats and kittens have been up to in quarantine.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Oddjob’s lethal bowler hat from Goldfinger valued at £30,000</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A battered bowler hat from the James Bond film Goldfinger has been valued at up to £30,000 on the Antiques Roadshow. The steel-rimmed hat and weapon belonged to hitman Oddjob, played by Harold Sakata, in the 1964 film.
The owner said he was a big 007 fan as a child and his brother-in-law, who was a driver for Aston Martin during the filming of Goldfinger, asked Pinewood Studios if they had any memorabilia. The studio gave him Oddjob’s bowler hat but removed the metal rim.
“As a young lad, everybody wanted to throw the Oddjob hat, and if you look at it, everybody did throw the hat because it’s absolutely in pieces because it didn’t have the steel in it anymore, so therefore whenever it landed it damaged it,” the owner said.
It was previously revealed that the hat appears on the BBC One show, leaving Antiques Roadshow expert Marc Allum “shaking with anticipation and excitement”.
The Bond item was part of a collection of 007 memorabilia brought to Antiques Roadshow when it filmed at the National Botanic Garden of Wales last summer.

A signed clapperboard for the new James Bond film went under the hammer in April.
The piece of No Time To Die memorabilia – which was signed by stars including Daniel Craig, Naomie Harris, Lea Seydoux, Lashana Lynch and Ana De Armas – raised £13,000 for the NHS.
The item was one of 61 lots sold by the Bonhams auction house in aid of the NHS Charities Covid-19 Urgent Appeal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Comedy is dominating among movie and TV viewers as people look for laughs while social distancing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At-home audiences are looking for a good laugh as people practice social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. 
The talent agency UTA's data group UTA IQ, along with the research firm SightX, conducted a representative survey of nearly 1,100 people across the US, ages 18 to 54, who had been social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak from April 4 to April 11.
The survey found that 51% of respondents were watching comedy TV shows during the outbreak, the leading genre.
Drama (39%), action/adventure (33%), and news (33%) followed among TV viewers. Family came in at 27%.
"A third of people still rely on TV to get their news, and family-friendly content is important with so many children home 24/7," the survey said. 
The popularity of family television is good for Disney Plus, which was the streaming service with the highest level of "intent to add" among survey respondents, at 37%, followed by the Disney-operated Hulu at 33% and the upcoming HBO Max at 31%.
HBO Max was the leading service among those that recently launched or are launching this year, such as the mobile-only Quibi and NBCUniversal's Peacock. 
The chart below breaks down each TV genre:
The comedy genre also dominated among movie viewers, with 59% of respondents saying they were consuming comedy movies while home. This it notable considering comedies have struggled in theaters in recent years while blockbuster superhero movies dominate the box office.
But only 24% of respondents said they were watching superhero/comic-book movies while social distancing, suggesting audiences prefer a spectacle on the big screen while comedies provide comfort at home.

The comedy genre also dominated among movie viewers, with 59% of respondents saying they were consuming comedy movies while home. This it notable considering comedies have struggled in theaters in recent years while blockbuster superhero movies dominate the box office.
But only 24% of respondents said they were watching superhero/comic-book movies while social distancing, suggesting audiences prefer a spectacle on the big screen while comedies provide comfort at home.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Steve Carell will return to TV comedy with “Space Force,” which debuts this month on Netflix. It’s among the most anticipated new shows of the month.
Every month, Business Insider runs down the five most anticipated new shows using data from television-tracking app TV Time, derived from its millions of users around the world who use the app to track and react to what they’re watching.
May also sees the premiere of DC’s “Stargirl,” which will stream on DC Universe and air on the CW network the next day, and TNT’s “Snowpiercer,” which is based on “Parasite” director Bong Joon-ho’s 2013 sci-fi thriller of the same name.
Below are the five most anticipated new shows of May:
Description: “From Greg Daniels (The Office, Parks and Recreation) comes Upload, a new sci-fi comedy. In the near future, people who are near death can be ‘uploaded’ into virtual reality environments. Cash-strapped Nora works customer service for the luxurious ‘Lakeview’ digital afterlife. When party-boy/coder Nathan’s car crashes, his girlfriend uploads him into Nora’s VR world.”
Description: “A four-star general begrudgingly teams up with an eccentric scientist to get the U.S. military’s newest agency – Space Force – ready for lift-off.”
Description: “In post-World War II Hollywood, an ambitious group of aspiring actors and filmmakers will do almost anything to make their showbiz dreams come true.”
Description: “Set more than seven years after the world has become a frozen wasteland, Snowpiercer centers on the remnants of humanity who inhabit a perpetually moving train, with 1001 cars, that circles the globe. Class warfare, social injustice and the politics of survival play out in this riveting television adaptation based on the critically acclaimed graphic novel series and film of the same name.”
Description: “DC’s Stargirl follows high school sophomore Courtney Whitmore as she inspires an unlikely group of young heroes to stop the villains of the past. This new drama reimagines DC’s Stargirl and the very first superhero team, the Justice Society of America, in an unpredictable series. “

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kyle Walker's ex appears to have hit out at Lauryn Goodman after the birth of their baby.
Annie Kilner, 27, seemed to call Lauryn a ''heartless h**' in a thinly-veiled dig on Instagram on Sunday.
She had dated the England footballer, 29, for 10 years and had three children with him but they split in April after his affair with Laura Brown.
Lauryn, also 29, and Kyle briefly dated last summer and welcomed a baby last month but they aren't a couple.
Taking to Instagram on Sunday, an angry Annie wrote: "A man who disrespects a loyal woman deserves a heartless h**."
Lauryn appeared to take the dig as directed at her and fired back.
"This is harassment," she fumed.
"I've just had a new born baby and I'm dealing with this on a Sunday morning!'
She continued: "I just want to say thank you so much to everyone for your support.
"I am so lucky to have such supportive and caring followers who do not believe lies.
"I have said repeatedly, I was never ever friends with [Annie] and her using my name in the press to gain sympathy for a relationship that had ended before our baby's conception is shocking!"
Lauryn announced their baby's birth last month on Instagram, though she is yet to reveal the baby's sex or name.
She became a mum despite fearing she'd never have the chance thanks to her battle with endometriosis.
She said: "This has truly been the biggest blessing and I keep crying just thinking I can't believe I've made you and you are here. I find myself just staring in awe thinking I have made this little special human.
"You have defied all odds and you are the best thing to have ever happened to me. Words can't describe the love I feel for you already. My #endo baby - you have been so strong and I cannot wait to start this journey with you."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">REALITY TV star Amy Childs has confirmed she’s officially loved-up with new man Tim after she posted an emotional love letter to the hunk.
It’s the first time she has shared a photo of them together, and indeed him, after months of keeping quiet on her love life.
However it seems like Amy, 29, is very happy with her new man and couldn’t resist sharing a sweet tribute to him.
Posting a gorgeous snap of them on Instagram, the Essex star wrote: “When you finally meet the right one for you, it suddenly becomes clear why everyone else was so wrong .... ❤️ I love you”
Underneath the heartfelt declaration, boyfriend Tim replied: “Love you”.
Amy’s friends and followers were quick to heap praise on the couple, with Demi Sims writing: “So cute” and her cousin Harry Derbidge posting a series of love hearts in the comments.
Meanwhile one fan wrote: “You deserve so much happiness!!”
And a second added: “So happy for you hun xxxx”
While a third referenced her dating disaster on Celebs Go Dating, writing: “Jamie who…happy for you x”
Fans of the celebrity dating show were thrilled when it looked like Amy had met a keeper in hunky roofer Jamie, even going so far as meeting her family and children.
However, his true feelings came clear when he went on to snog another girl while on the freebie trip to the Dominican Republic.
Since the shambolic TV dating experience, she's been getting cosy with new man, Tim – and it’s clear she’s smitten.
Friends of the mum-of-two have said she’s "very excited" by her new flame.
An insider told New! magazine: "It's early days but Amy is very excited about Tim.
"We heard she went on a few dates with him last year but it wasn't the right time and it fizzled out.
"But they are back in touch and things are going really well."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kyle Walker’s ex takes swipe at the footballer and Lauryn Goodman after the birth of their baby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ENGLAND footballer Kyle Walker's ex has taken a swipe at him and Lauryn Goodman after the birth of their baby.
Annie Kilner, 27, took to her Instagram stories last night to post a savage quote hitting out at "disrespectful men".
The post read: "A man who disrespects a loyal woman deserves a heartless hoe."
Reality star Lauryn, 29, welcomed her baby with England footballer Kyle last week.
She posted a picture of the child on Instagram and wrote: "I can't believe I've made you."
Earlier this year The Sun exclusively revealed Kyle's long-term former partner Annie called him “gutless” after he broke the news of Lauryn's pregnancy to her over the phone.
She also called him a “homewrecker” for romping with her pal.
Annie told a friend: “He’s a fool for risking his family for this. When he told me I was heartbroken. I also felt physically sick. All the air in your body leaves you.
“My world completely caved in on me in that second.
“It was the worst-case scenario, the one thing I dreaded most but knew was possible, given his track record with women.
“I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Not only had he cheated on me but she was pregnant with his baby.”
Manchester City full-back Kyle, who Lauryn named as the dad in February, is now a father for the fourth time.
Posting on Instagram after the birth, Lauryn wrote: "I want to introduce you all to my #MiracleBaby. It was the first night in the SnüzPod and it felt so great to have the 👶🏽 so close to me all night ❤️.
"Whenever a feed was due I could just reach on in there. This has truly been the biggest blessing and I keep crying just thinking I can’t believe I’ve made you and you are here.
"I find myself just staring in awe thinking I have made this little special human. You have defied all odds and you are the best thing to have ever happened to me."
Lauryn, who had feared she was unlikely to conceive due to her endometriosis, continued: "Words can’t describe the love I feel for you already. My #endo baby - you have been so strong and I cannot wait to start this journey with you. 💫❤️.
"There is a bit of a story labour wise and after my labour that I do want to share with you all, as I feel it’s so important to be open and honest because my platform can help others.
"But for now, I just wanted to share this moment with you all as you have been so amazing with your advice and messages! My little bed buddy 👶🏽- Welcome to this crazy 🌍."
The star, who was careful not to reveal the child's gender, concluded: "Thank you to everyone who messaged me & recommended the SnüzPod @snuzuk it’s been a dream. P.s 👶🏽 needs its first hair cut already 🤦🏼‍♀️."
She was bombarded with congratulations, with Lauren Goodger writing: "I can’t believe it I’ve been waiting for this day ! Your amazing and I can’t wait to meet bubba 💕💕💕💕💕💕💕."
Her sister, 26-year-old reality star Chloe, wrote: "The most amazing blessing ever!! I’m so obsessed with the little one already I’ve never been so in love I’m so proud of you for how you dealt with pregnancy and your labour 🤩."
Former EastEnders star Jacqueline Jossa posted: "Congratulations ❤️❤️."
Lauryn revealed the identity of the child's father in an interview with The Sun on Sunday, saying: "Rumours and gossip are starting to circulate and I’d rather people heard it from the horse’s mouth so I want to stop all the speculation once and for all.
“Kyle Walker and I are expecting a baby in April and it was conceived during a period we had both split from our previous partners.
"This will be the last time I comment on it and I will only be sharing the positive journey going forward.”
Lauryn's sister Chloe is also pregnant and will soon give birth to her first child, a little girl, with fiancé Grant Hall.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kyle Walker's ex 'brands Lauryn Goodman heartless h**' after birth of their baby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kyle Walker's ex appears to have hit out at Lauryn Goodman after the birth of their baby.
Annie Kilner, 27, seemed to call Lauryn a ''heartless h**' in a thinly-veiled dig on Instagram on Sunday.
She had dated the England footballer, 29, for 10 years and had three children with him but they split in April after his affair with Laura Brown.
Lauryn, also 29, and Kyle briefly dated last summer and welcomed a baby last month but they aren't a couple.
Taking to Instagram on Sunday, an angry Annie wrote: "A man who disrespects a loyal woman deserves a heartless h**."
Lauryn appeared to take the dig as directed at her and fired back.
"This is harassment," she fumed.
"I've just had a new born baby and I'm dealing with this on a Sunday morning!'
She continued: "I just want to say thank you so much to everyone for your support.
"I am so lucky to have such supportive and caring followers who do not believe lies.
"I have said repeatedly, I was never ever friends with [Annie] and her using my name in the press to gain sympathy for a relationship that had ended before our baby's conception is shocking!"
Lauryn announced their baby's birth last month on Instagram, though she is yet to reveal the baby's sex or name.
She became a mum despite fearing she'd never have the chance thanks to her battle with endometriosis.
She said: "This has truly been the biggest blessing and I keep crying just thinking I can't believe I've made you and you are here. I find myself just staring in awe thinking I have made this little special human.
"You have defied all odds and you are the best thing to have ever happened to me. Words can't describe the love I feel for you already. My #endo baby - you have been so strong and I cannot wait to start this journey with you."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aww! Disha Patani and her boyfriend Tiger Shroff’s mother Ayesha Shroff’s social media banter over the former’s per dog is simply adorable
Just like Tiger Shroff, his rumoured girlfriend Disha Patani shares an amazing bond with his mother Ayesha and sister Krishna as well. We often come across Disha’s delightful social media banter with the Shroffs and it’s always a sight to behold. This time, however, the Bharat actress and Ayesha Shroff bonded over the former’s four-legged buddy, Goku. It all happened after Disha shared a happy video of her pooch jumping around the lawn in joy. Ayesha was quick to take notice and compliment the cutie.
The video sees Disha Patani’s pet dog Goku excitedly jumping in her lawn and playing with the grass. Needless to say, Goku, just like most of the dogs, was elated to head out. Disha in her caption wrote, “My goku #postlockdown.” Tiger’s mom Ayesha Shroff was pretty impressed with Goku, as she wrote, “He’s the cuuuuuuuuutest,” followed by lots of smiling and heart emoticons. The Malang actress was quick to reciprocate by leaving a couple of hearts under Ayesha’s comment.
Prior to this, Disha Patani had shared a sizzling BTS from Baaghi 3, which impressed Ayesha and Krishna to bits. The mother-daughter duo also left some compliments under Disha’s post.
Check them out:
Meanwhile, Disha, in an interview, revealed how the Baaghi franchise has helped her come a long way in Bollywood. She was quoted saying, “From sharpening my dancing skills to finally having a solo performance in 'Baaghi 3', the franchise has helped me come a long way. I am very grateful to be a part of the Baaghi family again.” (ALSO READ - Are Disha Patani And Tiger Shroff Really Living Together During Lockdown?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Stars and their star kids have their way of doing things in Bollywood which is almost unthinkable down in the South Film Industries. Tiger Shroff is quite a known name even to our audiences, though we know very little about his sister Krishna Shroff.
Krishna Shroff who always has been a free-spirited girl shared a picture of herself on Instagram. She was kissing her boyfriend Eban Hyams while she remained topless wearing a skimpy mini skirt. The guy’s face was well hidden, though.
This isn’t the first time she did something bold like this. Krishna Shroff has a history of sharing romantic pictures and videos of herself. Tiger Shroff and Krishna Shroff happen to be veteran actor Jackie Shroff’s children.

Jamie, 46, shared the series of snaps of his mum in view of his 1.2 million Instagram followers.
He captioned the photo with: "Happy birthday to this incredible lady. We adore you mum.
"Thanks for your wisdom, love and care.
"You have been a rock throughout my life, given me support that I hope I can give my kids throughout their lives too. I miss you and I can’t wait to see you.

"No doubt you will be waiting on dad hand and foot today! But make sure he looks after you.
"See you soon when this is over and love you always. Your boy Jamie."
Judging by the caption he is likely unable to celebrate her birthday with her in person due to the coronavirus lockdown restrictions.
The first picture shows him smiling at a restaurant alongside his glam mum. The next picture shows Sandra with who we believe are to be four of her five grandchildren.
And the final snap shows Sandra enjoying a glass of white wine as she lounges bikini-clad on a sun lounger.
She looks absolutely fantastic in the bikini pic and fans can't get enough of how young and in shape she looks.

One wrote: "Wow no excuse for corona kilos when you see how fit and healthy your mummy is! What a gorgeous lady. Happy Birthday Sandra."
A second gushed: "Wow happy birthday. Your mum looks amazing, I can’t believe she has six pack x."
And a third praised: "Wow look at her incredible figure! Go on Mrs R! Happy birthday and have a lovely day x."
Several of Jamie's celebrity friends also wished his mum a happy day.
Susanna Reid posted: "Love your Mum - Happy Birthday Sandra - look forward to seeing your smiling again at some point."
Former The Apprentice star and current Real Housewives of Beverly Hills husband Paul Kemsley wrote: "Happy Bday Sandra x."
And David Walliams cheekily posted: "Hot Mama" to which Jamie valiantly replied with: "Stop it Walliams! She is taken!"

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Halle Berry stripped naked for her latest social media offering as she posed in a nude selfie.
The actress, 53, told her 6.1 million followers that she was indulging in some self-care.
She added that she's been using Taraji P Henson's products, paying tribute to her pal and urging fans to give her stuff a go.
"I've known this woman since she started in the industry," Halle wrote, "And it's been such a joy to watch her flourish and succeed.
"Obsessed with this line, check my stories for a few of my favourites!"
The Hollywood icon recently reminisced about her time in the industry, including her work on Die Another Day, Pierce Brosnan's last Bond film before he hung up the mantle.
Halle recalled that the Irish actor, now 66, had to give her the Heimlich Manoeuvre as she choked on a fig during a steamy sex scene.
Chatting with American talk show host Jimmy Fallon from her home, she dished: "I was supposed to be all sexy, trying to seduce him with a fig, and then I ended up choking on it and he had to get up and do the Heimlich.
"James Bond knows how to Heimlich!
"He was there for me, he will always be one of my favourite people in the world."
She was playing love interest and fellow spy Jinx, revealing that the studio had even flirted with the idea of giving her character her own spinoff flick.
She's also been battling online trolls since going into lockdown, clapping back at those who passed judgement on her for letting six year old Maceo-Robert wear high heels.
"Is this your daughter or your son?" one wrote.
She came back: "Well it's a he and he is having a ball. Tryna cope the best he can! Laughter helps a lot right now."

The 31-year-old model — who is mostly known for being an Instagram influencer — was photographed inside of her bedroom. She took center stage in the photo and exuded a sexy vibe as she posed directly in front of the camera while sitting down on her bed. Her right arm held her cellphone up to her face, meanwhile her left arm was raised up to her long blond hair, which did not appear to be styled as it cascaded down her back in messy waves.
Abby, as per usual, sported a very glamourous makeup look in the snapshot. The application included a light-pink lipstick, sculpted eyebrows, peach eyeshadow, eyelash extensions, eyeliner, blush, bronzer, and foundation. However, it was her famous figure that demanded the most attention in the snapshot, as she put her killer curves on display in a racy ensemble.
Up top, the model sported a leather bra that featured two thin straps that went over her shoulders and down her back, as well as a leather strap that tied around her midriff. The black garment also featured tiny triangular cups that struggled to contain her voluptuous assets as they exposed an ample amount of cleavage, and sideboob.
Abby paired the revealing top with a tiny leather miniskirt that also did not provide much coverage. The skintight garment further flaunted Abby’s curvaceous hips and pert derriere while exposing most of her thighs.
The model finished the look off with a pair of chunky black boots and a number of jewelry pieces.
She did not provide a geotag for the image but revealed in the post’s caption that the outfit was manufactured by Dolls Kill, an online clothing company.
The sizzling photo was met with a great deal of support and approval from fans, garnering more than 10,000 likes in the first two hours after going live. More than 200 followers also took to the comments section to compliment the model on her killer curves and daring outfit.
“Can’t even handle it,” one user commented
“The hottest look,” added a second follower.
“Gorgeous,” a third admirer chimed in.
“Smoking hot,” proclaimed a fourth fan.
The beauty has shared more than one sexy look on her Instagram this past weekend. Just earlier today, she sent hearts racing after she rocked a sheer mesh outfit that left very little to the imagination, per The Inquisitr. That snap received more than 29,000 likes so far.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kylie Jenner is flaunting her curvy beach body in revealing bathing suit photos that she shared with her 173.2 million Instagram followers. Kylie went viral after photos of her without any makeup on and carrying a bag of chips as she went to see a friend made their way online. Since that event, people have accused the 22-year-old billionaire of staging photoshoots in order to remind people that she’s really gorgeous. No one doubted her beauty, and many people responded to the photos by saying that she looked better as her natural self. Still, it seems that Kylie is most comfortable with darker skin, an exaggerated lip line, and hairpieces. Like her sisters, Kylie is frequently accused of undergoing plastic surgery to alter her figure and also like her sisters, she denies going under the knife. Still, Kylie’s figure has changed drastically and she continually shows it off in skimpy bikinis on her social media platforms.
In the newer photos, Kylie Jenner was seen straddling a board in a swimming pool. She is wearing a Love Wave bikini. The Nadia bikini top costs about $98 and the Campbell Bottom costs about $75. The bikini features a shimmery pattern in pastel pink, blue, and yellow. Kylie Jenner shared photos of herself in multiple poses including several pictures where she stood up and showed off her curvy backside to the camera.
You may see the photos that Kylie Jenner shared with her Instagram followers in the slideshow player below.
Kylie Jenner, like many other celebrities, may be missing the days when social distancing wasn’t the norm and she could go travel to exotic locations living the luxurious life with friends and family on a yacht. Kylie went to the Bahamas shortly before the pandemic hit and has since been under lockdown in her home.
She shared additional photos of herself seated in a wooden beach chair while wearing a bikini on Instagram. You may see those photos below.
Are you having a hard time with social distancing and staying home? Can you relate to Kylie Jenner’s photo caption where she was wished she was on the beach?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">American actress Halle Berry, 53, has recently shared a steamy selfie on Instagram - it shows her just out of the shower, her hair wet and her makeup-free face covered with water droplets.
Berry wrote that she was enjoying some time for self-care during the coronavirus lockdown.
The picture has received more than 200,000 likes, and the actress's fans expressed their admiration with her natural beauty.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When there is hope in her name, we can use it for a little rhetoric that sounds nice, can’t we? We are talking about Tanya Hope, the Bangalore actress who was last seen in Ravi Teja’s ‘Disco Raja’ and also starred in four Telugu movies previously.
What do you think about Tanya in this latest pic? We know you’ll say, she is sensuous. The lighting is perfect on her beautiful skin.
For us, this pic is her hot and feminine vision of 2020. But, she says Tanya has got her 2020 vision when she sees her fans and followers.
That must be her inspiration, and Tanya’s hot and gorgeous pics will be the real inspiration for her followers on social media to log in to check out her hot pics.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sherlyn Chopra is often related to sensuality and has a global appeal for her se*ual appeal. More often than not, the actress has hit headlines for her bold and nearly nude photos and the derogatory comments that follow.
But none of that has ever deterred Sherlyn Chopra from being the kind of person that she is. Neither has the brutal trolling ever made the actress change the kind content that she shares on her social media handle.
Now, Sherlyn Chopra has finally opened up about her bold pictures and what s*x appeal actually means to her. The Game actress also opened up on being the first Indian actress to feature on an American adult magazine cover. Speaking to IBT, Chopra said, “Most perceptions are fickle and frivolous. The thing that I value the most is genuineness. I’ve never pretended or claimed to be somebody who I am not. There is sincerity & honesty in my craft which I truly treasure.”
Opening up on her inspirations to all her nude photos and steamy videos, Sherlyn Chopra said, “The truth of the matter is that I was tired of living up to the expectations of my school teachers & my church pastors. In my efforts to please them, I never realised who I really aspired to be or what I really wanted to pursue in life. After winning the Miss Andhra beauty pageant at the age of 17, I realised that there was more to me than just textbook knowledge. I started experiencing life not as a book worm but as a girl who was on the verge of metamorphosing into a s**y butterfly.”
But what also got our attention was Sherlyn Chopra’s rather brutal jibe at Rakhi Sawant. Sherlyn was asked who according to her has the least s*x appeal in the industry and pat came the reply, “I don’t know!!! I guess, Rakhi Sawant. I’m just kidding! Hope she doesn’t kill me!”
Well, that certainly was quite a response! Do let us know what you think about the sizzling actress. And if you don’t trust us…feel free to check her social media handles for ample proof!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Category is… looking absolutely flawless! Gabrielle Union, 47, appeared half her age in a set of Instagram photos posted on Friday, May 1, during her time in self-isolation. Each pic was totally different from the rest where her radiant beauty was seen throughout. In one snap she cracked a shy smirk which was then followed by her putting her pearly whites on display. A cute smile was seen in the next upload which ended with an adorable photo with her stepdaughter Zaya Wade, 12. “OK y’all so I’ve been working on improving my skin during quarantine (ill share those deets soon) and I feel pretty good about where I’m at but (I) wanted to pop my skin with a little something for these zoom calls without putting on a full face of makeup,” she revealed.
Gabrielle then gave props to none other than Rihanna, 32, for helping her out with her skin issue! “I saw someone online say they only use concealer and bronzer and I was like BUT I tried it and didn’t even use concealer just my @fentybeauty bronzer (Caramel Cutie) and BISHHHH this was the result!!!!” she wrote. “Now, I found my light of course but… okkkkkkkkkk also NOT AN AD, just sharing what I learned. Happy Friday folks!!! Zoom innnnnn on this skinnnnnnnnnnnn.”
The Fenty bronzer and Gabrielle’s already beautiful face was a lethal weapon of gorgeousness that clearly worked. “Thought this was a throwback. Skin is glowing yo!”, host Desus Nice, 38, wrote in the comments section. “Ok, how do you do this? This thing, called aging backwards?!!,” another wrote. “How? Incredible!”
Gabrielle’s also enjoyed some romantic moments with her husband Dwyane Wade, 38, while they remain in self-isolation. They cozied up in their pool on Friday, April 17, where the former Bring It On star sizzled in a sexy blue bikini.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sherlyn Chopra, who is known as one of the boldest, breathtaking and controversial divas in the Indian showbiz, has recently opened up about all her controversies, lifestyle and sex appeal.
The 36-year-old diva has always managed to stay in limelight with bold and nude pictures on her social media handles. Recently, she mocked another controversy queen, Rakhi Sawant in an interview with IBTimes.
In an interview, when Sherlyn was asked about who has the least sex appeal in the industry, she said, "I don't know!!! I guess, Rakhi Sawant. I'm just kidding! Hope she doesn't kill me!"
Sherlyn Chopra is the first woman to have posed nude for the cover of an adult American magazine. When asked it, Sherlyn said, "Most perceptions are fickle and frivolous. The thing that I value the most is genuineness. I've never pretended or claimed to be somebody who I am not. There is sincerity & honesty in my craft which I truly treasure."
Nowadays, celebrities try to impress their fans with their sex appeal. But Sherlyn Chopra has a different take on it. She said, "For me, sex appeal is 99 per cent mental and 1 per cent physical. There are so many people who have great physiques but uninspiring personalities. It's a sad situation."
Sherlyn Chopra often shares her nude pictures on social media for which she gets various kind of replies. Speaking about the same, Sherlyn said, "Now, I live to please myself. I shoot pics & videos to entertain myself and when I share the same with the world, not only do they appreciate it but also pay a price to watch my premium content on the Sherlyn Chopra App."
After sharing nude pictures, Sherlyn Chopra often receives derogatory comments. When asked about how she deals with it, Sherlyn said, "My late father had taught me to never take anything personally from people whom I don't know personally. So, I simply refuse to give my attention to naysayers. As a matter of fact, most naysayers are unemployed, bored, frustrated and dejected and they love to constantly engage in unnecessary hostile and combative interactions with strangers."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Zimbabwe Entertainment News Digest
South African based businesswoman and socialite Luminitsa Jemwa has re-activated her social media accounts after deactivating them. Fans and her industry friends were this week elated at her return to the social media streets. Sometime last year, Luminitsa without giving warning to her fans deactivated her official Instagram account.  At the time, rumours went flying that the beauty, who was named Zimbabwe’s sexiest woman in 2019, was keeping a low profile because she was pregnant and now happily married. Although she is still yet to comment on the matter, that’s for another day. We are just ecstatic about her return. Maybe soon enough, the curvaceous beauty will treat us to some eye candy.
In other news. It seems that there might be a rivalry brewing between late former President Robert Mugabe’s son, Chatunga Bellarmine and businessman Tawona ‘Teemak’ Chipunza and his counterpart Prince Mudzingwa, commonly known as Mr Stylz. This follows after Chatunga took to social media and fired shots at the duo, alleging that they had created a fake social media account in his name, for reasons not yet clear to this publication.
It is also not yet clear whether these allegations are true or false as Teemak and Mr Styles are yet to respond. This is not the first time that Chatunga has come out guns blazing and attacked the crew. Sometime back, he hogged headlines after dissing Mr Stylz, claiming that he was not moneyed as much as people think he is.
In another story you shouldn’t miss, South African based comedian Pepukai Zvemhari, more popularly known by his moniker, Baba Tencen has again set tongues wagging on social media. This time around, the outspoken comic who seems to have a knack for igniting controversy, offered some advice to Zimbabwean women, saying that the Coronavirus induced lockdown should award them time to mend marital disputes and connect with their spouses.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NORMAL People star Paul Mescal, who plays Connell in the hit BBC drama, has hit back at those criticising the show’s controversial sex scenes.
The 12-part series has been dubbed the “horniest show on TV” and been praised by many for its representation of sexual consent.
However the raunchy scenes have proved a particularly contentious talking point in Ireland, where the series is set.
Listeners to RTÉ Radio 1 Liveline show likened the scenes to “something you would expect to see in a porno movie” but Paul Mescal, who plays lead role Connell, has hit back revealing he’s "incredibly proud" of the love scenes.
Speaking on the RTE One’s The Late Late Show, he said: “I actually listened in [to Liveline] yesterday, and I suppose I was a bit surprised, but the last thing I want to do is sit and judge people for that, because they’re entitled to their opinion.
“My own perspective of it is we worked hard to make it feel like it was a real, accurate and truthful representation of sex amongst young people.
“It’s something I’m incredibly proud of and incredibly proud to see on Irish screens, personally.”
Normal People is a TV adaptation of Sally Rooney’s best-selling novel of the same name, whichcentres around two Irish teenagers from different backgrounds who fall in love.
Set in County Sligo, Ireland, Normal People follows the couple through their highs and lows and touches on the power and vulnerability of first love.
Paul, 24, plays Connell, Daisy Edgar-Jones, 21, plays Marianne. The duos performances have won them rave reviews and become an overnight sensation.
Normal People is available to stream now on BBC iPlayer. Weekly double episodes air Mondays on BBC One from 9pm.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Normal People actress Daisy Edgar-Jones says she's proud of the way the show portrays consent - but a sexpert slams its 'very unhealthy' BDSM sex scenes which left her 'wincing'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A sexpert has slammed controversial sex scenes in the BBC drama Normal People, claiming they left her 'wincing' - while actress Daisy Edgar-Jones says she's 'proud' of the show's portrayal of consent.
All 12 episodes of the series were released on BBC iPlayer last week and fans have rushed to praise the adaptation of the hit Sally Rooney novel, saying sex scenes between Connell, played by Paul Mescal, and Daisy's character Marianne should be taught in schools as an example of consent. 
Speaking to Evanna Lynch and Riyadh Khalaf on the BBC's Obsessed With... podcast Daisy, 21, said seeing communicative consensual sex on TV shouldn't be 'novel'.
She said: 'One of the things I think is really brilliantly done in the series and one of the things very I'm proud to be a part of is the depiction of Marianne's first time with Connell.'
The series has been lauded by fans for it's realistic bedroom scenes, but sex expert Alix Fox slammed some of the storylines, particularly its exploration of BDSM, as 'unhealthy'. 
While viewers have already labelled the series 'perfect' and praised the show for 'capturing the atmosphere of the book', sexpert Alix said she found some of the show's sex scenes 'ominous'. 
Speaking on the same podcast, Alix said: 'I can't say I giggled at a lot of the sex in this show, a lot of it had me wincing. There are some beautiful and tender moments but a lot of it is tinged with the sense it's about to be lost or there's a high stake of trepidation.'
Alix explained that the sex in the show was an important part of the storytelling, and not gratuitous, but said she found it frustrating that Marianne and Connell appeared to communicate so well in the bedroom, but struggled so much outside it.  
'The people might love each other but they don't love themselves,' she said. 
'What aggravated me, even thought it's important to the story, is that they had this loving communicative sex but they didn't communicate any further after sex.
'They don't move things forward, they come together, literally, and move apart in the same sequence, they both had to go through other things.'  
And while she said the sex scenes with Connell were the most communicative, Alix added there were 'ominous aspects'. 
She explained: 'Connell asks, "Does this hurt?" and she says, "Yes, it's nice." I find it poignant that one of her first sexual experience about pain.  
'More broadly women are expected to get sex to hurt, and I think although that's not the only influence on Marianne's sexuality, I think that may have fed into her expectation.'
She added in later scenes, where Marianne was seeing Jamie, the sex is 'very unhealthy' and not 'S&M' but instead abuse.  
'We know that Jamie is aggressive and not just in the bedroom, he's abusive through their entire relationship, it's something he likes, when she talks about it she says it's a thing she's doing, she never expresses excitement, it sounds like a chore.'
Meanwhile Daisy explained she was proud of the programme, saying: 'I just love the way that Connell asks and makes sure she's 100 per cent comfortable with everything. 
'When I grew up that kind of thing and sex as a topic was taboo but I feel we're in a different time now, and shows like Sex Education are helping us be able to openly and healthily about how to have sex in that way.
'I hope that younger people see that and that shouldn't be a novel thing, it should be the norm that someone makes sure you're safe and comfortable with everything. 
Daisy added that she got 'used to' being naked in the show, even though she was previously so conscious of her body that she would hide in female changing rooms.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Normal People's Paul Mescal brushes off sex scenes backlash in native Ireland</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Normal People star Paul Mescal has brushed off the controversy surrounding the series’ sex scenes in his native Ireland.
The 24-year-old, who plays Connell in the series, was interviewed on RTE One’s Late Late Show, where he admitted it had been ‘a very bizarre 72 hours’ after the show dropped.
An adaption of Sally Rooney’s best-selling novel, the show follows the complicated romantic lives of students Connell (Mescal) and Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones). The nature of the sex scenes included in the episode drew particular ire in Ireland, where the country’s Liveline radio show hosted a debate on the topic.
Speaking on the backlash, Mescal brushed off any criticism, saying peers had thanked him for the series for ‘portraying young people in a society that they recongnise.’
‘I actually listened in [to Liveline] yesterday,’ he said. ‘and I suppose I was a bit surprised, but the last thing I want to do is sit and judge people for that, because they’re entitled to their opinion.
‘My own perspective of it is we worked hard to make it feel like it was a real, accurate and truthful represention of sex amongst young people.
‘It’s something I’m incredibly proud of and incredibly proud to see on Irish screens, personally.’
We’ve already weighed in on this issue – arguing that just because Normal People shows teenagers having healthy, consensual sex, it doesn’t mean it’s going to inspire them to have the sex they were probably already having anyway.
Paul’s co-star Daisy hasn’t weighed in on the controversy, but she did yesterday post a host of excellent behind-the-scenes snaps taken as the drama was being filmed.
Brb, just stalking her entire feed.
Daisy also previously shared some insider info into the auditioning process on the show – admitting that she had to ‘snog the air.’
Which, we’re sure looked totally fine.
Anyway, don’t mind us we’re just going to binge the entire, perfect series again and cry.
Normal People is available to stream now via BBC iPlayer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul Mescal gives his take on Normal People's sex scenes debate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel has been causing a stir among some viewers who have compared the sex scenes in episode two to something you'd see in a porno
Normal People's Paul Mescal who plays Connell in the BBC adaptation of Sally Rooney's novel has given his take on the sex scenes thus far.
The actor was interviewed on The Late Late Show last night via video link with Ryan Tubridy bringing up the widely talked about Liveline feature on Normal People.
As you are probably aware by now, some viewers phoned in to Joe Duffy to liken the sex scenes in episode two of the series to something you would see in a porno.
One caller named Mary said: "I imagined it would be something you'd expect to see in a porno movie. Certainly not for family viewing."
Another called Tommy added: "I feel it was a bit pornographic, maybe in one or two scenes. I feel that young actress is being exploited and used just to get the ratings.
"It's giving the wrong message to young people. I have two daughters and if they think that that's what's going on in secondary school, it's shocking."
Well, last night while chatting to Ryan, the Normal People star responded to how some viewers have reacted to the show's sex scenes.
Mescal said the sex scenes are something he is really proud of as they are something the team worked really hard on to portray an accurate representation of "sex amongst young people today".
He told Ryan: "The last thing I want to do is sit and judge people for that, because they're obviously entitled to their opinion.
"My own perspective is that we worked hard - myself, Lenny, Daisy and Hettie - we worked very hard to make it feel like it was a real, accurate and truthful representation of sex amongst young people today and it's actually something I'm incredibly proud of and something I'm really proud to see on Irish screens, personally."
Normal People tracks the on-off relationship between two youths, from attending the same school together in a small Sligo town to going to college and beyond.
It is a tale of modern love and how Marianne and Connell grapple with the challenges society throws at them during pivotal stages in their lives.
To catch up on the first two episodes of Normal People you can do so via the RTE Player. Don't forget to tune into RTE One next Tuesday for the third episode either.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why the conversation around Normal People's sex scenes shows how Ireland has changed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SALLY ROONEY’S SECOND novel Normal People became a bestseller after its release – and now the TV adaptation is making headlines across Ireland, Europe and the US.
While there have been articles dedicated to everything from whether the series will bring back the ‘jock’ to TV, to people’s obsession with the chain the character Connell wears, here in Ireland much focus has been put on the sex scenes in the series.
This week, an episode of Liveline on RTÉ Radio One was dedicated to the issue. But while some of the callers took issue with the frank depiction of sex between the two main characters, Marianne (Daisy Edgar-Jones) and Connell (Paul Mescal), what was notable was that the majority of the callers did not find fault with it.
The book and TV series depict the beginnings of a loving, consensual sexual relationship between Marianne and Connell (things get a little more complicated as the book progresses).
However, one complaint to LiveLine said that what was shown was “like something from a porno”. When asked by the show’s host Joe Duffy what could a person see in a ‘porno’, the caller replied that she didn’t know, as she’d never seen one.
Another caller criticised the TV show for depicting “fornication”. However, the majority of contributors praised Normal People for its depiction of consent between two teenagers as they begin to explore their sexual relationship.
RTÉ said that it had not received any formal complaints about the series so far, but had been contacted by members of the public about the episode’s content:
Call-in shows like Liveline might not always capture the full breadth of opinions on a topic, but they do shed light on how controversial a TV show or movie is.
That people are exercised enough to phone a radio station shows that there is definitely a level of disquiet there. But the reaction to Normal People also showed that attitudes towards sex and nudity on Irish TV have most certainly changed.
Donald Clarke, film critic with the Irish Times, told TheJournal.ie what happened in 1978, when a naked woman was shown on an episode of the RTÉ show Spike.
“It was fascinating – I was very young at the time but old enough to remember it all happening. Spike was a TV series set in a Dublin school – a rough kitchen sink drama – and it trundled along fine and got respectable reviews and viewership. Until there was an episode with David Kelly playing an art teacher. The crucial difficulty was he had a life class and brought in a nude woman,” said Clarke. “They didn’t show her fully frontally nude – she pressed her body to a frosted glass sheet through which she was viewed.”
That one scene became national news. “The show was taken off air and questions were asked in the Dáil. People were phoning up the radio stations furiously – but what was even then notable was this was not the first time there had been nudity on RTÉ,” said Clarke. There had already been films, like Billy Wilder’s Avanti, which showed some nudity on the station.
“But what disturbed people – and this brings us forward to the current kerfuffle – was it was an Irish girl who had done this,” pointed out Clarke. “And nobody really minded that much [about the other incidents], there were occasional complaints here and there, but it didn’t become a proper scandal until this happened.”
Another show that came under criticism – but for a different reason – was Executive Suite in 1976, a glossy soap opera which ran for one season. “Its only claim to fame was in Ireland there was an episode broadcast, which as I recall had a warning, that had an abortion in it. One of the characters had an abortion – it wasn’t shown. That was sufficient to have the series cancelled. That was enough in itself to have RTÉ take a deep breath and cancel the series. That wasn’t about decency, it was a political issue, an issue about approaching morality.”
But by the 1980s, things had started to change. “Like a lot of things in Ireland, the 60s didn’t happen until the 80s,” said Clarke. Things changed again after the millennium. 
One of the most important moves was John Kelleher’s installation as Film Censor in 2003, succeeding Sheamus Smith. It wasn’t long before Kelleher’s appointment that Quentin Tarantino’s From Dusk Till Dawn and Oliver Stone’s Natural Born Killers fell foul of the censor and were banned from being shown in Ireland. 
A pivotal moment, said Clarke, was when Kelleher granted an 18 certificate to Michael Winterbottom’s film Nine Songs, which featured real sex in it, in 2004. Censorship in Ireland had reached a new age. 
“That was itself [important], but what was as important was that it wasn’t a huge sandal; it wasn’t on the front pages,” said Clarke – who, for the record, didn’t give the film a very good review, but not because of the sexual content. 
When Winterbottom appeared on the Late Late Show, the detractors in the audience who complained about the film “certainly seemed like the outsiders, whereas 20, 30 years previously they would not have been seen like that – it would have seemed like equal debate”, said Clarke.
Clarke saw a reflection of that in this week’s Liveline discussion. While Joe Duffy was as patient as ever, he wasn’t afraid of gently steering them away when the contributors were bringing up unrelated topics (like abortion), or pointing out fallacies in what they were saying. The complainants were also not in the majority. 
“That demonstrates what has changed so much since 1978, where in the Spike coverage there were very few people who were turning up on public media to make the case for it. It felt they were putting their head above the parapet if they did. Now people who have conservative attitudes, it does feel like they’re putting their head above the parapet,” said Clarke.
“It demonstrates a real shift in attitude.”
Consent
That shift in attitude is also demonstrated by the positive reaction to Rooney’s depiction of consensual sex.
The issue of consent is one that has been to the fore in the past few years, with some colleges introducing consent classes. So Normal People’s take on things was welcomed by Orla O’Connor, director of the National Women’s Council of Ireland, who told TheJournal.ie:
These sentiments were echoed by Noeline Blackwell of the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, who said that they “would join in the general applause for the centrality of consent to the sex scenes”.
“We get asked a lot about how it’s possible to communicate consent without killing the joy – as if it wasn’t really possible,” she said.
“This adaptation is showing how it is possible to communicate about consent, how to check in with your partner. I find it striking that they approach their love and desire as equals – that’s why it looks so consensual.”
Dr Caroline West, a lecturer and writer on sexuality studies, said that the discussions around Normal People on social media “have been fascinating”.
“Many people have expressed a kind of shock in seeing sex depicted in such a gentle, consensual way,” she said. “However this shock isn’t surprising if we bear in mind that we are used to onscreen portrayals of sex that are divisive, such as in mainstream porn, or in Hollywood, which often does a poor job of including conversations about consent in sex scenes.”
For her, Normal People brings up more than just consent. “We have seen a discourse about kindness flourish in the past few months, and Normal People seems to tie into that,” she said.
“Good sex is sex that is consensual, respectful and mutually pleasurable. Kindness underlines these factors, and it feels like a relief to see this on our screens, especially when we need kindness in so many areas right now.”
Normal People continues on RTÉ One at 10.15pm on Tuesday 5 May. The show is also broadcast on BBC in the UK and Hulu in the USA.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Diana 'tried to kill herself four times', new documentary claims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new documentary will claim Princess Diana attempted to kill herself four times and it could be aired on Netflix.
The four-parter - titled 'Being Me: Diana' - will air the struggles of the beloved royal and lay bare her mental health battles and eating disorders.
It will tell all about Diana’s troubled childhood right the way through to her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles.
It is at that point in her life where she tried to to take her own life, the show is set to claim.
The series will also reveal never-before-seen footage from Diana’s speeches in 1990-92. It will make difficult viewing for Prince William and Harry, 23 years on from their mother's death in Paris.
DSP, the TV company behind ITV’s Torvill and Dean, are behind the controversial project, according to The Sun.
It has not yet been officially commissioned by Netflix but filming is already said to have started, sources suggest.
Mirror Online have approached Netflix for comment.
And it will especially be a blow to Harry and his wife Meghan Markle, who are said to be in talks with the streaming giant over future projects.
Harry also worked with Netflix on a Thomas The Tank Engine 75th anniversary special shown only this week.
A TV source told The Sun: “The royals have all refused to take part as have the Spencer family (Diana’s family).
“William and Harry will be very upset and angry. It’s particularly distressing for Harry because he’s been working with Netflix.
"At a time when the royals have been dealt a blow with Harry and Meghan leaving, the timing is not good.”
Harry and Meghan are currently looking into new commercial projects as they settle down in Los Angeles, California after quitting as senior royals.
Meghan has already bagged herself a role narrating a Disney documentary, with the couple reportedly hiring an agent to bag them more big roles.
The couple and their baby son Archie are now living a financially independent life after their decisions to step down from the Royal Family means no more taxpayer funds or HRH titles.
Mirror Online has contacted Netflix for a comment.
The Samaritans is there for those who have nowhere else to turn.

Netflix has not yet commissioned the programme but TV company DSP has apparently started preparing the project.
Being Me: Diana will also feature claims that the late princess tried to take her own life four times, according to The Sun.
It will also reportedly include unseen footage from Diana’s speeches in 1990-92 and interviews with people close to her.
According to a TV source, quoted in the tabloid, none of her family will take part.
They said: "The royals will refuse to take part as will the Spencer family.
"William and Harry will be very upset and angry. It’s particularly distressing for Harry because he’s been working with Netflix.
"At a time when the royals have been dealt a blow with Harry and Meghan leaving, the timing is not good."
A spokeswoman for Endemol Shine, the parent company for DSP, said: "This is a not a commissioned show and everything within the treatment is already in the public domain."
Harry collaborated with the TV streaming service on a Thomas the Tank Engine 75th anniversary special.

Harry recorded a special message for the show recalling his fond memories of watching the iconic series.
He said: "Thomas the Tank Engine has been a comforting, familiar face to so many families over the last 75 years - entertaining, educating and inspiring children on important issues through exciting stories and characters.
"I certainly have fond memories of growing up with Thomas & Friends and being transported to new places through his adventures.
"Very proud to have been asked to take part in this special episode. I wish Thomas & Friends a very happy anniversary."
Prince Harry even carried a Thomas the Tank Engine bag on his first day at nursery school!
He and Meghan are reportedly in talks with Netflix over future projects.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princes William and Harry will be 'very upset and angry' over controversial new documentary series which is set to claim Princess Diana tried to kill herself four times</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princes William and Harry are set to be 'very upset and angry' over a controversial new documentary which will claim that Princess Diana tried to kill herself four times.
According to The Sun, a four-part series provisionally called 'Being Me: Diana' will delve into the mental torment the late royal suffered - from battling eating disorders to her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles and painful childhood.
It will use unseen footage from Diana's speeches filmed before the Princess of Wales' death in 1997, as well as interviews with people who were close to her to shed light on her inner turmoil shortly before her split from Charles in 1992.  
The series is being made by TV company DSP, which was behind 127 Hours and ITV's Torvill And Dean. The project is planned for Netflix but has not yet been commissioned. 
It's set to be particularly upsetting for Harry, who worked with the streaming service on a Thomas The Tank Engine 75th anniversary special after he and Meghan Markle stepped down as senior royals earlier this year. 
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are also believed to be in talks with Netflix about other future projects. 
A TV source told the publication that The Firm will refuse to take part in the documentary series, as will the Spencer family. 
'William and Harry will be very upset and angry', they added. 'It's particularly distressing for Harry because he's been working with Netflix.
'At a time when the royals have been dealt a blow with Harry and Meghan leaving, the timing is not good.'  
A spokeswoman for Endemol Shine, the parent company for DSP, told The Sun: 'This is a not a commissioned show and everything within the treatment is already in the public domain.'
Charles and Diana tied the knot at St Paul's Cathedral in front of 2,000 people on July 29, 1981.
In 1992, Prime Minster John Major announced the couple were to separate, but continue living together at Kensington Palace.
They divorced in 1996 and a year later Diana died in a car crash in Paris. In 2005 Prince Charles married Camilla Parker Bowles at Windsor Guildhall.
In video footage released late last month, the Duke of Sussex introduced a new program for Netflix called 'Thomas and Friends: The Royal Engine', which features his father and grandmother, Prince Charles and the Queen, as animated characters.
A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman confirmed the project had been in the pipeline for a 'long time' and added that 'everybody was aware' of it before it aired, including the Queen.  
The episode was recorded before Harry and wife Meghan quit as senior royals and moved to America. 
Proceeds from the anniversary edition, which aired in the US one day before the UK, are being donated to environment and sustainability projects under Harry's Travalyst project. 
In his introduction, Prince Harry is seen sitting in an armchair, reading from a book about the train's adventures. 
The 35-year-old, who is now living in Los Angeles, said: 'Thomas the Tank Engine has been a comforting, familiar face to so many families over the last 75 years - entertaining, educating and inspiring children on important issues through exciting stories and characters.
'I certainly have fond memories of growing up with Thomas & Friends and being transported to new places through his adventures.
'I am very proud to have been asked to take part in this special episode. I wish Thomas and Friends a very happy anniversary.' 
Meghan has carried out similar work in the wake of seeking financial independence and moving to the US, narrating the Disney+ documentary Elephant which started streaming on April 3, three days after she and Harry officially quit royal life. She too donated proceeds from the project to charity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Designer Dame Zandra Rhodes reveals she sleeps in her make-up and never leaves the house without it - and admits she doesn't have eyebrows after she 'plucked them all out' in the Sixties</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">She is as famous for her shocking pink bob and rainbow make-up as she is for dressing Princess Diana and a host of celebrities from Shirley Bassey to Nicole Richie.
Now Dame Zandra Rhodes, 79, from Kent, has revealed how she is maintaining her striking image during lockdown.
The fashion and textile designer, who is currently appearing in BBC1's The Real Marigold Hotel, said she never goes out out without a full face of make-up - and even keeps on when she goes to bed at night.
She told Susannah Constantine in the latest video episode of My Wardrobe Malfunction: 'I never ever go out without make-up.
'I sleep with my make up on, I wash it in the morning, and then I make myself up again in the morning.'
Speaking about her current look, she added: 'At the moment, I just have demure brown eyebrows,' while lifting up her fringe. 
'I don't have eyebrows because in the 1960s I plucked them all out.
'I first of all had little glitter dots, then when it was punk I had long and short eyebrows. I've done lines all round my eyes, eyelashes.
'It's been a bit too long like this but I have to think it out or wait until I do another wonderful picture with someone and then I'll rework it.'
With salons shut across the UK, Zandra has also been maintaining her bright pink hair herself while on lockdown.
She said: 'I dye it myself. It's bleached and then I dye it myself and, when it looks like I've got too much grey, I touch it up, because I haven't got a hairdresser to do that bit.
'She would have a heart attack because it really does need a neat trim. She has a heart attack when she sees how I've trimmed my fringe.
'I have a stash of Pinkissimo dye and I think I use cyclamen and Pinkissimo mixed together.
'I sleep in a very ugly plastic hat and pull it off in the morning. If the grey shows, I dab it on and hope it looks all right.' 
The designer, whose partner Salah Hassanein died last year, also revealed that even she has the occasional wardrobe malfunction.
'I had a really serious malfunction,' she laughed. 'I lived part of the time in San Diego when my partner, who had been the President of Warner Bros worldwide, decided to retire.
'I went to this very grand ball. It was when I was doing very exotic crinolines and the top was all woven in ribbons and there was a big crinoline skirt.
'No sooner had I nearly got up to dance, than the whole of the zip went all the way down the back. Luckily I had a magical shawl.
'But I then had to say, "We're going to have to leave this very early and walk out backwards," because there was no way I could even hold the bodice.
'It was already flapping at the front. I just had to say, "Walk out very closely behind me and we'll go out the side of the room".'

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just like her big brother Prince George, Princess Charlotte's personality shines through every time she makes a new appearance. The young princess and professional bridesmaid has definitely mastered the perfect princess wave, but she's just as likely to poke her tongue out or tease photographers as she is to pose for the perfect portrait . . . after all, royal or not, she's just a kid!
The young royal can't hide what she's thinking, whether she's overjoyed at a polo match or overtired at Trooping the Colour. We've been lucky enough to witness many of Charlotte's sweet moments as she's gained confidence and begun to really ham it up when she spots royal photographers, flashing smirks, and poking out her tongue in the grand tradition of second-born royals we've come to know and love (we're looking at you, Princess Margaret, Princess Anne, and Prince Harry). Keep reading for a look back at some of Charlotte's most memorable facial expressions!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Anushka Sharma: One Of The Underrated Style Icons Of Bollywood- A Quick Quarantine Saturday Read</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ever seen closely how Anushka Sharma carries herself? Followed her style mantra? If not, then this would be an ideal piece to read on a locked down Saturday!
I once asked singer Kanika Kapoor (Yes, the one who has become more famous for her COVID-19 case than Baby Doll Main Sone Di) during one of our chats on fashion and style, that who according to her is the most underrated actress when it comes to vogue, and she named Anushka Sharma.
Indeed, she is. Anushka Sharma's styling is carefree, effortless and very you and me. During travel, you will not see her dress up for an 'Airport Look', while chilling with her husband at home, you will not see her dressed because the picture will go on social media. On red caprets, you will not see her attempt a look because it's in trend or because she has to make a statement. 
Anushka is fierce when it comes to donning what she feels like wearing at that moment. Most of her red carpet outfits have always landed in my Best Dressed list and guess what? I realised that while writing this piece- anymore example of the actress' understated fashion icon image? 
As someone who likes to follow fashion and trends, names like Deepika Padukone, Sonam Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, pop up high on my list of fashionistas, however, if you ask me about relatable styling, Anushka Sharma and Alia Bhatt are two names which top that list.
Yes, Anushka does have her own brand of clothes, Nush, yet the actress has never presented herself as the epitome of vogue. Wonder if that's got to do with the many other roles she plays in her real life- an actor, producer, wife, animal welfare woker. 
Nonetheless, when you think of Fashion icons from Bollywood, trust this lady's name to be there for sure because Anushka has made a mark for herself in the segment quietly but strongly!

A post shared by Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) on May 2, 2020 at 6:43pm PDT
Demi Lovato is perfecting the art of self-timer photo shoots while social distancing, and her series of swimsuit snaps show just how good she's getting. The "I Love Me" singer recently shared pictures of herself wearing a romantic one-piece on Instagram, and it's more elegant than you'd expect from everyday swimwear.
The strapless ruched magenta suit is so chic it might cause you to do a double take. It certainly caught the attention of her pals, Ashley Graham and JoJo, along with her boyfriend, Max Ehrich, who responded with a heart-eyes emoji. I think Ashley put it best when she wrote, "My girl is straight fire 🔥" — Demi certainly is! Continue admiring her one-piece ahead, and shop similar swimsuit styles for yourself.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Demi Lovato Goes Makeup-Free for Swimsuit Selfies</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Demi Lovato seems to be spending her weekend in one of the best ways possible — by hanging out poolside. On Saturday, the singer posted a couple of photos on Instagram in which she donned a makeup-free look whilst donning a swimsuit. And, of course, the snaps were nothing short of stunning.
In her caption, Lovato related that she learned how to use the self-timer feature in order to capture her selfies. She got to put her new skill to use as she posed in a crimson swimsuit for a couple of seriously stylish and beautiful snaps. The "Cool for the Summer" singer's post has already garnered plenty of reactions from fans and friends alike. Model Ashley Graham even commented on the post to write, "my girl is straight fire," and she's definitely not wrong.
This isn't the first time that Lovato has chosen to go a makeup-free route on Instagram. In September 2019, the singer took things a step further by posting a completely unedited photo of herself wearing a bikini. At the time, she noted that she wanted to post the photo because she wants the new chapter in her life to be an authentic one.
"This is my biggest fear. A photo of me in a bikini unedited. And guess what, it’s CELLULIT!!!! I’m just literally sooooo tired of being ashamed of my body, editing it (yes the other bikini pics were edited - and I hate that I did that but it’s the truth) so that others think I’m THEIR idea of what beautiful is, but it’s just not me," she explained. "This is what I got. I want this new chapter in my life to be about being authentic to who I am rather than trying to meet someone else’s standards. So here’s me, unashamed, unafraid and proud to own a body that has fought through so much and will continue to amaze me when I hopefully give birth one day." As she continued on in her caption, she hoped that by posting the snap that she can inspire others to be authentically themselves, as well.
"Anyway, here’s me, RAW, REAL! And I love me," Lovato continued. "And you should love you too! Now back to the studio.. I’m working on an anthem.. also. Just so everyone’s clear.. I’m not stoked on my appearance BUT I am appreciative of it and sometimes that’s the best I can do. I hope to inspire someone to appreciate their body today too."

The actress shared an eye-catching photo of herself smiling and posing in a green bikini while going for a morning swim and in it, she looked fantastic. She also wore sunglasses and jewelry, including hoop earrings and a necklace in the snapshot and used the caption for the photo to give a shout-out to her mom for her birthday. “Morning lap swim! Happy Birthday Mom! 💙” the caption read. The blonde beauty also shared a few pics from her lap to her Instagram story and left a caption that advised her followers by writing “don’t forget your flotation devices.”
It didn’t take long for fans to leave positive comments on January’s pic once she posted it. “Truly a beautiful woman 💙💚” one follower wrote while another agreed by writing “beautiful picture of you.” Others simply said, “Wow” and exclaimed that she is “so pretty!”
This isn’t the first time January stunned in something green. Who could forget her amazing green jumpsuit at the 2015 Emmy Awards? The epic fashion choice was strapless and helped her show off her slim figure on the red carpet. She also looks great in other colors too like red, which she showed off when she wore a red dress in some pics she posted to Instagram in Dec. 2019. The dress included a plunging neckline with a lacy lining, a fitted waist and a draping skirt bottom.
Since we’re used to being impressed by January’s awesome fashion sense and fitting figure, her latest photos are no surprise and we hope to see more soon. It’s great to know she’s staying healthy and active in quarantine!

    <h5 class="mb-1">11 celebrities who have reached for hair dye while they’re bored at home</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Though they might not have access to hairstylists and makeup artists while they practice social distancing, celebrities are still finding ways to experiment with their looks.
One of the most popular methods seems to be through hair dye. In recent weeks, celebrities including Ricky Martin, Hilary Duff, and Dua Lipa have all taken to Instagram with photos of themselves wearing bright new styles. Coincidentally, almost every star that’s done so has chosen either a pink or blue shade.
Here are some of the celebrities taking part in Hollywood’s latest beauty trend.
He showed off his newly-pink hair in an Instagram video about the importance of social distancing posted on March 19.
“This quarantine’s got me feeling extra blue,” the country star wrote in an Instagram post on March 19. “Probably gonna stay that way teal it’s over.”
Though she still had blue hair in an Instagram video posted on April 10, she now seems to be back to her natural blonde shade.
In an Instagram post on April 8, the actor wrote: “Today I will be channeling Sir Woody of the woodpeckers #woodywoodpecker #redhairdontcare.”
She revealed the color via her Instagram Story on March 25. While it’s unclear as to what color her hair is now, Fanning’s strands did look significantly less pink in a photo she posted on April 13.
On March 29, Stewart’s hairstylist CJ Romero shared a photo of her new color, writing: “Who said you can’t be cute in quarantine!? ????????‍♂️Hair cut on @emmaroberts and Cut and Color on Kristen!! ????????‍♀️????????‍♂️????????.”
He later shared more details about how to achieve her bright-orange hair, which he describes as being a “cosmic rust” color.
“The smile of a girl who just did at-home hot-pink highlights because what else can I do right now!” she wrote in an Instagram post on April 1. “Thanks @limecrimemakeup, these hair conditioners are easy and so fun! @nikkilee901 don’t be mad lol. I really miss you! Hey @911onfox, new look for Maddie?!”
On April 4, the model and actress wrote about experimenting with box-dye on Instagram.
“I added some pink in my hair and it was my first box-dye experience and I didn’t fry my hair off weeeeehooooo,” she wrote.
She shared a photo of her new style and color to Instagram on April 12, writing: “????????‍♀️yea.” She later appeared on a live Instagram video with her husband Matthew Koma, who took credit for dyeing her hair.
She also wrote about her new color on Instagram as part of a “Quarantine diaries” entry on April 16.
“This week’s experiment… pink hair,” she wrote. “That’s kind of it really – I haven’t acquired a new skill but I have joined World of Warcraft and I have two pets on it called mintsaws and little sheena (one’s a dragonhawk and one’s a tiger).”
Lipa revealed her new color through Instagram on April 26. In the caption of her post, she called her new shade “orangina quarantina ????.”
On Instagram, she said she’d wear the temporary dye until it washes out.
“Well, because we’re still in quarantine, I had to think of a new and creative way to embarrass my children,” she said in her video on April 28. “Quarancolor!”
In an Instagram post on May 1, the actress wrote: “What can I say!? Sometimes you just need to feel blue and other times you need pink to lighten your day.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Demi Lovato Stuns In Sultry Pool Pics And Her Man Is Loving It!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Demi Lovato is taking advantage of the free time she has because of the quarantine orders to learn new skills including how to use the self timer on her phone and take steamy pool pics! She shared a couple of snaps on her Instagram and it’s safe to say that her boyfriend, Max Ehrich was impressed and so were her followers!
Demi looked stunning and sultry with no makeup on and wearing a strapless one piece swimsuit while she posed by the pool.
In the caption, she jokingly wrote: ‘Swipe to see how I discovered the self-timer feature for taking pics. @angelokritikos [her photographer] – you in trouble boo boo 😝🌴.’
The photographer was quick to respond, playing along: ‘BRING IT ON BOO 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 😍😍😍😍.’
In the meantime, her boyfriend also took to the comment section to show her some love by simply leaving a heart-eyes emoji!
Fellow celebs gushed over Demi as well, including Ashley Graham and JoJo.
Demi and her new man haven’t been together for very long but they already seem like they have a great bond.
One insider dished that they really love spending time together so the joint quarantine is no problem.
Speaking of relationships, during an interview on the I Weigh podcast with actress Jameela Jamil, Demi revealed that she is not in touch with any of her ex boyfriends.
‘I kind of used to have this mentality that if I had a negative experience with somebody, I needed to mend it or needed to make things right. The fact of the matter is that I’m not really friends with any of my exes because I had to realize that that was not healthy either.’
‘Now that I have been able to fully let go of people, that is another thing I had to learn when it comes to cutting the toxic people out of your life – if they are an ex, it is for a reason,’ she dished.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Has Adele shaved all her hair off in new picture?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Singer Adele is the last person we would expect to join the shaved head lockdown trend — but the British songstress would seemingly outdo just about everyone with a new buzzed ‘do.
A picture of the ‘Someone Like You’ artist went viral. In it, her head is shaved and what’s left of her short hair is dyed blonde.
The image landed online after Adele’s make-up artist shared a cryptic post telling everyone to ‘get ready’ and revealed that ‘exciting news [is] coming soon’, leading people to believe that a new album was on the way.
Soon after, the picture of Adele made its way onto Twitter with the caption ‘ADELE?!!!!’
“This album is about to send us all to therapy,” was the caption of a viral retweet, which has 245 million likes and more than 57 thousand retweets.
A quick visit to the verified Instagram (@hey_reilly) that shared the photo shows that its specialised in edited celebrity photos.
In fact, the illustrator and graphic artist has in the past digitally shaven off Timothee Chalamet’s locks, given president Barack Obama a footballer-worthy leopard dye job, and turned Queen Eilzabeth into an avant-garde editorial titled ‘Elizabeth McQueen’.
So, who is @hey_reilly?
Tagging his photos with H_R, @hey_reilly is a Scottish-born digital artist, who graduated from the Royal College of Art, and is known for putting a tongue-in-cheek twist on pop culture images.
He has more than 169 thousand followers and is verified on Instagram.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner names daughter Stormi her greatest achievement with adorable poolside snap</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Billionaire Kylie Jenner has named what she considers he greatest achievement - her daughter Stormi.
The reality star and makeup mogul shares the two year old with ex and rapper Travis Scott, and paid tribute to her beautiful girl with a cute snap by the pool.
Stormi has a mischievous grin on her face as doting mum Kylie wraps a towel about her head to dry her curls.
"The greatest thing I've ever done," Kylie captioned the snap.
Pals and fans alike were quick to gush over the iconic mother-daughter duo.
Malika Haqq, the best mate of Kylie's sister Khloe Kardashian and fellow mum, wrote: "Stop the cuteness!"
Kylie's bestie Anastasia Karanikolaou commented: "sweeeeeeetest baby girl."
Yris Palmer, meanwhile, just shared a string of heart emojis.
Kylie's had a hell of a year already, not least because she was named by Forbes, at the age of 22, as the world's youngest billionaire for the second year running.
She's had fans tongue-wagging recently with a declaration of love for Stormi's dad Travis - the pair aren't together, but a loving Instagram post for his birthday has some hopeful that a reunion might be on the cards.
"DADA," she wrote, "Happy birthday to daddy of the year!
"I'm slowly but surely starting to accept the fact that Storm is a daddy's girl. But whatever. We went half on greatness!
"The most beautiful, smart, funny and loving little baby. The best gift.
"OK I'm crying. Love you forever! @travisscott."
The pair announced they would be taking a break from their relationship late last year - and while no romantic rekindling has been confirmed, they've successfully co-parented Stormi.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pooja Hegde’s Instagram feed shows her latest uploads had been basic; just a cooking pic, pics of her quarantine life and of course, while she is reading something. She didn’t share fitness videos like many actresses out there.
The onset of corona pandemic created a void for the working women, especially actresses who started sharing some fitness Gyan along with their workout videos on fitness and health.
Pooja thinks that she isn’t much qualified to post something about fitness and regardless, there have been enough fitness videos from others. It seems as if she is taking a dig at others as our heroines aka Rakul Preet Singh has totally been into uploading workout videos and pics, regularly.
Like others, she isn’t into preaching and again she says, there are many out there who have already been doing it. Looks like a clear dig at someone. Got it!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Georgina has done it again. Cristiano Ronaldo's girlfriend has set social media alight by showing her behind whilst doing a daily task: hanging up washing.
Well yes, it seems that Georgina Rodríguez's buttock workouts are working. Cristiano's partner does not miss her routines to reggaetón music, either alone or in the company of the forward or one of her children, and the result is obvious. 
That the model lights up social media now isn't news, with her famous exercises or with revealing photographs in a bikini, but she has done it again and this time she surprised again, because of her clothes... or rather, lack of them.
And it's not easy to get more than 2.7 million likes on Instagram with a post doing something as routine as hanging up the washing, but if you are Georgina and do it in a thong then things change.

"Airborne wipes" Ronaldo's girlfriend wrote, who boasted an enviable figure and buttocks, along with a peach and bomb emoji.
On Saturday, the model made the most of the sunny day to go to the mountains with Ronaldo and the players' eldest son, Cristiano Jr and put it on her Instagram the same as the forward.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
January revealed that she was going for a morning swim.
January Jones kicked off the weekend by flaunting her fit figure in a chic bikini. However, when she shared a photo of her stylish swimwear with her 985,000 Instagram followers, the caption she included with it had a few of her followers scratching their heads.
The 42-year-old Mad Men star wished her mother, Karen, a happy birthday. She also wrote that she was participating in a “morning lap swim” when her photo was taken. The latter revelation led to one of January’s followers making an observation about the array of accessories she was wearing with her two-piece. The actress was rocking a gold medallion necklace with a thick chain, a pair of large textured gold hoop earrings, and retro cat-eye sunglasses with metallic frames and dark lenses.
“Lap swim with necklace, earrings and sunglasses?” the seemingly skeptical commenter wrote.
“Gold doesn’t rust. and it was more a water aerobics situation,” January explained.
The teal swimsuit that January chose for her workout featured a halter neck design with adjustable sliding cups. A small panel of aqua fabric looped around the top of the bikini’s thick halter strap. The string underneath the bust was also the light cyan shade, and the entire bathing suit was trimmed with the color.
January was wearing the cups of her bikini top scrunched inwards to expose a generous amount of her ample cleavage, including more than a hint of sideboob spillage. She was standing in chest-deep water, but, because it was crystal-clear, the bottom half of her bathing suit was still visible. January was wearing a pair of high-waisted briefs that hit her right below the bellybutton. The bottoms had wide sides with low-cut leg openings that showed off her athletic thighs and a hint of her pert posterior. Her two-piece also showcased her trim waist and flat stomach.
The actress was wearing her chin-length blond hair loosely pulled back. Her pale skin was flawless, and her lips were a soft, natural shade of pink. She was flashing a big smile at the camera as she held her arms out to the sides.
Over the span of an hour, January’s morning workout photo racked up over 47,000 likes. Her followers also flocked to the comments section to share their thoughts about the snapshot.
“I’m relieved to see you using flotation devices…” read a popular response from actor Will Kemp.
“Hold up, my jaw fell, have to go back an pick it up,” another commenter wrote.
“Wow!!!!!!! You just made me take a deep breath. Flawless,” a third Instagrammer remarked.
The X-Men: First Class star isn’t the only stunning blond celebrity who has left her fans awestruck by flaunting her bikini body on Instagram. As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Jessica Simpson treated her followers to a sizzling swimsuit snap that also received rave reviews.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner Reveals The Best Thing She Has Ever Done, But Some Fans Say Travis Scott Deserves Most Of The Credit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kylie Jenner has touched fans with her grace and gratitude. Travis Scott’s baby mama won her followers this week when she revealed the best thing she ever did in life.
The business mogul made the revelation when she posted a photo of daughter Stormi Webster Friday.
One commenter stated: “Who… done what..!!! Sorry but this’s all travis work you were the egg just you carried her so….. thank you.”
A second observer replied: “You clearly don’t know how much work it is to carry a baby in your body for 9 months.”
A third follower added: “Technically the best thing you ever did was her daddy cuz you had to do him in order to get her😂 but look at those cute curls OMG 🥰.”
Kylie has a lot of reasons to simile in addition to baby Stormi, she just bought a huge mansion in California.
According to recent reports, Kylie has just expanded her real estate empire with a new impressive home in the worth of $36.5 million.
The makeup mogul also owns a house in Hidden Hills, which she bought back in 2016 for $12 million and an investment property in Beverly Hills for $13 million that she shares with the father of her child, Travis.
The luxurious estate is situated in the prestigious neighborhood in Holmby Hills and is spanning over 15,000 square feet and offers seven bedrooms and 14 bathrooms. Also, the property has various bars, games rooms, a sports area, and a professionally equipped kitchen.
The mansion, which was labeled as a “resort compound,” is also said to offer immaculate security with its 24/7 guardhouse, as privacy must be important for Kylie, who is the youngest self-made billionaire.
Even though the initial price of the property was $45 million, the younger sister of Kim Kardashian got a lucrative discount by the previous owner, who reportedly has collaborated professionally with Kylie in the past.
For the time being, it remains unknown if Kylie is going to live full-time in her new estate, or she will continue to be situated in her current main house in Hidden Hills.
Meanwhile, it was reported that now Kylie was not the only billionaire in her family as, according to Forbes, the net worth of Jenner’s brother-in-law, Kanye West, is about $1.26 billion.
However, according to West, his fortune was much more than that and stated that he had $3.3 billion.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner sends fans wild with incredible bum snap as she models stylish co-ords at home in LA</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KYLIE Jenner sent fans wild yesterday as she showed off her famous bum in a stunning Instagram snap.
The entrepreneur emphasised her curves with a powerful pose in her LA garden as she modelled a stylish two piece that showed off her tum.
She played down her makeup for a more natural look and gave the camera a sultry stare.
The compliments flooded in, with one writing: "Looking like a SNACK 😋❤️🍧🍰."
Another said: "Such a vibe."
While a third wrote: "yes ma’am KYLIE😍😍."
It came as Kylie revealed she's scared after someone close to her tested positive for coronavirus.
"It's scary when it's someone so close to home...HAS tested positive," she said in a teaser for the September return of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.
The beauty appeared to have filmed the confessional herself, as the Kar-Jenner clan are seen locking down as the coronavirus pandemic breaks out.
Kylie has been locked down with her daughter Stormi, Stormi's dad Travis Scott and her bff Stassi, during the stay at home order.
It's likely she's referring to one of the first diagnosed cases of coronavirus on March 6, which was a father and his two sons who returned from a ski-trip in Italy and lived nearby to her Calabasas home.
The season 18 mid-season trailer, documents the coronavirus shut down affecting the famous family.
As a sound bite from Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is heard, announcing the city's stay-at-home order, the family is shown doing exactly what the rest of the country currently is also doing: nothing.
Kim Kardashian appears to says she has directly spoke to the White House to discuss the virus, as she explained they have told her it's "serious."
The mother-of-four documents the madness of trying to homeschool her kids,.
Momager Kris Jenner is seen wearing a mask, and getting particularly emotional during a phone call with Khloe.
"I wish I could hug you," she tells her.
Khloe kept her energy up with a dance party indoors with True Thompson.
While, Scott Disick joked that he's going "stir crazy," during the sneak peek.
While video conferencing with Kim, Khloe and Kris, Scott asks the question on everyone's lips - whether or not Khloe has slept with her ex Tristan Thompson again.
"Oh, 100 percent," Kim replied.
"That's what I said!" Scott said, "She says no."
There was plenty more tensions caught on camera before filming was halted, as things still appear to be difficult between Khloe and Kourtney.
"You and Khlo seem disconnected," Scott said to Kourtney after Khloe tells her she's "not participating" with the rest of them.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">If there’s anyone who knows how to start a weekend on the right note, it is Bollywood star Shahid Kapoor’s wife Mira Rajput. She has taken to her social media handle to share her good hair day selfie, which believe it or not is every girl’s dream.
In the click, Meera can be seen looking right into the lens while her silky hair falling freely and beautifully. She is wearing a multi-hued top and her face is looking fresh as a daisy with minimum make up and natural glow.
Check out the picture here:
Mira is one of the most active celebs on social media. Just two days back she shared a very beautiful post giving a shout out to the kids staying indoors. The mother of two applauded for all the children who are showing their patience and staying at home. She called them little heroes. Sharing the post, Meera wrote - “Love them. Hug them. Ask them how they feel and let them cry if they’re not okay. Kiss them. Paint with them and let their clothes and the walls get dirty. Watch their favourite cartoon with them. Snuggle up with them. Give them extra ketchup if they ask for it that day. And when you’re tired after doing the dishes and cooking dinner and they say “Mumma can you play with me” remember this time isn’t forever. Little hands. Big hearts. Love them.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meghan & Harry Will Reportedly Spill Some Royal Tea In A Tell-All Biography</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Could Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex soon spill some royal tea? Meghan and Harry reportedly granted an interview for an upcoming tell-all biography titled Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making Of A Modern Royal Family. According to a Deadline report published on May 3, Finding Freedom authors Omid Scobie, royal editor for Harper's Bazaar, and Carolyn Durand, royal contributor for Elle and O, The Oprah Magazine, reportedly interviewed Meghan and Harry prior to their move from the UK to Canada (and later, Los Angeles). Bustle has reached out to Meghan and Harry's rep for comment.
Finding Freedom, available on August 11, will go “beyond the headlines” and chronicle “unknown details” about Meghan and Harry’s life together, as well as dispel the “rumors and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond,” per the biography’s blurb on Amazon. With Scobie and Durand’s “unique access” and the “participation of those closest to the couple,” the biography promises an intimate portrait of the “confident, influential, and forward-thinking couple who are unafraid to break with tradition” and “determined to create a new path away from the spotlight.”
The reported interview will be one of the first since Meghan and Harry officially stepped down as senior members of the royal family in March. Since their relocation to Los Angeles with son Archie that same month, the two have been spotted out and about delivering groceries to families in need with charity Project Angel Food during the global health crisis, surgical masks and gloves in tow.
The tell-all would mark Meghan’s second project post-royal split. The duchess last narrated the Disney+ nature documentary Elephant, which follows a herd of resilient African elephants as they journey across the Kalahari Desert. In partnership with Elephants Without Borders, Disney donated Meghan's voiceover fees to the charity dedicated to wildlife conservation in Botswana.
“She was absolutely intrigued by the elephants, and transfixed, especially by the female empowerment side,” co-director Vanessa Berlowitz told PEOPLE of Meghan’s involvement in April. “How important the matriarchs are to the story; it really is all about female leadership. It’s a different form of power. She was absolutely fascinated by that.”
Since Elephant’s release, Meghan has also popped up in Zoom calls to chat with members of the UK’s Hubb Community Kitchen and to surprise a Smarts Work client before a job interview. As for what could be next for the Harry and Meghan, perhaps Finding Freedom will provide some insights.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Forget about the adorable elephant documentary, this is the juicy stuff we’ve been waiting for. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, who are now more than a month into their unceremonious exit from the British royal family, have reportedly cooperated with journalists who penned a tell-all biography about their new life. Deadline reports that Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family, written by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, secured an interview with the couple just before they left the United Kingdom for sunnier pastures in Canada (and now Los Angeles). The book, set for an August 20 release, is teased as going “beyond the headlines to reveal unknown details of Harry and Meghan’s life together,” in addition to getting participation “of those closest to the couple.” Our hearts say it’s a cooing baby Archie, but our minds say Meghan’s yogi momma.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Harry & Meghan Reportedly Agreed To Spicy Tell-All Bio & Somewhere, Lizzy Is Clenching</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, otherwise known as Harry and Meghan, have reportedly given their blessing to an upcoming royal biography about them. Deadline reports the couple even gave an interview to the book’s authors before they waved ta-ta to the UK.
Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of A Modern Royal Family was written by journalists Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, who have extensively covered the British Royal Family over the years.
“For the very first time, Finding Freedom goes beyond the headlines to reveal unknown details of Harry and Meghan’s life together, dispelling the many rumours and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond,” part of the synopsis on Amazon reads.
“With unique access and written with the participation of those closest to the couple, Finding Freedom is an honest, up-close, and disarming portrait of a confident, influential, and forward-thinking couple who are unafraid to break with tradition, determined to create a new path away from the spotlight, and dedicated to building a humanitarian legacy that will make a profound difference in the world.”
The biography will be released on August 11, you can suss out more details about it right here.
And then there’s the other book, the one called Kensington Palace: An Intimate Memoir From Queen Mary To Meghan Markle, which will be released in September. In an excerpt from the book published by the couple’s fave, the Daily Mail, anonymous sources told stories of Meghan’s behaviour in Kensington Palace. One source, a former servant, described an incident that contributed to the couple’s decision to split their household from William and Kate‘s. Apparently “Meghan shouted at a member of Kate’s staff”, which was “definitely the beginning of discussions about leaving Kensington Palace.” Other sources claimed Meghan was jealous of Kate, because “she is not married to the next king.” Bummer. The anonymous sources threw more of the same shit at Meghan, even adding that she was jealous that her former home, Frogmore Cottage in Windsor, was “tiny in comparison to the vast apartment complex where Kate and William live.”
In conclusion, it’s just another day on the royal beat.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Revealed: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's bombshell biography is called 'Finding Freedom' and promises an 'up-close portrait' of the 'confident' couple</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The name of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's bombshell biography has been revealed as Finding Freedom.
Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of A Modern Royal Family is set to be released worldwide online on August 11, with the hard copy on sale from August 20.
A description of the biography on Amazon promises to offer an 'honest, up-close, and disarming portrait' of the 'confident, influential, forward' Prince Harry, 35, and Meghan Markle, 38.
Last month, the Mail on Sunday reported that the Duke and Duchess had co-operated with Omid Scobie and Catherine Durand on the explosive new book that risks inflicting further anguish on the royal family.
Publishing house Harper Collins, which owns Dey Street Books, the publisher of the biography released a brief description of Meghan and Prince Harry's collaboration with the two journalists.
The book's description says that 'few know the true story of Harry and Meghan'. 
It promises to go 'beyond the headlines to reveal unknown details of Harry and Meghan's life together, dispelling the many rumours and misconceptions that plague the couple on both sides of the pond'.
It continues: 'With unique access and written with the participation of those closest to the couple, Finding Freedom is an honest, up-close, and disarming portrait of a confident, influential, and forward-thinking couple who are unafraid to break with tradition, determined to create a new path away from the spotlight, and dedicated to building a humanitarian legacy that will make a profound difference in the world.'
Meanwhile the cover features a beaming Prince Harry and Meghan as they visited their namesake county in October 2018 for the first time.
Palace insiders expect the biography to paint a flattering portrait of the couple. 
There are fears it will also be a score-settling exercise in which Harry and Meghan's strained relationship with the Royal Family and painful decision to quit Britain are revisited in uncomfortable detail.
The Mail on Sunday were told that before moving to North America, the privacy-obsessed Sussexes gave an interview to the book's authors, both journalists. 
One of them, Omid Scobie,is an acknowledged Meghan cheerleader and was one of the favoured journalists given details of the couple's video call to the Queen last week in which they wished her a happy 94th birthday. 
Echoing Princess Diana's secret involvement in the blockbuster biography, Diana: Her True Story, when she encouraged her friends to speak to author Andrew Morton, questions are being asked whether members of Meghan's inner circle were being urged to help Scobie and his American co-author, Carolyn Durand. 
The 320-page biography, due to be released in August, is expected to be a global bestseller.

The School of Life
Beautifully-produced clips containing essential wisdom and advice for these tough times.
Sam HarrisGuided meditations (without the woo-woo) from the best-selling author and philosopher.
Jansen’s DIYLearn how to make a room feel bigger and master the art of “lazy cleaning”.
That Mitchell & Mack CollectionNeed a laugh? These clips from British comedy show Would I Lie To You? will do the trick.
HASfitTerrific instructional exercise videos to help you stay healthy at home.
Shake it Off – Taylor Swift
At 160 beats per minute, this track is a perfect song to run on the treadmill to while using Taylor’s fantastic physique as your #fitspo.
Single Ladies – Beyonce
With little else to do in isolation, why not use the opportunity to learn the full choreography to Beyonce’s 2008 hit so you are performance ready when the clubs reopen.
Call on Me – Eryk Prydz
If full choreography isn’t for you, Call on Me offers 2.51 minute gym class that you can just watch on repeat until you feel fit.
Blinding Lights – The Weeknd
Bypass the official music video and find the complication of Tik Tok dances to craft the perfect workout to this '80s-like banger.
Brave – Sara Bareilles
This song should probably be our isolation anthem, but if you’re pushing through that 80th crunch, let Sara inspire you to get to 100.

INTERNATIONAL JAZZ DAY LIVE STREAM ★★★★
April 30
Reviewed by JOHN SHAND
International Jazz Day (April 30) has celebrated jazz's role in helping unite people the world over since 2011. This year, when the host nation was to have been South Africa, it was, instead, another reminder of a community splintered into an epidemic of isolation. But, thanks to a commendable collaboration between the Sydney Improvised Music Association and Johnston St Jazz, a 140-minute mini-festival occurred via two livestreams and one pre-recorded concert.
If the bands chosen could have more thoroughly reflected the sheer diversity of what passes for jazz, they were all able to bridge the livestream remoteness. Over half the time was allotted to the final act, the Jeremy Rose Quartet, with Rose having become a composer of note, especially via his major work, Iron in the Blood, which was included in the distant memory that is this year's Sydney Festival.
Although Rose's work for his quartet stays much closer to the jazz mainstream than does Iron in the Blood, he still finds fresh compositional ideas with which to prod the idiom and to stimulate improvising options. In the piano solo on the meditative Religion, for instance, Steve Barry could deploy all his capacity to tease, suspend or subvert the listener's expectations. The dark, edgy and aptly named Precipice began with solo bass from Noel Mason, which beckoned Rose's bass clarinet, the instrument on which he has developed his most distinctive voice and widest palette of colours. On the brilliantly evocative Aktau, Mason's bass seemed to convey the enormity of Kazakhstan's White Mountains, Rose's tenor the altitude, Barry's piano the crystalline air, and Alex Hirlian's drums the excitement.
The Mezza/Ginsburg Ensemble, a collaboration co-led by Italian pianist Vittorio Mezza and Australian pianist Mark Ginsburg (with bassist Karl Dunnicliff and drummer Tim Firth) was filmed at last year's Sydney Con International Jazz Festival, and suddenly it was novel to see an audience on hand! Dunnicliff produced notably fine solos on two of Ginsburg's pieces: the gentle For You and Common Purpose, the latter made lush with the addition of a substantial choir.
Vocalist Kate Wadey, pianist Andrew Scott and bassist Sam Dobson opened the celebration and, while Wadey's breathy, unforced singing was especially effective on I've Got a Crush on You, with the piano dancing behind her, the rest of the performance proved more uneven.

The dark, edgy and aptly named Precipice began with solo bass from Noel Mason, which beckoned Rose's bass clarinet, the instrument on which he has developed his most distinctive voice and widest palette of colours. On the brilliantly evocative Aktau, Mason's bass seemed to convey the enormity of Kazakhstan's White Mountains, Rose's tenor the altitude, Barry's piano the crystalline air, and Alex Hirlian's drums the excitement.
The Mezza/Ginsburg Ensemble, a collaboration co-led by Italian pianist Vittorio Mezza and Australian pianist Mark Ginsburg (with bassist Karl Dunnicliff and drummer Tim Firth) was filmed at last year's Sydney Con International Jazz Festival, and suddenly it was novel to see an audience on hand! Dunnicliff produced notably fine solos on two of Ginsburg's pieces: the gentle For You and Common Purpose, the latter made lush with the addition of a substantial choir.
Vocalist Kate Wadey, pianist Andrew Scott and bassist Sam Dobson opened the celebration and, while Wadey's breathy, unforced singing was especially effective on I've Got a Crush on You, with the piano dancing behind her, the rest of the performance proved more uneven.

    <h5 class="mb-1">There's nothing like a dame for easing the shutdown blues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Opera Australia has launched a free online streaming service featuring interviews and recordings of past productions, with a particular emphasis on the company’s vast collection of performances by the legendary Dame Joan Sutherland.
OATV launches today with a recording of 2012’s inaugural opera on Sydney Harbour performance of La Traviata plus a 1988 production of The Merry Widow with Sutherland as the eponymous Hanna Glawari.
Artistic director Lyndon Terracini said the project had been in the works for some time but that the virus-driven shutdown had accelerated development.
“Hopefully, people will feel it has a bit more substance than what you usually see online,” he said.
Terracini was personally devastated when the shutdown was announced.
"It was frankly extremely depressing,” he said. “I was a bit down for a few weeks and then I had to figure out what I was going to do so I started doing OATV and working on other projects to keep busy. If I’m not busy I get depressed and that's not good.”
Terracini said he felt for all the artists left high and dry by the crisis, particularly singers such as rising star Natalie Aroyan, who managed only two performances as Odabella in Verdi’s Attila and soprano Stacey Alleaume, who was to sing Violetta in La Traviata on the harbour stage this year.
But despite the uncertainly about when audiences will be allowed to return to the opera theatre, Terracini insisted Opera Australia continued to plan for the future.
"As far as we are concerned, we hope to be up and running before too long but having said that I think we all realise the world is going to be a very different place.”
He likened the current situation to that in 2009, when he first took the reins of OA in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.
“The company was in a pretty terrible state and we had to do things differently,” he said. “I introduced Handa Opera on Sydney Harbour, the musicals and a different sort of repertoire. Last year and 2018 were unbelievably successful years for the company and were the culmination of 10 years’ work but now we will have to start again. That's all gone.
“It’s a depressing and daunting task but that's the way it is. It’s happened and we can’t do anything about that. We will just have to be more creative and think about who and what we are going to be from next year on.”
Terracini also dropped his strongest hint yet that this year’s much anticipated La Traviata, which was to have opened on the harbour on March 27, will be shifted to 2021.
“Let’s just say I wouldn’t want Stacey [Alleaume] or Con [director Constantine Costi] or any of the other artists who have worked so hard on Traviata for this year not to be given a chance to do it,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Keith Lemon breaks silence as Holly Willoughby quits Celebrity Juice</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Keith Lemon has broken his silence following the news that Holly Willoughby has quit Celebrity Juice after 12 years.
The comedian paid tribute to his former team captain shortly after she confirmed that was stepping down from the ITV panel show in a lengthy statement, and shared a heartfelt video of all their best bits and photographs together.
Alongside the clip, Keith wrote: ‘Goodbye @hollywilloughby.
‘I’ve had a lovely time working with you. You are the best! I hope I’m lucky enough to work with you again one day.
‘If I don’t see ya through the week I’ll see ya through the window. Big hugs KL x’
Holly announced her departure from the series hours after rumours had circulated that she had quit.
‘Thank you Celebrity Juice for 12 years of fantastic chaos… I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone,’ she penned.
‘ Thank you to you all for watching..we’ve always had the loudest and best audiences.
‘Also a huge thank you to ITV2 for believing in the show in the first place and for all of your support…Over the years the production team has changed, however to anyone lucky enough to have worked on the show, they will know that we really do have the best time, it’s never felt like work and always been to me like a night out..’
Holly went on to add: ‘Thank you for making me laugh for twelve years… I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check… if I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after… know you are always in my heart..’
It’s not yet been confirmed who will be replacing Holly on the show, but Our Girl star Michelle Keegan is currently the bookies favourite.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby's heartfelt message as she quits Celebrity Juice</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby's paid an emotional tribute to her co-stars and fans as she quit Celebrity Juice.
The This Morning star has been a team captain on the ITV2 show - which is fronted by Keith Lemon - since it started more than 12 years ago.
Holly, 39, said in her announcement on Instagram that "all good things must come to an end" and that "nothing lasts for ever."
Alongside a collage of photos from her time on the panel show, she wrote to her 6.6m followers: "Thank you @celebjuiceofficial for 12 years of fantastic chaos...
"I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone.
"Thank you to you all for watching..we’ve always had the loudest and best audiences."
The mum-of-three goes on to say: "It's never felt like work and always been to me like a night out... Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work... all good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever...
"It's time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky lucky person... whoever that is, know you are about to get one of the best jobs in telly working with one of comedies finest... @keithlemon ..."
Paying tribute to the show's host she continued: "Where to begin... I remember starting this journey with you and saying ‘I think this might work’... my goodness me it did... three friends, you me and @fearnecotton ... and that is what is at the heart of it.. friendship... I love the bones of you Lemon!
"Thank you for making me laugh for twelve years... I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check...
"If I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after... know you are always in my heart...," she ended the post in a nod to Keith's show phrase.
Fearne Cotton, 38, quit the long-running series back in 2018.
Keith responded to the post: "I’m in tears x"
And fans are gutted she's leaving the chaotic show too.
"Won't be the same without you Holly," one said.
Another commented: "Always loved the show! Not been the same without Fearne and will be even worse without you Holly."
"Noooooooooooooooo this can’t be won’t be the same," echoed a third.
Keith had already paid tribute to Holly before her announcement with a rather sweary video clip that he shared on Instagram.
In the short clip, Keith is seen reacting in shock as Holly screamed “F***!” at the camera.
He captioned the video: "Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in. One of the boys but all woman.
"A wicked sense of humour and very easy to look at. Don't look into her eyes though, cos she can make you do anything. What a lady!"
He added: "The one and only @hollywilloughby face of an angel but can have the potty mouth of... well me I guess."

She follows former co-stars Fearne Cotton and Rufus Hound who have also left in recent years, while Keith is the only original cast member remaining.
Keith took to social media to say goodbye to his close friend after her decision was made public.
He wrote: "I’ve had a lovely time working with you. You are the best! I hope I’m lucky enough to work with you again one day. Goodbye @hollywills x."
Now, he appears to have confirmed that Holly's final Celebrity Juice has been filmed.
The show has been recorded differently this series due to the coronavirus lockdown, and studio filmed episodes halting in March.
The team including new panellist Mel B all returned and filmed the show from their homes to meet social distancing rules, and the last episodes of the series are filmed in the same way.
As fans took to Twitter to share their sadness, many asked Keith about whether there would be a goodbye show for Holly.
One viewer told him directly: "Keith we need a goodbye show..best bits...cakie..ect ect ect..x."
Keith replied, confirming it was already filmed - while later tweeting to another fan that there weren't many episodes left in the current series.
He said: "Filmed it already. Shame it was whilst lockdown was happening. No hugs."
Keith later tweeted: "One more juice next week then a comp show then that’s it."
While many viewers fear this is the end of the show, Keith appeared to suggest otherwise as he continued to tweet as though the show will go on without Holly - amid speculation Michelle Keegan may replace her.
Keith was also forced to remind people Holly was quitting the show and not TV in general, while Holly herself revealed she would return for appearances on the series.
He said: "Don’t worry you’ll get more Holly. She isn’t stopping telly Just not on celeb juice anymore. Sad times."
Meanwhile, Holly revealed: "I'll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check... if I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after... know you are always in my heart."
Celebrity Juice continues on Thursday at 10pm on ITV2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby says ‘all good things come to an end’ as she pays tribute to Keith Lemon after quitting Celebrity Juice</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HOLLY Willoughby has paid a heartfelt tribute to Celebrity Juice and its host Keith Lemon after quitting the show.
The TV star shared a collection of her best times with Keith on Instagram and wrote how "all good things must come to an end".
She said: "Thank you @celebjuiceofficial for 12 years of fantastic chaos... I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone.
"Thank you to you all for watching.. we’ve always had the loudest and best audiences.
"...it’s never felt like work and always been to me like a night out... Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work... all good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever...
Holly told her yet to be named successor they were in for an incredible time.
She continued: "It’s time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky lucky person... whoever that is, know you are about to get one of the best jobs in telly working with one of comedies finest... @keithlemon ...
"Where to begin... I remember starting this journey with you and saying ‘I think this might work’... my goodness me it did... three friends, you me and @fearnecotton ... and that is what is at the heart of it.. friendship...
"I love the bones of you Lemon! Thank you for making me laugh for twelve years... I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check... if I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after... know you are always in my heart... ❤️."
Last night The Sun exclusively revealed quit the comedy game show after 12 years.
The TV presenter, 39, who has three children with her producer husband Dan Baldwin, 45, wants to spend more time with her family.
Holly told the ITV2 show’s producers about her decision last week after filming several lockdown editions with host Leigh Francis, 47.
Since launching the panel series in 2008 Holly — mum to Harry, ten, Belle, eight, and Chester, five — has become one of the UK’s most successful female TV presenters.
She fronts ITV daytime show This Morning, alongside Phillip Schofield, 58, and filled in for Ant McPartlin, 44, two years ago on I’m A Celebrity . . . Get Me Out Of Here.
Holly’s decision to quit Celebrity Juice comes after pal and fellow panellist Fearne Cotton, 38, left the series in 2018 to focus on new projects.
A TV source said: “Holly has absolutely loved her time on the show — it’s been a huge part of her life, and has really helped to expand her fanbase over the years.
“But she feels now is the right time to bow out and wants to free up a bit more of her busy schedule to spend with her family.
“She’s still the best of pals with Leigh Francis and will continue to support the series.”
Yesterday comic Leigh posted a touching tribute to the star on his alias Keith Lemon’s Instagram page.
He wrote: “Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in.
“One of the boys but all woman. A wicked sense of humour and very easy to look at.
“Don’t look into her eyes though, ’cos she can make you do anything. What a lady! King of the ladies!
“The queen of the milk beasts! The one and only @hollywilloughby face of an angel but can have the potty mouth of . . . well me I guess.
"Super rad! Super nice! My mate!
“I salute all your wonderfulness. Massive hugs.”
Holly replied: “Aww . . .  what a lovely thing to say . . .  love you Lemon.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lucy Mecklenburgh breastfeeds baby Roman as Ryan Thomas makes her breakfast in bed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LUCY Mecklenburgh shared an adorable snap of her breastfeeding baby son Roman today as fiancé Ryan Thomas treated her to breakfast in bed.
Cradling her son in her arms, makeup Lucy smiled while sitting with banana pancakes on her lap.
She shared the pic on Instagram and wrote: "HAPPY SUNDAY!! Roman’s breakfast first then tired Mummas."
Her followers praised Ryan for rustling up brekkie, with one writing: "You are spoilt by all these lovely breakfasts! I was lucky if I got a cup of tea!!!! 😘😘😘."
The actor recently hailed Lucy a “supermum” after their first baby together was born in isolation.
The Manchester-born star admitted they have found it challenging since son Roman’s arrival last month as they haven’t been able to call on family for support.
Normally Ryan, 35, would be celebrating the new addition with his brothers — former Emmerdale actor Adam, 31, and his twin, Love Island’s Scott — and their parents Dougie James and Gail Waring.
But the pandemic has forced Ryan and ex-Towie regular Lucy, 28, to isolate alone at their home in Essex.
It also meant Ryan’s 11-year-old daughter Scarlett — who he co-parents with his ex, Coronation street actress Tina O’Brien, 36 — had to wait a few weeks before meeting her baby brother.
Ryan, who played Corrie’s Jason Grimshaw for 16 years until 2016, revealed: “Lucy has been a supermum.
“There is no rule book about being a mother and I think it has been a day-to-day challenge and she has dealt with it all amazingly, I’m super proud of her.”
Ryan plans to have a big party in Manchester with his family as soon as the Government advises it is safe to do so.
He said: “It’s been difficult having the new baby and not being with the boys, it’s just not a normal situation.
“The first thing we do when our kids are born is show them off to the brothers. But we’ve been keeping touch and FaceTime a lot.
“My daughter is sharing her time between me and her mum. She’s gone home today and then she’ll be back next week or the week after.”
Ryan joked that he wants to recreate the iconic scene from Disney’s Lion King when monkey Rafiki presents newborn Simba to the Pride Rock animals.
He said: “Hopefully this all dies down and I can drive him home to Manchester and give him the whole Lion King experience.”
Lucy told fans on Instagram that Ryan is proving himself to be a proactive dad, mucking in with night feeds and when she is busy running her fitness and nutrition website.
She met Ryan three years ago, when they both appeared on Channel 4’s Celebrity Island With Bear Grylls. Lucy said of motherhood: “I’m good. Some days are hard, but Ryan has been so supportive and hands-on it’s helped me so much.
“It’s not always easy getting him to sleep but white noise is a lifesaver.”
The birth came after Ryan took to social media to describe the “fear and loneliness” of bringing a baby into the world while in lockdown.
It inspired the kind-hearted actor to offer nappies, babygrows and formula to parents who are struggling financially.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lucy Mecklenburgh breastfeeds son Roman before tucking in to breakfast in bed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Television star Lucy Mecklenburgh has been snapped breastfeeding her baby son before breakfast in bed today.
The former The Only Way Is Essex star, 28, gave birth to son Roman in March with her fiancé Ryan Thomas.
Lucy became engaged to the former Coronation Street actor in June last year after they began dating in 2017.
Ryan already has a daughter named Scarlett with his former Corrie co-star Tina O'Brien.
Now, Lucy has posted an image of her ideal Sunday morning - breastfeeding adorable Roman and getting breakfast served to her in bed by his daddy Ryan.
Sharing the delightful image with her Instagram followers, Lucy looks gorgeous and is a glowing new mother accompanied by some yummy-looking pancakes.
She captioned the image: "HAPPY SUNDAY!! Roman’s breakfast first then tired Mummas' #stayhome #staysafe #breakfastinbed #mumlife #nomakeup #pancakes"
Her openness with the natural routine of breastfeeding was praised by her fans in the comments section.
One of Lucy's followers replied to the post: "Love how open you’re being with motherhood and breastfeeding."
Another joked: "The art of picking at your food when babe is feeding.
"Did you even breastfeed if you didn’t end up with crumbs on your babe's head?"
A different fan of Lucy's commented: "Awwww love this! You’re doing amazingly mama!"
Sadly, Ryan is facing time away from his brothers Adam and Scott due to the coronavirus pandemic.
He recently revealed on This Morning: "The toughest thing of all is my brothers haven't even met my son yet and I can't wait..."
We're sure they'll love him when they meet him!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lucy Mecklenburgh breastfeeds baby Roman with breakfast in bed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lucy Mecklenburgh had a perfectly lazy Sunday morning as she breastfed her baby boy Roman before devouring breakfast in bed. 
The former Towie star gave her social media followers a glimpse into her new morning routine after she and fiance Ryan Thomas welcomed their son Roman two months ago. 
And it’s looking a little different these days with feeding Roman obviously the priority first thing on a Sunday morning. 
Lucy, 28, shared a photo of herself smiling at the camera while breastfeeding her baby boy with a breakfast tray in front of her. 
It looks as though Ryan, 35, prepared the most deliciously sweet brekkie including banana pancakes drizzled with chocolate syrup and a cup of coffee in a mug with ‘mummy’ on it. 
‘HAPPY SUNDAY!! Roman’s breakfast first then tired Mummas 🥞 💤 #stayhome #staysafe #breakfastinbed #mumlife #nomakeup #pancakes,’ Lucy captioned the image. 
It comes after Lucy shared her reservations about Roman getting his first set of injections. 
‘Romans immunisations are very soon.. Also both our post natal checks,’ she explained. 
‘And I’m not gonna lie I feel anxious. I feel like we have been isolating for so long in our safe bubble I don’t want him to be near anyone. or in pain from the [injection emoji]. 
‘This has made me feel a little better! I also realise they are super important!!’ 
Lucy and Ryan also spent some quality time with the former Coronation Street actor’s daughter Scarlett, with the family grabbing some fresh air amid lockdown with baby Roman strapped to Lucy’s chest in a carrier. 
‘Love it when I’ve got all my squad together,’ Ryan said alongside the cute family selfie. 
The family are finally reunited after Scarlett had to wait a couple of weeks to meet baby Roman to avoid possibly exposing the newborn to coronavirus. 
‘Thank God for technology! I’m finding it really tough being away from my family and sad this is how my daughter met her baby brother,’ Ryan told his social media followers at the time.
‘To any other broken families I feel your pain and it’s killing me being apart from my daughter and family for so long, especially at this special time. ‘BUT we all need to take social isolation and social distancing seriously and it’s a sacrifice we have to make to save lives.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Helen Storms
Hoda Kotb and her daughters are making the most of quarantine.
The Today Show’sHoda Kotb and her two young daughters are making the most of quarantine with an ice cream party. In an adorable Instagram photo that 55-year-old Kotb shared on Saturday, her 3-year-old daughter Haley Joy can be seen munching on an ice cream cone.
Kotb stood outside of her family’s New York city home as she snapped a photo of her daughter through an open window. Haley stood inside smiling up at her mother, gripping a half eaten cone in one hand with ice cream and sprinkles all over her mouth. She wore purple glasses and a pink Sesame Street t-shirt. Behind Haley was a small table with what appears to be a child’s homemade ice cream machine on top. It included everything she needed to make the perfect cone, including ice cream scoops and a glass dish with colorful sprinkles.
While the 3-year-old was not likely actually selling her cones, she had made it look like a mini ice cream stand. With the help of her mother she drew pictures of ice cream cones and hearts on colorful construction paper which were taped up on the window frame. One sign read the cones were a mere $.10 while another cheerful looking pink sign read “Haley and Hope’s Ice Cream Party.” Even though 1-year-old Hope was not in the photo, it was clear she had been included in the fun.
Hoda Kotb’s followers loved the sweet photo and it soon racked up over 33,000 likes in just an hour. Kotb has a whopping 1.6 million followers on the platform overall. Many of her fans took to the comment section to compliment her on the sweet photo, some saying they liked her creative idea and might try it out with their own children.
“It looks like the staff there is eating all the goodies!!” one person joked.
“What an adorable and happy child!” another person gushed.
“I’ll bet any day with Hope and Haley is a fun party day,” one fan wrote.
One person jokingly pointed out in the midst of all that is going on in the world, little Haley might want to consider raising the price of her ice cream a little bit.
“Up it to $.25 it’s 2020,” they wrote.
As The Inquisitr previously reported, the coronavirus pandemic has caused Kotb and her fiance Joel Schiffman to discuss postponing their wedding. They had hoped for a simple beach wedding over the summer but are considering putting things on hold for now to be safe.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby quits TV role and issues poignant statement</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has quit Celebrity Juice, she has announced.
The mum-of-three has left her role on the ITV2 show after over a decade.
Holly, aged 39, had spent 12 years on the series.
She starred alongside the likes of Fearne Cotton and host Keith Lemon.
But pal Fearne quit in 2018 - and now Holly, who also serves as This Morning presenter, has joined her in departing.
On Instagram, Holly paid tribute to the show in a gushing post.
She wrote how she would miss “12 years of fantastic chaos," adding: “I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone.
“Thank you to you all for watching. We’ve always had the loudest and best audiences….
“It’s never felt like work and always been to me like a night out.
“Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work…  All good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever.
“It’s time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky, lucky person.”
She said of Lemon: “I remember starting this journey with you and saying ‘I think this might work’. My goodness me it did.
“Three friends, you me and  Fearne Cotton … and that is what is at the heart of it, friendship. I love the bones of you Lemon!
“Thank you for making me laugh for 12 years… I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby's Celebrity Juice replacement tipped to be Michelle Keegan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Celebrity Juice fans were devastated on Sunday to learn team captain Holly Willoughby was stepping down from the show after 12 years.
This Morning presenter Holly was one of the originals on the raunchy ITV2 series alongside host Keith Lemon.
Their pal Fearne Cotton quit the role in 2018, with her soon replaced by Paddy McGuinness - while Mel B most recently took over due to filming conflicts.
With other past panellists including Rufus Hound and Gino D'Acampo having been on the show in the past, Holly has outlived them all.
Keith paid tribute to Holly after the announcement, while a replacement is yet to be confirmed by the show.
That said, former Our Girl actress Michelle Keegan is hotly tipped to step in as the new captain.
She's been a hit on the show in the past, while husband Mark Wright has also appeared.
As names are thrown into the mix on who will join the show, Michelle could be the front runner.
Ladbrokes bookmakers are pitting former Coronation Street star Michelle at the top of the list, with odds of 4/1.
She recently left her role on BBC's Our Girl, so her diary may be free!
Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said: "Michelle Keegan's no stranger to Celebrity Juice and she could soon become a permanent fixture if the latest odds are anything to go by."
Following Michelle, the next name at the top is show favourite and former Gogglebox star Scarlett Moffatt.
She stands at 9/2, while Ladbrokes are also placing bets on a surprise return from former captain Fearne.
Some others potentially in the frame include Emma Bunton, Eamonn Holmes, Kelly Brook and Rylan Clark-Neal.
Also on the list, but less likely according to the bookmakers, are Gemma Collins, Emma Willis, Cat Deeley and Davina McCall.
Celeb Juice airs Thursdays at 10pm on ITV2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fearne Cotton breaks silence on Holly Willoughby quitting Celebrity Juice</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fearne Cotton has broken her silence after Holly Willoughby announced she's quit Celebrity Juice.
Holly, 39, confirmed she is leaving the madcap ITV2 show on Sunday after 12 years on the panel.
Her exit followed her best friend Fearne, 38, stepping down from the Keith Lemon-fronted series herself two years ago.
Taking to Instagram, Holly posted a long statement about why she was leaving as she shared some memories from her time on the show.
And while Fearne is yet to say much about Holly following in her footsteps, she commented on the Instagram post to voice her support for Holly.
She posted a string of love heart emojis in solidarity.
Fearne decided to leave the show in 2018 as her career started taking a different turn as she focused on her wellness brand.
Holly had written: "Thank you @celebjuiceofficial for 12 years of fantastic chaos... I can't quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone. Thank you to you all for watching, we’ve always had the loudest and best audiences.
"Also a huge thank you to @itv2 for believing in the show in the first place and for all of your support...Over the years the production team has changed, however to anyone lucky enough to have worked on the show they will know that we really do have the best time, it’s never felt like work and always been to me like a night out.
"Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work... all good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever."
Celebrity Juice host Keith has also commented on the news.
He posted: "I've had a lovely time working with you. You are the best! I hope I'm lucky enough to work with you again one day. Goodbye @hollywills x."
Holly has already filmed her final scenes for Celebrity Juice.
Her replacement is yet to be announced, but the favourite is currently Michelle Keegan.

Holly went on to tease who her replacement could be as she continued: ‘Thank you for all your ingenious ideas and hard work… all good things must come to an end and nothing lasts forever… It’s time for me to hand over my team captain seat to some lucky lucky person… whoever that is, know you are about to get one of the best jobs in telly working with one of comedies finest…Keith Lemon.

‘Thank you for making me laugh for twelve years… I’ll be back as a guest and just to make sure someone is keeping you in check… if I don’t see you through a week or next week or the week after… know you are always in my heart..’
Shortly after Holly’s announcement, Keith shared a hilarious video on social media with the sweetest caption.
‘I’ve had a lovely time working with you. You are the best!
‘I hope I’m lucky enough to work with you again one day.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Celebrity Juice: Keith Lemon shares hilarious Holly Willoughby video as This Morning presenter 'quits' series</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has reportedly quit Celebrity Juice after 12 years.
The This Morning presenter has been a panellist on the ITV2 series since it began in 2008, but is said to be stepping down to spend more time with her family.
Willoughby follows Fearne Cotton, who quit the show in December 2018. Cotton’s replacement, Paddy McGuinness, left after one series before Spice Girl Mel B took over.
It’s unknown who could replace Willoughby.
A number of episodes recorded in lockdown are expected be her last appearance on the series, which is presented by Keith Lemon.
“Holly has absolutely loved her time on the show – it’s been a huge part of her life, and has really helped to expand her fanbase over the years,” a source told The Sun on Sunday.
“But she feels now is the right time to bow out and wants to free up a bit more of her busy schedule to spend with her family.”
Ahead of the reports, Lemon shared a video of Willoughby on Instagram, in which he looks shocked as she shouts the word “f***” at the screen.
He captioned it: “Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in. One of the boys but all woman. Super rad! Super nice! My mate! I salute all your wonderfulness. Massive hugs.”
Willoughby responded: “Aww... what a lovely thing to say... love you Lemon.”
The Independent has contacted a representative of Willoughby for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hollywood artist tutors Arabic-speaking kids during pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was during a phone conversation with her sister back in Qatar that the idea clicked for Hollywood animation artist Reem Ali Adeeb.
Like other regions across the world, young children in the Middle East were confined at home because of the COVID-19 pandemic, but there was not nearly enough original content online in Arabic to keep them entertained, such as fun tutorials and other activities.
So Ali Adeeb, a Syrian-born animation artist who works at Warner Bros. Entertainment in Los Angeles, and her sister Sandi, a university lecturer of pharmaceutics in Qatar, decided to take matters into their own hands.
The pair set up "Susupreemo," a YouTube channel designed to help Arabic-speaking kids—and their stressed-out parents—weather the coronavirus lockdowns through basic tutorials on drawing, making origami or simply reading children's books, all in Arabic.
"The idea is to create videos to engage the kids," said Ali Adeeb, who at Warner Bros. has worked on children's shows including "Green Eggs and Ham," a Netflix animated series based on the Dr. Seuss classic.
"There's tons of content on the web in English for kids but there is not enough original content in Arabic," added the 34-year-old who is now working from home on the second season of the Netflix show. "So the aim is to make their screen time interactive and inspiring by drawing with them, reading them a story or doing crafts."
Ali Adeeb said her sister's 7-year-old son Omar has even joined in the fun, offering origami tutorials to his peers.
"He's been the best. He's done the most among us with three videos recorded already," she said.
Ali Adeeb herself is using some of the characters from "Green Eggs and Ham," notably Chickeraffe, a chicken/giraffe hybrid, to draw young viewers into her world.
Sandi for her part keeps her young audience focused and allows their imagination to travel by reading them children's books.
"I thought I would read for kids during a time where buying or lending a book is very challenging, especially for some disadvantaged kids in some Arab countries," she told AFP in an email.
"I started with a book suitable for children aged 3 to 6 years old and now I am selecting more books that can engage the kids for longer periods," she added.
A new reality
The response, so far, has been overwhelmingly positive with children enthusiastically sharing their drawings via email and parents thankful for the opportunity to be able to hold work meetings online without being interrupted or just have some time for themselves.
In a region often wracked by war, and where children faced a harsh reality even before the pandemic, experts say such tutorials offer kids a reprieve whether in the comfort of their homes or even in refugee camps.
"Nowadays, children worldwide are confined in their homes, and children in the Middle East are no exception," said Annamaria Laurini, the former head of UNICEF in Lebanon.
"Suddenly their own world has disappeared -- no more school, no more play with their friends and no more human interactions except with their family," she added. "It's a lonely reality that makes it difficult to dream, that confines their imagination to the walls of their room -- if they are so lucky to have one."
Soha Bsat Boustani, a UNICEF consultant based in Beirut, said the YouTube tutorials are much needed in a region where such material in Arabic for children is lagging in terms of creativity and innovation.
"And so, initiatives like 'Susupreemo' can only be seen in a positive light as it gives children a healthy way out of confinement and a sense of normalcy."  
So far Ali Adeeb, her sister and nephew have produced seven videos and they hope to continue with their project even after the pandemic.
"I'm thinking now of teaching kids how to draw popular cartoon characters ... and I'm hoping to open this space for other artists," she said. "I have a friend who is a dancer and I would love for her to teach kids how to dance.
"There's a lot more we can do."

"And so, initiatives like 'Susupreemo' can only be seen in a positive light as it gives children a healthy way out of confinement and a sense of normalcy."
So far Ali Adeeb, her sister and nephew have produced seven videos and they hope to continue with their project even after the pandemic.
"I'm thinking now of teaching kids how to draw popular cartoon characters ... and I'm hoping to open this space for other artists," she said. "I have a friend who is a dancer and I would love for her to teach kids how to dance.
"There's a lot more we can do."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quebec designer launches mask line inspired by star skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL - A Quebec fashion designer has launched a line of high-end designer masks inspired by the costumes of the Olympic figure skaters he dresses.
Mathieu Caron has been designing and manufacturing outfits for several years, including the spectacular outfits worn by Canadian Olympic champion Tessa Virtue and world silver medalist Shoma Uno of Japan, among others.
The profits from the mask sales go to the World Health Organization in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
"We took the same materials as the skaters’ costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely recreated the form to make masks,” said Caron, who also designs dancewear, gownS and wedding dresses.
"My primary goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than an ordinary mask.”
The limited-edition masks are not for all budgets - the eight models cost between $150 and $300.
Japanese customers were not deterred, snatching items inspired by Uno’s costumes, which retail for $200 to $250. Initially, the idea was to design a maximum of 15 masks for each skater, but in Japan, they sold 70.
"I was surprised,” Caron said. "In times of crisis like this, I honestly didn’t think people had so much money to buy a mask.”
Caron says his goal was not to heighten his brand.
"It was more an artistic contribution to do our part with some members of my team who also got involved in the decoration,” he said. "But with everything we have sold, we will not be unemployed for the next few weeks.”
The masks are made of cotton and polyester fibers. The fabrics come from the same materials as the skaters’ outfits. The material is breathable, with padding to give shape and structure.
"Now, is it something medical? Not at all,” Caron said. "We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector’s item.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Molly Mae Hague and Tommy Fury are the latest stars to fall victim to notorious celebrity prankster Josh Pieters.
He made the oblivious Love Island finalists think they were being interviewed by James Corden on the Late Late Show.
Clips of the US favourite asking random questions were snatched from other shows by the YouTube star, who cobbled together an interview as the pair sat on their sofa dressed to impress.
They were told by a fake producer that transatlantic issues means they couldn't actually see James asking his questions - but he could see them.
Like his others victims, they only find out when the video drops online.
They didn't even twig when a soundbite of James saying 'oh wow' was played a number of times at their less than amazing answers.
James begun: "So, you two are dating?"
Confused boxer Tommy responded: "It might be a bit past dating, but call it that if you want!"
Fake James then asked them to explain what it is they actually do.
He also wanted to know who would play them in a movie - and asked who was doing the housework in lockdown.
The comedian kept them going for a few minutes without the couple thinking a thing was wrong.
Funnyman Josh has history - he wound up Katie Hopkins by dragging the controversial star to Prague to collect a fake award earlier this year.
He presented Katie with a trophy for a lifetime achievement award at a fake ceremony for made-up campaign group The Cape Town Collective For Freedom of Speech.
Josh said he emailed her asking if she would fly to accept their made-up award, dubbed the Campaign to Unify the Nation Trophy.
Things turned controversial as she was recorded mocking Muslims, Asian people and epilepsy sufferers.
Fans loved his latest prank as he stitched up the Love Island stars.
"Josh! You're spoiling us!!!" one posted.
Another said: "Let's just hope James Corden sees the funny side!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love Island’s Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury tricked into thinking they’re on James Corden’s US chatshow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOVE Island's Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury were duped into thinking they were appearing on James Corden's hit American chat show in a cruel prank.
The pair appeared via link from their Manchester home believing they were talking to the Gavin & Stacey star - but were actually being played old clips off him.
YouTube pranksters Josh Pieters and Archie Manners were behind the elaborate joke, posing as TV producers who told them they wouldn't be able to see James because of technical issues.
The pair then played Tommy and Molly old clips of the Late Late Show host from previous shows, including the same recording of the host saying "Oh woooow" which popped up again and again.
The first question seemed to catch them by surprise with 'James' saying: "I don't know if people know this - you two are a couple. You're dating."
Seeming surprised that the fact might have escaped anyone, Tommy replied: "You could call it dating if you want. We might be a little bit past that, but OK."
The pair continued with their questions punctuating it regularly with the same clips of James giggling.
Another recording of the 41-year-old TV star heard him saying: "Now in the UK everybody knows what you do. Try to explain to these folks if you can a little what it is you actually do?"
Tommy, 20, replied that he was a "professional boxer" and Molly a "full-time influencer" as they explained the story of their Love Island romance.
The fake host then asked who they would want to play them in a movie, with Tommy saying Leonardo DiCaprio while Molly-Mae chose his Wolf Of Wall Street co-star Margot Robbie.
 
The clip ended with the pair seemingly none the wiser that they had been tricked - and that, contrary to what they had been told, would not be appearing on The Late Late Show.
Nonetheless it delighted YouTube fans, with one laughing: "The 'Oh wooow' sounds so fake that I die every time it comes up."
Another wrote: "I kinda feel like some of these guys are having their doubts but don’t wanna risk it actually being James Corden."
Tommy and Molly-Mae shot to reality-star fame on Love Island's summer series last year but were unexpectedly beaten to the top prize by Amber Gill and Greg O'Shea.
Yet, Love Island fans will not see the popular show return in 2020 after the summer series was cancelled due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury pranked into James Corden ‘interview’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Love Island stars Molly-Mae Hague and Tommy Fury are among the latest stars to have fallen victim to prankster Josh Pieters. 
The couple were tricked into believing they had landed an interview on the Late Late Show with James Corden recently when actually, it was YouTube star Josh orchestrating the fake chat behind the scenes. 
Molly-Mae and Tommy, both 20, thought they were in communication with a producer who had booked them in for a spot on the US chat show via video link, due to the coronavirus pandemic. 
However, it was simply Josh and his crew using segments of an old interview James did with Julia Michaels and JP Saxe. 
In one of his lines, James says: ‘I don’t know if people know this but you are a couple? You’re dating.’ 
The reality stars nodded in unison – although slightly confused at the obvious line of questioning – as Tommy confirmed: ‘You can call it dating if you want, yeah. It might be a little bit past that but OK,’ referring to the fact they’ve lived together for months.’ 
James then ‘asked’ how the couple have been coping ‘sheltering’ together during the lockdown, to which Molly-Mae replied: ‘It’s been fine, he’s been working out a lot. I’ve been doing a lot of tidying.’ 
Boxer Tommy added: ‘I miss being punched in the face but what can you do?’ 
At one point, the so-called producers make out there’s a wifi issue between Tommy and Molly and James, prompting them to momentarily halt the interview before resuming. 
The talk show host then asks Tommy who he’d love to play in a movie to which the boxer chose Leonardo DiCaprio, while Molly-Mae opted for Margot Robbie so they could have a ‘Wolf of Wall Street moment’. 
‘Producer’ Josh then wrapped up the interview with an outro from James, bringing his prank to a close without suspicion.
Tommy and Molly shouldn’t feel too bad though as they aren’t the only stars who have been targeted in Josh’s three-day prank series – singer Craig David also made the cut. 
Earlier this year, Josh famously pranked Katie Hopkins into believing she had won a Campaign to Unify the Nation Trophy award, even flying her out to Prague, but it was entirely fake.

Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik are expecting their first child, the supermodel told US talkshow host Jimmy Fallon Friday.
Hadid has been dating Malik on-and-off since 2015, celebrating her 25th birthday with him in quarantine on her mother’s Pennsylvania farm last weekend.
US media had reported she was pregnant after family sources spoke to TMZ.
“Obviously, you know, we wish we could’ve announced it on our own terms, but we’re very excited and happy and grateful for everyone’s well wishes and support,” Hadid told Fallon via video-link.

She is quarantining in New Hope, roughly 30 miles outside Philadelphia with Malik, her mother Yolanda Hadid, sister Bella and friend Leah McCarthy.
But Hadid — who has modeled for Chanel and Victoria’s Secret among others — said it was a “nice silver lining to be able to be home, be together, and really experience it day by day.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Yolanda Hadid Very Excited About Gigi’s Pregnancy: ‘She Considers Zayn Malik One Of Her Own’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yolanda Hadid is so excited about becoming a grandmother! The former Real Housewives star, whose supermodel daughter Gigi Hadid is expecting her first child with Zayn Malik, remained super tight-lipped about the pregnancy. “Yolanda was very quiet about Gigi and Zayn’s announcement until they said something,” a source close to the family told HollywoodLife. “She ignored several calls and texts about the topic even to her closest friends. Everyone was reaching out to her, and she’d reply very short replies if anything, but she didn’t address the topic.”
The source described the mom-of-three as a “mama bear” and revealed she already thinks of Zayn as one of her own. “Yolanda is a great person and friend and can be trusted and she’s a mama bear who protects her children always,” they dished. “She considers Zayn as one of her own. If they work for her kids, they work for her. The family didn’t think it would get out there since so few people knew, but they’re all very, very excited and happy.”
After a few days of speculation over whether or not there was a bun in her oven, Gigi confirmed the news while speaking with Jimmy Fallon. “Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms, but we’re very excited and happy and grateful for everyone’s well wishes and support,” she said during the Apr. 30 edition of The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon. She also confirmed that Zayn in the father, after some thought that Tyler Cameron might have been the one who got her pregnant.
Gigi, who was isolating with her family on their Pennsylvania farm, said that this current pandemic has provided “a silver lining,” since it was nice for her to “be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day.” During the chat, she also dished on her biggest pregnancy craving. She said that she eats an “everything bagel” every day, and she was excited that her 25th birthday cake was actually a giant everything bagel. “Then I found out that Buddy [Valastro], the ‘Cake Boss,’ made my cake … I don’t know if it was my hormones right now or just, like, quarantine emotional-ness, but I cried every five minutes for an hour every time I thought about that Buddy made my cake.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gigi Hadid Reveals Her Biggest Pregnancy Craving After Confirming She’s Expecting A Baby With Zayn Malik</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s been a big week for Gigi Hadid. After the supermodel turned 25 on April 23rd, it was revealed that she was expecting her first baby with boyfriend Zayn Malik. Hadid confirmed the news during an appearance on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon this week, and she also dished on her biggest pregnancy craving.
The Victoria’s Secret model told Fallon that she celebrated her 25th birthday with both a breakfast party and a dinner party. In the morning, Hadid says her family brought out an everything bagel cake, which “blew” her mind.
“My craving has been everything bagels. I eat an everything bagel a day. I was already so excited that my birthday cake was an everything bagel,” said Hadid. “I found out that Buddy the Cake Boss made my cake! I don’t know if it was my hormones right now or just quarantine emotions, but I cried every five minutes for, like, an hour every time I thought about how Buddy made my cake.”
TMZ was first to break the news that Hadid and Malik were expecting. Hadid admitted that she wishes she and Malik could have announced their pregnancy in their own way, but ultimately they are excited and happy.
Hadid explained that being pregnant right now while in quarantine with her family – including Malik – at their ranch in Pennsylvania has actually been a positive thing because she and Malik can focus on the pregnancy and be in the moment instead of dealing with their busy careers.
Hadid and Malik rekindled their romance four months ago, after being on-and-off for years. An insider said at the time that Hadid and Malike are “so in love,” and she has always wanted to start a family with the former One Direction singer.
Another source claims that Hadid was trying to keep her pregnancy “low-key” before the news was leaked. Now that everyone knows, Hadid is excited to be a mom and “so happy to be pregnant,” says the source.
The best part for Gigi Hadid, claims the insider, is that she is “embarking on this new journey of motherhood” with Zayn Malik by her side.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MUMBAI: Veteran actor Rishi Kapoor's ashes were immersed in Banganga tank here on Sunday, his elder brother Randhir Kapoor said.
Rishi Kapoor died at the age of 67 on April 30 at H N Reliance hospital in south Mumbai, after a two year long battle with leukaemia.
Randhir Kapoor said a prayer meet for the actor was held on Saturday.
"We did prayer meet yesterday. Today we immersed his ashes in Banganga as we haven't received permission from the authorities to go to Haridwar," Randhir Kapoor told PTI.

According to family sources, the actor's daughter Riddhima Kapoor Sahni, who was unable to attend the funeral as she was travelling from Delhi by road, was present at the prayer meet.
"There were not many people, Only five-six family members," the insider said.
Rishi Kapoor had returned to India last September after undergoing treatment for cancer in the US for almost a year.
In February, he was hospitalised twice.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Who could forget Cat Valentine of Victorious and Sam & Cat? On Saturday, Ariana Grande remembered her Nickelodeon days, after taking home an award for Favorite Female Artist during Nickelodeon'sKid Choice Awards 2020: Celebrate Together.The singer used her video acceptance speech to thank fans for their ongoing support, but also to acknowledge the special role the network has played in her career.
Grande began her video by shouting out fans who voted for her, saying, "I just wanted to thank you so, so, so much for making me your favorite female music star, I'm very appreciative." The Sweetener singer added a special message about the network as well, saying, "Nickelodeon always will hold such a tremendous place in my heart, not only because of Victorious and Sam & Cat and the amazing years I spent working with them, but also just for SpongeBob, you know?"
The 2020 Kids Choice Awards televised event was one of the first award shows to air during the COVID-19 pandemic, which prohibits large gatherings of people and forced winners and presenters to participate remotely, as per Billboard. Victoria Justice, who co-starred with Grande on Victorious, hosted the virtual event, welcoming guests such as Dwayne Johnson, JoJo Siwa, Ellen DeGeneres, and more.
The Kids Choice Awards win was a full circle moment for Grande's career. Nickelodeon's sitcoms served as a launchpad for the singer's music career, as Grande was cast in Victorious in 2010, and recorded music for the popular series, as per IMDB. Later, Grande also appeared in spin-off series Sam & Cat, which aired in 2013.
Grande's KCA acceptance speech is not the first time the star has opened up about her television career. In 2014, Grande reflected on Sam & Cat after the show was canceled, saying of her character, "I admire her so much," in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. She added that she always loved how Cat had an, "appreciation for life and everybody she encounters" as well as "passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread." Grande added: "She always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good."
It's been many years since Grande appeared on either sitcom, but Cat Valentine had a role in making her the mega-star she is today. Never one to miss an opportunity to thank her dedicated fans (or shout out SpongeBob), the singer's acceptance speech hit the right note for the event.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cameron Diaz, Scarlett Johansson, Drew Barrymore and more break into epic fist fight for lockdown Boss B***h Challenge</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MARVEL star Scarlett Johansson, Florence Pugh, Margot Robbie, Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore and more iconic actors have starred in one epic fist-fight challenge, shared on social media.
The challenge sees them all film a scene individually that has then been edited together so that it looks like one extended fight scene.
"I’m so bored! I just want to play with my friends!" says 41-year-old Zoe, kicking off the video as she reads a book.
“Wait a minute, I can play with my friends!" she exclaims, as she walks towards the camera and punching it - with the edit switching to reveal Lucy, 52, who jumps back from the kick and calls out: "What the heck, Zozo?"
Lucy then delivers a punch and the video continues on - although with child stars including Once Upon A Time In Hollywood's Julia Butters also appearing, there are moments where the stuntwomen choose to tickle or let a dog lick the girls, rather than punch a child in the face.
Julia has no such qualms though, and quickly smashes her elbow toward the camera, while Little Women star Florence joins in the fun by picking up a wine bottle before smartly checking herself putting it down and picking up a dog toy to smash into the camera instead.
Margot was clearly inspired by her DC Comics character Harley Quinn as she picks a baseball bat to aim towards the camera.
Halle Berry, 53, meanwhile, falls into a swimming pool before recovering and delivering a punch worthy of any stuntwomen.
Juliette Lewis, Hamilton star Renee Elise Goldberry and Rosario Dawson all also star, while Scottish singer KT Tunstall - whose song The Healer soundtracks the video - appears at the end and asks to be included next time.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WATCH: Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson & Cameron Diaz feature in Instagram Fight Club</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Stuntwoman and actress Zoë Bell has created a virtual fight club on Instagram including plenty of famous faces such as Margot Robbie, Scarlett Johansson, Cameron Diaz and Halle Berry.
The idea may sound a bit outlandish but the all-female fight scene is very well put together and definitely worth a watch.
Bell has labelled the creation '#BossBitchFightChallenge'.
She's known for her work in popular Quentin Tarantino films such as Kill Bill: Volume 1, The Hateful Eight and Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.
Some of the best moments in the five-minute clip include Johansson using a medicine ball as a weapon, Robbie taking a swing with her Harley Quinn baseball bat and Berry taking her shot after falling into a pool.
Enjoy!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Some of your favorite celebrities are staying connected in more ways than one during social distancing. In case you haven't already seen it on your Instagram timeline, we're talking about the Boss B*tch Fight Challenge. Actress and stuntwoman Zoë Bell enlisted several Hollywood heavyweights to create a continuous fight scene, which dropped on May 1. Each snippet of the stars — including Halle Berry, Florence Pugh, and Drew Barrymore — features them kicking, punching, or slamming something into the camera before it cuts to the next person, who takes the impact. Other participants include Zoe Saldana, Cameron Diaz, Julia Butters, Scarlett Johansson, and Margot Robbie (who uses her Harley Quinn bat to take a swing at the camera lens). Between the phenomenal acting and impressive editing, this might be all we watch for the rest of the day.

    <h5 class="mb-1">#BossBitchFightChallenge Video Is a Star-Studded Melee</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Like all of us, Zoë Bell is starting to get a little bored at home. Unlike most of us, what she’d normally be doing instead of reading a book is kicking ass on screen as a stunt double for folks like Lucy Lawless (Xena: Warrior Princess), Uma Thurman (Kill Bill) and Cate Blanchett (Thor: Ragnarok). The New Zealand stuntwoman and actress, who also played Janet Miller in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and Six-Horse Judy in The Hateful Eight, enlisted many of her actor and stuntwomen friends for an Epic #BossBitchFightChallenge set the to KT Tunstall’s “The Healer” that you just have to watch.
Participating brawlers include Lawless, Drew Barrymore, Juliette Lewis, Rosario Dawson, Cameron Diaz, Florence Pugh, Daryl Hannah, Zoe Saldana, Rosie Perez, Thandie Newton, Halle Berry, Scarlett Johansson, Margot Robbie, and many others. And Tunstall has her own cameo at the end.
Bravo, Ms. Bell. We’re glad you got to play with your friends.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hollywood stunt professional Zoe Bell has organized an all-female quarantine fight club, and it’s a star-studded, action-packed affair.
“I’m so bored! I just want to play with my friends!” says Bell, who doubled for Uma Thurman in the “Kill Bill” movies. Tossing aside the book she was reading, she walks up to the camera and declares, “Wait a minute, I can play with my friends!”
With that, she delivers a roundhouse kick aimed at the camera, with Lucy Lawless revealed as the recipient of the blow (Bell was also Lawless’ stunt double for “Xena: Warrior Princess”).
“What the heck, Zo-zo?” asks a ticked-off Lawless as her facial expression shifts from surprise to glee, firing back with a punch assisted by her “Xena” Chakram.
And then more female stars get in on the action. Through the magic of choreographed stunt fighting and clever editing, the end result is a who’s who of Hollywood’s female stars seemingly beating the tar out of each other in what Bell calls the #BossB***hFightChallenge.
Other of the many, many stars involved include Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz, Scarlett Johansson, Margot Robbie, Halle Berry, Thandie Netwon and Florence Pugh, who punch, kick and headbutt each other, some gaining assistance fomr an array of props ranging from shovels to sheep.
As the action continues, KT Tunstall’s song “The Healer” plays in the background as the soundtrack to all this mayhem.
“Here it is……! Kicking lockdown boredom with some of the coolest!” wrote Bell to accompany the YouTube video. “Ladies, you are all my heroes.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Loose Women presenters have rehearsed for the return of the TV show after six weeks away.
The panellists met this weekend to get ready for the new programmes, starting on ITV on Monday.
The daytime show, which came off screen because of the coronavirus pandemic, returns with social distancing measures in place.
Three women are on an extended panel, two metres apart, with a fourth panellist appearing via video-link.
Monday’s first live show will see Andrea McLean, Brenda Edwards and Nadia Sawalha on the panel with Coleen Nolan joining via video-link.
McLean said: “Loose Women has been a part of my life for 13 years, so to suddenly not be meeting up with my friends, catching up over a latte and hearing the latest about what’s going on in their lives has been really strange.
“As the whole world will agree – chatting over video call just isn’t the same.
“I can’t wait to get back to work, get back into the studio and give our lovely viewers some much-needed love and laughter at lunchtime.”
Nolan said: “Although we won’t have our lovely live audience there for a little while longer, we promise to still make them smile at home.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Loose Women rehearse for return of ITV daytime stalwart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Social distancing measures will be in place on the show.
Loose Women presenters have rehearsed for the return of the TV show after six weeks away.
The panellists met this weekend to get ready for the new programmes, starting on ITV on Monday.
The daytime show, which came off screen because of the coronavirus pandemic, returns with social distancing measures in place.
Three women are on an extended panel, two metres apart, with a fourth panellist appearing via video-link.
Monday’s first live show will see Andrea McLean, Brenda Edwards and Nadia Sawalha on the panel with Coleen Nolan joining via video-link.
McLean said: “Loose Women has been a part of my life for 13 years, so to suddenly not be meeting up with my friends, catching up over a latte and hearing the latest about what’s going on in their lives has been really strange.
“As the whole world will agree – chatting over video call just isn’t the same.
“I can’t wait to get back to work, get back into the studio and give our lovely viewers some much-needed love and laughter at lunchtime.”
Nolan said: “Although we won’t have our lovely live audience there for a little while longer, we promise to still make them smile at home.”
Loose Women returns on Monday at 12.30pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Loose Women panel tease first-look from live studio after 6 week break</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Loose Women panel has teased a first-look from the studio as they prepare to air the first live show in six weeks.
And to be honest we can’t wait!
The daytime favourite will be back on our screens from their live studio from Monday, 4 May, after taking a break due to the spread of coronavirus. 
However, there will be adjustments in filming to adhere to social distancing restrictions.
Monday’s first live show will see Andrea Mclean, Brenda Edwards and Nadia Sawalha on the panel with Coleen Nolan joining via video-link.
Later in the week Ruth Langsford, Linda Robson, Jane Moore and Saira Khan, via video link, will all be on the panel for new shows. 
And it seems the Loose Women ladies can’t wait to be back on our screens.
Andrea exclaimed: ‘Loose Women has been a part of my life for thirteen years, so to suddenly not be meeting up with my friends, catching up over a latte and hearing the latest about what’s going on in their lives has been really strange.
‘As the whole world will agree – chatting over video call just isn’t the same! I can’t wait to get back to work, get back into the studio and give our lovely viewers some much-needed love and laughter at lunchtime; it’s what we Loose Women do best.’
Coleen went on to comment on how she had missed all their chats.
She said: ‘I’m so excited the show is back in the studio. I’ve really missed our chats and debates. And although we won’t have our lovely live audience there for a little while longer, we promise to still make them smile at home.’
The ITV chat show previously filmed with a skeleton crew and no audience as Covid-19 began to spread.
Other ITV daytime shows including This Morning and Good Morning Britain have gone ahead, although presenters and guests must sit two metres apart to ensure social distancing measures are in place.
Nadia added: ‘We can’t wait to share all that’s been going on with the audience as they have always been the fifth loose woman.
‘We’ve shared everything over the last twenty years, so it’s only right and proper that we share now at one of the most difficult times in recent history. Missed you girls.’
Loose Women will return to ITV at 12.30pm on 4 May.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kara Bosworth's dad Matt Keough dies weeks after tragic stillborn birth of her baby son</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reality star Kara Bosworth has been devastated by the death of her father mere weeks after the tragic stillborn birth of her baby son.
The Real Housewives of Orange County star, 32, has been rocked by the loss of dad Matt Keough, a former Oaklands Athletics pitcher and her special assistant, who died on Saturday at the age of 64.
Having lost her baby son in a stillborn birth a few weeks ago, Kara has now been left grieving over her beloved father.
Sharing a moving tribute to Matt on Instagram, Kara shared a sweet selection of throwback images of her father.
Caption the picture, Kara writes: "Daddy, please take care of my son.
"Teach him the circle changeup and how to find forever friends. You’re on grandpa duty in heaven now.
"Xoxo, Hammerhead."
Matt was married to Kara's mother and former Real Housewives of Orange County star Jeana Keough until their divorce last year, despite being separated for fifteen years.
The former couple had three children together, including Kara herself and her brothers Shane and Colton.
Jeana has herself posted a throwback tribute of her own on Instagram, with two handsome images of her late former husband.
Meanwhile, Oakland Athletics have now released their own statement on Matt's death.
Billy Beane, the team's executive vice president of baseball operations, commented: "Matt was a great baseball man and a proud Oakland A.
"He had an incredible passion for the game and we were lucky to have him and his wealth of knowledge alongside us for the years he worked as a special assistant.
"He left an unforgettable impression on everyone he touched in baseball.
"Our sincere condolences are with the entire Keough family tonight."
The post by Kara has seen an outpouring of support and grief in the replies.
Former RHOC star Tamra Judge comments: "Oh Kara. I am so sorry. Big hugs."
Fellow RHOC alumn Vicki Gunvalson also offers words of support to Kara.
Vicki writes: "Kara, I am so sorry. There are no words to say except that you are loved."
The tragedy comes after Kara's heartbreaking post last month that confirmed the loss of her and husband Kyle Bosworth's son McCoy Casey Bosworth on April 6.
She wrote at the time: "Weighing in at 11 pounds and 4 ounces and spanning 21 inches, McCoy surprised us all with his size and strength (and overall perfection).
"During the course of his birth, he experienced shoulder dystocia and a compressed umbilical cord.
"He joined our Heavenly Father and will live forever in the hearts of his loving parents, his adoring sister, and those that received his life-saving gifts."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A seven-year-old Missouri girl is being hailed as a hero after first responders say her actions were responsible for saving her father’s life.
“We’re just lucky that Lillie was home,” mother Samantha Davis told KY3.
Lillie Davis was hanging out at home last month when her father, Seth, went to go light a cigarette and began having a seizure.
Seth has had epilepsy since he was a child.
Luckily, Lillie had trained for an emergency such as this since she was five years old.
“My dad was laying on the ground, so I went into my room to call mom,” Lillie told KY3.
Lillie called her mother, who called 911 from work, and the two of them went through a checklist.
“I had said put your hand on his chest, to make sure that he is still breathing and she said that it was moving,” Samantha added. “I was like okay, are his lips blue? Because sometimes he’ll hold his breath when he’s having a seizure and she said, well his head is down on the ground and I said turn it so you can see his mouth, so she turned it.”
Lillie had already opened the door for first responders when they arrived.
“I’ve never seen it in my career — a child that young on her own, to know what to do in an emergency situation like that,” Lt. Vance Farmer of the Willow Springs Fire Department said.
Willow Springs Police and Fire recognized her bravery and life-saving actions by presenting her with a Certificate of Bravery.
Lillie is not the first kid at that young of an age to show remarkable bravery in saving family members. A six-year-old boy from Oklahoma showed off his bravery by saving his two younger cousins when the boat they were on exploded.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Family files complaint after 81-year-old dies at Minn. care facility overwhelmed by coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO/CNN) - The family of an 81-year-old Minnesota man, who died after testing positive for coronavirus, has filed a complaint against his long-term care facility, where roughly half of residents have been infected with COVID-19.
Michelle Krone never thought she would say goodbye to her 81-year-old father, Robert Krone, while draped in personal protective equipment, but she received a call April 23 from St. Therese of New Hope, the long-term care facility where he lived, telling her he was terminal.
When Michelle Krone and her mother, Margaret Krone, went to the care facility, it was the first time they had seen her father in weeks. It took him about 35 minutes to recognize them, but once he did, Michelle Krone says they “started feeding him and just held his hands.”
Robert Krone died eight days after his family found out he had COVID-19.
“We were able to hold his hand and tell him how much we loved him and appreciated the sacrifices and how he was a good father,” Michelle Krone said.
St. Therese announced Wednesday that roughly half the residents at the facility had been infected with COVID-19. A day later, it announced 47 residents had died.
The Krone family says they have filed a complaint with the Minnesota Department of Health against the facility, citing lack of communication with families and concerns over lack of PPE and proper staffing.
On March 12, more than a month before Robert Krone’s diagnosis, the care facility stopped allowing in-person visits. Michelle Krone says the next facility-wide update came April 23, telling families that COVID-19 was making its way through the center.
“We wanted to know – and this was before his diagnosis – how bad was it: do we need to take him out of the facility and bring him home?” she said.
The facility says they never violated the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Though MDH did not find problems during an April 1 survey, they have said they will investigate complaints.
Margaret Krone is now showing symptoms and waiting for COVID-19 test results. Michelle Krone was tested, too.

    <h5 class="mb-1">EastEnders fans still convinced Phil is Kayden's biological father</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">EastEnders fans are still convinced Phil Mitchell is the biological father of Sharon's son, baby Kayden Watts.
In 2018, Phil's wife Sharon had an affair with Arches mechanic Keanu Taylor. But last year, Keanu and Sharon spent a night together and Sharon fell pregnant.
During her pregnancy, Sharon had a DNA test done which proved that Phil is not the father.
On the EastEnders 35th anniversary week, Sharon gave birth to her second son. But her joy was short lived as the same day she was given the news her oldest son Dennis had died in the boat crash.
Struggling with grief, she left her newborn in the care of Keanu's mum Karen, who named the tot.

But viewers are still convinced Phil is really Kayden's dad.
In a Digital Spy forum one fan wrote: "Now that Sharon has given up the baby to his grandmother Karen, then surely there's no reason why Karen cannot just have the baby live with Keanu for good. She can just go to where Keanu is now living and hand over his baby to him.
"Everybody will be happy. What do you think?"
One fan replied saying: "I like Sharon but I don't want to see her lumbered with a baby. So I hope Keanu gets custody of Kayden and it leaves the door open for both of them to return in future. Unless there's a twist that Phil is the father?"
A second fan said: "I still think there is a chance the baby is Phil's. It will be used as a catalyst for a Phil/Sharon reunion, because Phil 'want's his family back'.
"There is a reason why Kayden is still on the Square when he could have easily been given to Keanu off-screen."

A third added: "True. Keanu was devastated at the prospect of both Kayden and Peggy growing up without him in their lives. As Sharon renounced Kayden you'd think Keanu would have jumped at the chance to raise his son and at least be there for one of his kids.
"The fact this hasn't happened and they're keeping Kayden on the Square with Karen makes me think it will turn out he's Phil's and Phil and Sharon will take him back when they find this out."
Another fan commented: "Still think he will turn out to be Phil's."
EastEnders next week airs Monday at 8pm and Tuesday at 7.30pm on BBC One.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ellen DeGeneres’ Oscars bodyguard accuses host of being ‘cold, sly and demeaning’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A bodyguard who was hired to protect Ellen DeGeneres at the Oscars has criticised the host for being “kind of demeaning”.
Tom Majercak was looking after DeGeneres as well as her mother and wife Portia de Rossi in 2014, the year Ellen was hosting the awards ceremony,
In an interview with Fox News, he claimed that Ellen was the one celebrity he’s worked with “that has never taken the time to say hi to me”, adding: “And I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities.”
Majercak said that things started off well thanks to de Rossi, who he described as “very pleasant”. However, things “started going negatively” when de Rossi introduced him to DeGeneres.
“Ellen pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn’t even say ‘hello,’ or ‘thank you for protecting my mother, my wife, and me,’” he continued.
“It was very cold and it was very sly and it was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.”
Majercak also said that celebrities had to be approved to come and talk to DeGeneres at her table during a high-profile after party.
He said that he came forward with his story after people claiming to be Ellen’s ex-employees shared some startling experiences they’re said to have had with the presenter on social media.
One story claimed that DeGeneres would send her staff at The Ellen DeGeneres Show home if they had failed to chew gum before speaking to her.
Another added: “A new staff member was told ‘every day she picks someone different to really hate. It’s not your fault, just suck it up for the day and she’ll be mean to someone else the next day.’ They didn’t believe it but it ended up being entirely true.”
“It’s bugged me for years,” Majercak said. “I see this person come across as being very enlightened and positive and awesome and everybody loves her and is in awe, and that’s really not the case when you meet her in person.”
A representative for DeGeneres has been contacted for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ellen not so nice? - Entertainment News</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ellen DeGeneres' reputation as the nicest woman in Hollywood has taken another hit - from a former bodyguard.Tom Majercak, who worked for the actress and TV personality at the 2014 Oscars, has opened up about his experience with the Finding Dory star, accusing her of being "cold" and "demeaning."He also claims she refused to look at him.Majercak, a senior manager of operations for Security Imagery Specialists, tells Fox News, "Ellen is the one person that I've been assigned to - and I've been assigned to quite a few celebrities - that has never taken the time to say hi to me."Adding that Ellen's wife, Portia De Rossi, was "very pleasant", he adds, "It started going negatively when she (Portia) introduced me to Ellen and Ellen pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn't even say 'hello,' or 'thank you for protecting my mother, my wife and me...'""It was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle... When you see her on TV, people fall in love with her but it is a false facade and bravado."DeGeneres first came under attack from transgender YouTube star NikkieTutorials, who took aim at the TV host for being "cold" towards her during an appearance on her daytime show in January."Maybe I'm being naive, but I expected them to welcome me with confetti: 'Welcome to The Ellen DeGeneres Show!'" she said in an interview weeks after her appearance. "Instead I got greeted by an angry intern, who was a bit overworked. I expected a Disney show, but I got a Teletubbies after dark."Ellen has also been slammed by unnamed members of her TV crew, who are disappointed about salary cuts and a lack of communication during the coronavirus shutdown, during which the talk show host has been virtually interviewing famous friends like Pink, Melissa McCarthy, and Jennifer Lopez.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ellen DeGeneres' ex-bodyguard claims star is 'cold' and 'sly'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ellen DeGeneres’ former bodyguard claimed the star’s TV persona is a ‘false facade and bravado.’
Her former security, Tom Majercak, was assigned to protect the comedian at the 2014 Oscars and according to him, his experience felt ‘demeaning.’
Speaking to Fox News, Tom explained: ‘I’m holding their hands and walking them through individuals and large groups of people. Ellen is the one person that I’ve been assigned to – and I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities – that has never taken the time to say hi to me.
‘It started going negatively when she introduced me to Ellen and Ellen pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn’t even say “hello,” or “thank you for protecting my mother, my wife and me.”
‘It was very cold and it was very sly and it was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.’
He went on to say that he thought Ellen was ‘enlightened and positive’ when he saw her on TV, but it wasn’t the case in person.
Tom looked after her during the same Academy Award show the famous celebrity selfie was taken, which included Jennifer Lawrence, Meryl Streep, Kevin Spacey, Luptia Nyongo Bradley Cooper, Channing Tatum, Julia Roberts, Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt.
‘When you see her on TV, people fall in love with her but it is a false facade and bravado,’ he continued.  ‘You start hearing these stories and I was like, “Man, there’s got to be more to this.”
‘She’s not the person she portrays to be that she’s playing off of society. That’s my opinion.’
His coming forward comes after many staff members of her talk show slammed her for failing to communicate the status of their jobs and pay amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Beauty blogger NikkieTutorials also hit out at Ellen, saying the host ‘didn’t even say hello’ when she appeared on the show in January.
The beauty guru – real name Nikkie de Jager – came out as transgender earlier this year, with her first interview afterwards.
However, Ellen has previously slammed claims about how she treats staff, calling it an ‘outright lie.’
‘That bugs me if someone is saying that because it’s an outright lie,’ she told the New York Times in 2018.
‘The first day I said: “The one thing I want is everyone here to be happy and proud of where they work, and if not, don’t work here.” No one is going to raise their voice or not be grateful. That’s the rule to this day.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ellen DeGeneres’ former bodyguard slams her as ‘cold’ and ‘demeaning’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ellen DeGeneres’ former bodyguard has slammed her as “cold” and “demeaning”.
Tom Majercak was hired to protect the talk show host while she hosted the 2014 Oscars, and he also shadowed Ellen’s mother, and her wife Portia de Rossi.
Speaking to Fox News, Tom said it was one of the worst jobs he’s ever signed up for, in the ten years he’s worked in security.
He said: “Ellen is the one person that I’ve been assigned to, and I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities, that has never taken the time to say hi to me.”
Although Tom said Portia was “very pleasant and carried on a conversation”, he couldn’t say the same for Ellen.
He said: “[She] pretty much just gave me a side glance out of her eye and didn’t even say ‘hello,’ or ‘thank you for protecting my mother, my wife and me.’”
“It was very cold and it was very sly and it was actually kind of demeaning in the way that she treats people other than those who are in her circle.”
“It’s bugged me for years. I see this person come across as being very enlightened and positive and awesome. And everybody loves her and is in awe and that’s really not the case when you meet her in person,” he said.
“When you see her on TV, people fall in love with her but it is a false facade and bravado. You start hearing these stories and I was like, ‘Man, there’s got to be more to this.’
“She’s not the person she portrays to be that she’s playing off of society. That’s my opinion,” he added.
The news comes after Ellen was criticised by staff members over lack of communication about their pay amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Production on The Ellen Show halted in March, and Ellen has since been hosting the show from her house.
A source told Variety: “Radio silence from producers created anxiety among crew members who feared they would be furloughed and, in that case, would need to explore unemployment benefits.”
Staff were also furious over Ellen hiring a non-union company to help her produce the show from her house, when her usual crew members have the same skills and are currently out of work.
The chat show host also hit headlines for all the wrong reasons last month, when YouTube star NikkieTutorials called her “cold” after she appeared on The Ellen Show earlier this year.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A bodyguard who looked after Ellen DeGeneres at the 2014 Academy Awards has spoken out about the talk show host, saying that the experience of working with her was “kind of demeaning.”
Bodyguard Tom Majercak said that he was hired to guard Ellen, her mother and her wife Portia de Rossi at the ceremony, which she was hosting, and at events before and after.
He told Fox News that he has worked with a number of high-profile clients but that he did not find the talk show host to be especially friendly.
“Ellen is the one person that I’ve been assigned to – and I’ve been assigned to quite a few celebrities – that has never taken the time to say hi to me,” he said.
He said that he and Portia de Rossi carried on a pleasant and friendly conversation but that things “started going negatively” when he spoke to the host. He continued:
He claimed that he was inspired to say something about his experience after seeing various stories about Ellen circulating online in recent months:
Dutch beauty YouTuber Nikkie de Jager, otherwise known as NikkieTutorials, recently spoke about her own experience on Ellen’s show, calling her “cold and distant.”
Let’s also never forget this iconic interview with Dakota Johnson, in which the pair squared off about whether the hos was or was not invited to Johnson’s birthday party:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Peter Andre jokes Joe Exotic is Junior's dad after sharing embarrassing mullet shot</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Peter Andre refuses to let up when it comes to teasing son Junior about his hair.
Like all kids his age, the 14-year-old has to make sure his look is just right - and doesn't need his dad adding to the pressure.
But after saying the teen's new lockdown do made him look like US rapper Eminem when he shared a moody selfie on Instagram, Pete has gone in once more.
The singer is back again - and reminded the boy of when he looked a lot like a young Joe Exotic.
Pete returned to Insta late on Saturday night to wade in again.
Uploading a half-and-half shot of Junior when he was very little and the Jungle King, he captioned it: "Dad....is that you?"
Then he signed off the post with the hashtag #weneedtotalkaboutcarole - a reference to wacky Joe's obsession with tiger rival Carole Baskin.
Fans loved the sweet pic of Junior, who the star shares with former glamour model Katie Price.
"Some DNA testing is required here," said one in the comments.
Another wrote: "Pete Baskin has a ring to it - just saying!"
He has already been poking his son and on Saturday said his very short new cut made him look like Eminem.
Junior could be seen looking down at his phone as he posed in a bathroom wearing a dark blue Hugo Boss hoody.
In response Pete, 47, joked that his son looked like the rapper and tagged him in a hilarious comment.
He wrote: "Loved your last album @eminem"
He then continued to rib his son in the comments section, writing: "Can’t believe Eminem had someone break in his home do people have no respect don’t understand why people do things like this x"
Katie was overwhelmed after she saw children Princesss and Junior again after six weeks apart.
The brother and sister have been staying at Peter Sussex mansion during lockdown, along with step-mum Emily and their half siblings Amelia and Theo.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drake has finally opened up about the reason he shared pictures of his son online, after keeping him out of the public eye for the first two years of his life.
Last month the Canadian rapper took to Instagram to share pictures of his blonde, curly haired and blue-eyed toddler Adonis, who he parents with former adult star Sophie Brussaux.
Now, he reveals to Lil Wayne why he chose to end the secrecy.
“It wasn’t even anything I talked to anybody about or anything I planned. I just woke up one morning, and I was like, you know what? This is just something that I want to do,” said Drake.
“I want to be able to go places with my son and share memories with my son. I don’t want to feel like just because of a life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I got to make everybody live under this blanket. I just wanted to free myself of that.”
The rapper said it was “great for me” to be able to do that. His comments aired on the second episode of ‘Young Money Radio’, Lil Wayne’s show.
The world first learnt of Drake’s son in 2018, when rapper Pusha T released a diss track against him titled ‘The Story of Adidon’, exposing that Drake had been hiding a child.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake 'feels great' sharing son with the world as he opens up on fatherhood</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drake revealed he felt ‘great’ sharing his son with the world.
The rapper confirmed back in June 2018 that he had son Adonis, with Sophie Brussaux, and he explained it felt ‘freeing’ to be able to tell everyone.
Speaking to fellow rapper Lil Wayne on Young Money Radio, he said: ‘It was great for me. It was great to just share that with the world and I just felt like… it wasn’t even anything I talked to anybody about or anything I planned.
‘I just woke up one morning and I was like, you know what? This is just something that I want to do.’
‘I want to be able to go places with my son and share memories with my son. I don’t want to feel like just because of a life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I got to make everybody live under this blanket.
‘So, I just wanted to free myself of that.’
Drake later stated that it was ‘inspiring’ to see his labelmates, such as Lil Wayne, being able to focus on music and look after their children at the same time, and has credited the Young Money record label for allowing him to do the same.
‘I’ve watched you be a functioning rap father for years, an incredible father,’ he told Wayne. ‘And that gave me a lot of confidence too.
‘A lot of us, like [2] Chainz, is a great father and a lot of the guys that we came up around just being great family men on those yours and on those long studio nights when albums need to get done.
‘But specifically you, just how you always just made that s**t function and work and how much love the people in your life have for you.’
He added: ‘And I could just tell the way your kids would stare at you that the time and effort that you put in as a father.
‘So, that was really inspiring for me just to know that I can still keep pushing forward as a musician and be there for my son.’
In the meantime, Drake has released an album of leaks and one-off tracks called the Dark Line Demo Tapes – and has teased he could drop a new studio album this summer.
He’s really spoiling us.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake Opens Up About The Reason He Finally Decided To Introduce His Son Adonis To The World Two Years After Welcoming Him!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During a chat with Lil Wayne on the newest episode of ‘Young Money Radio,’ Drake opened up about parenthood as well as his new music. The rapper explained, among other things, why he finally decided to introduce his son, Adonis to the world!
As you probably remember, Drake took everyone by surprise when he shared the first pics of his child after previously trying to keep him more of a secret.
Also as a complete surprise, he dropped his mixtape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes not too long ago so during his sit down with the fellow rapper, Drake made sure to talk about the tracks while also discussing his role as a dad to his 2-year-old son, Adonis.
The hitmaker posted the very first pics of the toddler on his Instagram account on March 30 and now he dished that ‘It was great for me. It was great to share that with the world and just felt like … It was not even anything I talked to anyone about or anything that I planned. I just woke up one morning and was like, ‘you know what? This is something that I want to do.’ I wanna be able to go places with my son and to share memories with my son.’
‘I do not want to feel like because of the life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I have to make everyone live under this blanket too. So, I wanted to free myself of that. And I’ve watched you [Lil Wayne] be a functioning rap father for years, an incredible father,’ he went on to say.
Drake also mentioned that other rappers, including Lil Wayne himself, have inspired him to always strive to be a great dad.
‘A lot of the guys that we came up around [were] great family men on those tours and on those long studio nights when albums need to get done,’ he mentioned in part.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Peter Andre compares Junior, 14, to Eminem as he pokes fun at son’s brooding selfie</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PETER Andre hilariously compares his son Junior, 14, to Eminem as he pokes fun at the teen’s brooding selfie.
The singer left a comment on Junior’s Instagram snap and his fans loved the adorable interaction.
Peter is proving to be a typical dad as he embarrasses his child on social media.
The dad-of-four couldn’t resist poking fun at his eldest son on Instagram after the teen posted a moody snap of him looking in the bathroom mirror.
He wrote next to his son’s photo: “I loved your last album @eminem”
Almost hearing the eye roll, Junior replied: “jokeman”
Just last Pete shared a video of Junior rapping along to a track in his kitchen tonight, despairing: "What is he doing?"
Then, pointing out a pink case that had been strewn on the floor, he asked, in true exasperated-dad fashion: "And why is this on the floor?"
In the background Junior is seen swinging his arm to US rapper Logic singing: "Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses, everybody livin' on the surface."
Peter, perhaps disappointed his son wasn't reciting the lyrics to his No1 hit Mysterious Girl, shouted over at him in bewilderment.
The singer has been running around after his children at their Surrey home for weeks now as wife Emily works on the NHS front line as a junior doctor.
And it's a full house at the moment with Junior and Princess, 12 - his children with ex-wife Katie Price, staying at his alongside Amelia, six, and Theo, three - his kids with Emily.
He has often posted video of him cleaning the place up, recently sharing Stacey Solomon-style before-and-after videos of the mess and his home looking gleaming afterwards.
Earlier this month it seemed that Pete was at his wit's end as he tried to homeschool and look after his kids.
He shared a video where youngest son Theo apparently flipped his dad the bird, while Princess twerked to the song Bubble Butt.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake Reveals Why He Finally Decided To Post Photos Of Son Adonis, 2: ‘It Was Great For Me’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drake surprised us all when he dropped his mixtape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes, and he sat down with rapper Lil Wayne on Apple Music’s Young Money Radio to discuss the new tracks, and his role as a father. The “God’s Plan” hitmaker has a two-year-old son, Adonis, who he posted pictures of for the very first time on his Instagram page on March 30. “I posted those pictures. It was great for me. It was great to just share that with the world and I just felt like … It wasn’t even anything I talked to anybody about or anything I planned,” he dished on episode two of Lil Wayne’s talkback show.
“I just woke up one morning and I was like, ‘you know what? This is just something that I want to do’,” Drake continued. “I want to be able to go places with my son and share memories with my son. I don’t want to feel like just because of a life choice I made to be a ‘celebrity’ that I got to make everybody live under this blanket. So, I just wanted to free myself of that. And I’ve watched you [Lil Wayne] be a functioning rap father for years, an incredible father.” Drake also admitted how much the “Lollipop” singer, and other rappers like 2 Chainz have inspired him to be a better father.
“A lot of the guys that we came up around [were] great family men on those tours and on those long studio nights when albums need to get done,” he said. “But specifically you, just how you always just made s**t function and work and how much love the people in your life have for you. And I could just tell the way your kids would stare at you that the time and effort that you put in as a father. So, that was really inspiring for me just to know that I can still keep pushing forward as a musician and be there for my son.”
Drake also talked about his new music, which he announced on Instagram on April 30. The mixtape not only includes a cheeky reference to Kylie Jenner’s billionaire net worth, but also boasts features from Chris Brown (“Not You Too“), Future (“Desires”), and Playboi Carti (“Pain 1993”). The overall mixtape was a joint effort between Drake and his “brothers,” Oliver El-Khatib (co-founder of Drake’s record label OVO) and producer Noel Cadastre. “My brothers put together a lot of the songs people have been asking for (some leaks and some joints from SoundCloud and some new vibes),” Drake explained.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cristiano Ronaldo splashes out on new car for his mum on Mother's Day</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cristiano Ronaldo spared no expense on Mother’s Day this year.
The footballer splashed out on a brand new car for his mum Dolores Aveiro for the special day in Portugal.
Dolores shared a picture of the Mercedes which she got from her children on Instagram.
Her caption read: ‘Thank you to my children for the gifts I received today. Happy Mother’s Day.’
In the picture she held a bunch of flowers and stood next to the black vehicle, which had a giant red bow around it.
Ronaldo also marked the special day by paying tribute to Maria and the mother of his children Georgina Rodriguez.
Posting pictures of them both on Instagram Cristiano said: ‘Happy Mother’s Day to my two special women.’
Last month Dolores, 65, was rushed to hospital after suffering a stroke.
In good spirits, she joked that she was ‘complaining a lot about being left in bed for hours on end’ adding ‘I know it’s for my own good.’
At the time she shared that she is ‘recovering well’.
Cristiano had flown to Madeira by private jet with Georgina and eldest son Cristiano Jr.
The footballer is also dad to daughter Alana, who he shares with Georgina, and two-year-old twins Eva and Mateo.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Celebs honour Gianna Bryant on would-be 14th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">On Friday, Gianna Bryant would have turned 14, and mum Vanessa Bryant — plus a host of celebrities — took the chance to celebrate in a special way.
Vanessa posted an image to Instagram wearing a red bracelet that holds her daughter’s name and her nickname ‘mambacita’, with a heart in between.
“Gianna loved to wear a red bow in all of her school pictures. Red means love and life,” explained Vanessa in the caption. “To commemorate Gigi’s birthday today, please consider wearing red, caption an act of kindness or show how you will play Gigi’s way since she always gave everything she did her all and led with kindness.”
She hashtagged the post #PlayGigisWay, likely a reference to her late daughter’s affinity for basketball. Vanessa also said the bracelets would be available for sale soon, with proceeds going toward the Mamba and Mambacita foundation.
A host of celebrities took to Instagram wearing the bracelet and honouring Gianna, who died alongside her father and basketball icon Kobe Bryant, 41, in a helicopter accident in January.
Lakers star LeBron James led the wishes, posting a video of himself wearing the bracelet to his Instagram story, and writing: “Happy beauty-day niece Gigi!!”
Jennifer Lopez and fiance Alex ‘A-Rod’ Rodriguez took a family photo with their children, while all sporting the red bracelet.
“Happy Birthday, Gigi. We miss you. You are always in our hearts,” wrote the retired baseball player Rodriguez. “Today we wore these red bracelets in honour of you, to symbolise love and life. I think of you, Mambacita, and your dad everyday. We love you.”
Kim Kardashian West and sister Khloe Kardashian also posted tributes to their Instagram stories, wearing the bracelets.
“Happy birthday Gigi!!! We all love you so much!” wrote Khloe. “You always led with kindness and love. Today and everyday, thank you for inspiring us to be better.”
Kelly Clarkson joined in, sharing a personal memory.
“I remember Kobe telling me that Gigi always played with kindness, not just talent! I wear this bracelet to honour her on her birthday and remind everyone to continue her legacy and #PlayGigisWay,” wrote Clarkson, using the hashtag that Vanessa created for the occasion.
Ciara and her husband, football quarterback Russell Wilson, shared an image of their hands overlapping, while they both donned the red wristband.
“Happy Birthday Mambacita Gi Gi,” wrote the ‘1, 2 Step’ singer and dancer. “Today I’m going to do a little dance for you because I know you loved dancing. We love you.”
Actress Zendaya shared a wordless image of her wearing the bracelet, with an extra heart drawn on top.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kim Kardashian was among major celebrities who celebrated Gigi Bryant’s 14th birthday on Friday.
It’s been three months since the teenager tragically died alongside her father Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash in Calabasas in January.
To mark what would have been Gigi’s 14th birthday on Friday, a host of famous faces wore red bracelets, which were created by her mother Vanessa to support the Mamba and Mamacita Foundation.
Sharing a photo of the bracelet on Instagram, Vanessa told fans: “Gianna loved to wear a red bow in all of her school pictures. Red means love and life.”
“To commemorate Gigi’s birthday today, please consider wearing red, caption an act of kindness or show how you will play Gigi’s way since she always gave everything she did her all and led with kindness.”
Vanessa added: “We are in the process of making this bracelet available for proceeds to benefit our Mamba and Mambacita foundation. I will update you with a post when we have them available for purchase.”
Kim Kardashian shared a selfie of her wearing the bracelet on Instagram, and added the hashtag #playgigisway.
Jennifer Lopez and her fiancé Alex Rodriguez also paid tribute to Gigi by wearing the bracelets.
Posing alongside Jennifer’s kids Max and Emme, and his daughters Natasha and Ella, A-Rod wrote: “Happy birthday Gigi. We miss you. You are always in our hearts.”
“Today we wore these red bracelets in honor of you, to symbolize love and life. I think of you. Mambacita, and your dad everyday. We love you. #PlayGigisWay.”
Khloe Kardashian also shared a selfie of her wearing two red bracelets, and wrote: “Happy birthday Gigi. We all love you so much! #Playgigisway.”
“You always led with kindness and love. Today and everyday, thank you for inspiring us to be better.”
Celebrities got involved by wishing Gigi a happy birthday, after her mother Vanessa posted a heartbreaking tribute on Instagram.
Posting a photo of Gigi just months before her death, Vanessa wrote: “Happy 14th Birthday to my sweet baby girl, Gianna.”
“Mommy loves you more than I can ever show you. You are part of MY SOUL forever. I miss you so much everyday. I wish I could wake up and have you here with me. I miss your smile, your hugs and your giggles.”
“I miss EVERYTHING about YOU, Gigi. I LOVE YOU so much!!!!!” she added.
Gigi and Kobe were killed in a helicopter crash on January 26, alongside seven other victims.
They were on their way to the Mamba Academy in Thousand Oaks, California for basketball practice when the helicopter encountered thick fog and crashed.
Kobe and Gigi are survived by Vanessa, and Gigi’s siblings Natalie, 17, Bianka, 3, and seven-month-old Capri.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Eddie Marsan recruits family to film TV scenes during lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Eddie Marsan has tackled the challenge of appearing in a new TV series while in lockdown by recruiting his family as film crew and performers.
The Happy Go Lucky star and his wife Janine juggled home-schooling their four children while capturing his scenes for ITV’s Isolation Stories, a four-part drama about families during the coronavirus pandemic.
Covid-19 outbreak restrictions saw Janine step behind the camera for the first time to help capture her husband’s performance while two of their children joined in the acting.
Marsan – whose career has seen him directed by Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and Mike Leigh – hailed his wife’s directorial debut.
He told the BBC Andrew Marr show on Sunday: “She was fantastic, she really took it on. She was moving the cameras, moving the lights, doing the sounds, cooking the lunches, everything.”
Janine explained she was given technical support by director David Blair and others via the video conferencing platform Zoom, but said she did not think she would start a new film career.
Marsan explained that he is due to appear in an episode entitled Karen, which sees him play a “heartbroken” man whose marriage has collapsed and is self-isolating at home with his two teenage sons.
His ex-partner’s father, played by actor David Threlfall, comes to his house to persuade him to let his former wife see the children.
Due to strict social-distancing rules, Threlfall had to remain in the Marsan family garden while performing his scenes.
“The whole premise is to tell stories about what’s happening in everyday people’s lives but within the context of isolation and the difficulties that that brings,” Marsan explained.
He said his children had grown up on film sets and he thought the challenge of helping film scenes at home would teach them to collaborate.
“They loved it. It was very hard work and they wanted to get off their school work, but we didn’t let them,” he said.
“So every time we said ‘cut’ and we had to change things, they had to go down and do some more work, and they wanted to just play on the Xbox or something. We didn’t let them.”
Isolation Stories airs at 9pm over four nights on ITV, starting on Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Film fans prepare to ‘feel the force’ on Star Wars Day</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Movie fans around the world are preparing to mark Star Wars Day.
The day is celebrated on May 4 each year with aficionados wearing costumes to show their love of the sci-fi franchise.
Fans refer to the movies’ famous phrase May The Force Be With You by declaring “May the Fourth be with you”.
Last year, after the death of Chewbacca actor Peter Mayhew, his family shared a special message, saying that “May the 4th is a tribute to the scale of Star Wars reach”.
Entertainment giant Disney+ is putting the final instalment in the Skywalker saga, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, on its platform on the day.
The Rise Of Skywalker was released in December and featured a star-studded cast including Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Adam Driver.
It received mixed reviews from critics and holds a 52% score on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.
The film earned just over one billion dollars at the global box office, making it less successful than both The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Film fans prepare to ‘feel the force’ on Star Wars Day</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The day is celebrated on May 4 each year with fans wearing costumes to show their love of the sci-fi franchise.
Movie fans around the world are preparing to mark Star Wars Day.
The day is celebrated on May 4 each year with aficionados wearing costumes to show their love of the sci-fi franchise.
Fans refer to the movies’ famous phrase May The Force Be With You by declaring “May the Fourth be with you”.
Last year, after the death of Chewbacca actor Peter Mayhew, his family shared a special message, saying that “May the 4th is a tribute to the scale of Star Wars reach”.
Entertainment giant Disney+ is putting the final instalment in the Skywalker saga, Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker, on its platform on the day.
The Rise Of Skywalker was released in December and featured a star-studded cast including Daisy Ridley, John Boyega and Adam Driver.
It received mixed reviews from critics and holds a 52% score on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes.
The film earned just over one billion dollars at the global box office, making it less successful than both The Last Jedi and The Force Awakens.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jimmy Fallon's daughters continue to be the cutest part of the at-home edition of The Tonight Show, especially when they crash his celebrity interviews. During Friday's episode with Jon Hamm, Jimmy's 6-year-old, Winnie, snuck on screen to chat with her dad, and taught Jon a thing or two about farm animals.
"Uh-oh, special guest star!" Jon adorably joked when Winnie greeted her dad. She didn't seemed fazed by their chat at all, and instead showed off her farm animals book to Jon. "This is not a book, it's a coloring book," she corrected Jon before giving him a lesson on pigs and cows. Watch the adorable interaction above. Jimmy said it took homeschooling for Winnie to learn finally that she's not a chicken. Hey, we've all been there.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jimmy Fallon’s Daughter Hilariously Crashes Interview With Jon Hamm</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jon Hamm zoomed in for a chat with Jimmy Fallon on Friday’s “At-Home” edition of “The Tonight Show”, but their conversation was derailed when Fallon’s 6-year-old daughter, Winnie, crashed the interview.
Winnie brought along a colouring book featuring farm animals, which prompted some animal-related questions from the “Mad Men” star.
“That’s a really pretty cow,” declared Hamm of the coloured pig that Winnie displayed, and she corrected him by turning to another page featuring a bovine. “That’s a cow,” she told him.
“Ehh, that’s a lamb,” he said, causing Winnie to seriously doubt Hamm’s knowledge of livestock while reminding viewers that she is “not a chicken.”
During another segment of the interview, Hamm took viewers on a tour of his office and teased a “Mad Men” reunion in the near future to raise money for charity. Watch:

Vulture’s honorary husband was delighted at the brief interruption (“special guest star!”), and as a win-win, we also got to learn about his current livestock preferences. (You forgot he’s a nice Missouri boy, didn’t you?) “Is there a duck? What about a chicken? Duck or chicken,” Hamm demands, “anything with a beak.” Cattle is a close second, and don’t you dare mention swine. He has enough Hamm as it is.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Katie Price reveals she needs therapy for life after ‘slowly going off the rails for 10 years’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KATIE Price claims she needs therapy for life as she comes to terms with 'going off the reals' in a clip from her new TV show.
The 41-year-old doesn't hold back in the hour-long special of My Crazy Life, telling viewers she's been to "hell and back".
In a teaser clip, she says: "I've been slowly going off the rails for just over 10 years.
"At times I've been a mess. I've been to hell and back, but I'm starting to feel like me again.
"Four weeks in hospital and some intense therapy that will continue for the rest of my life has got me back to being me.
"It just goes to show, if I can do it, anyone can!"
Katie recently revealed to The Sun Online how she burst into tears after being reunited with children Princess and Junior after six weeks apart.
The mum-of-five has suffered a tough time being separated from her kids in lockdown amid the coronavirus crisis.
The family were forced apart after Junior, 14, showed signs of the deadly bug while staying with his dad Peter Andre.
This week she was finally able to see him and 12-year-old Princess again.
Katie told us: “I can't believe how much the kids have grown in six weeks - Pete's had them sleeping in grow bags!
"I welled up, it’s been a tough six weeks not being able to hug them.
"After five minutes together it was back to the usual fun and craziness."
Meanwhile Katie has been staying with pals at a posh pad in Surrey - just ten minutes away from Peter - as she isolates with her eldest son Harvey.
She has been shielding the disabled 17-year-old from danger because he is at high-risk from coronavirus because of his health condition.
Her youngest kids Jett and Bunny have been living with their dad Kieran Hayler and his fiancee Michelle Penticost.
Junior and Princess have spent the last six weeks with Peter and his wife Emily - who is an A&E doctor battling coronavirus on the frontline.
It has meant Katie's kids haven't been able to all be together since lockdown began.
"It’s been hardest on Harvey because he really misses the contact with his siblings," Katie added.
"Fingers crossed we’ll be a complete unit with Jett and Bunny joining us this weekend.
"My children are my perfect pieces of heaven - they have kept me strong through thick and thin.
"Unconditional love is free and means everything to me.”
The 41-year-old reality star posted a cute video last night of Harvey, Princess and Junior clapping the NHS on their doorstep.
"It’s Thursday, so let’s show our appreciation and respect for all the incredible key workers keeping our country going", she told fans.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jon Gosselin Blasts Ex-Wife Kate For Not Working As A Nurse During Pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Victoria Miller
'I have no idea what she's doing for work,' the former 'Jon and Kate Plus 8' star said of his ex.
Jon Gosselin is slamming his ex-wife Kate Gosselin for not going back to her career in the nursing field amid the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
In a new interview, the former Jon and Kate Plus 8 star told The Sun that he is unsure how his ex is making a living more than a year after she filmed her last reality shows for TLC. He also noted the 45-year-old mom of eight’s social media silence. Kate has not posted to Instagram since last October when her final Kate Plus 8 special aired.
“It’s like she’s gone MIA for a while,” Jon said of Kate. “I have no idea what she’s doing for work. I mean you think – as she claims she has her nursing license – that she’d be on the front line. That would be a good idea. Just saying.”
Jon questioned that if Kate still has a nursing license, why isn’t she doing something to help during this unprecedented health epidemic.
The outlet notes that Kate’s still-active nursing license expires at the end of 2021.
In the interview, Jon pointed out that there people coming out of retirement to help at hospitals, and he went on praise his longtime girlfriend Colleen Conrad for her own “calling” as a nurse as has continues to put herself at risk on the frontlines as a mental health practitioner during the pandemic.
“And then you talk, like my ex-wife, ‘Well I was a nurse and this and that’. So there’s people that talk about it and then there’s people that talk about it and actually do it,” the former reality star said.
Jon also noted that he is also in a high-risk job. The reality TV dad, who has custody of two of his kids, Hannah and Collin, 15, said his work in the IT field has him going into hospital and clinical settings on a daily basis.
“I’m here, I go on the floor, I fix printers in infected rooms,” Jon said. “Maybe I touch keyboards that might be infected. I just put my hand sanitizer on and put a mask on. It is what it is. It’s your job, you got to do what you gotta do.”
Jon revealed that he even bought a tent in case he or Colleen become infected with the virus and gave to quarantine away way from their children.
Jon has been vocal about his girlfriend’s achievements in her career and previously described Colleen as “driven,” per People. Colleen earned her Master’s in Nursing from Drexel University in 2017.
Meanwhile, before she shot to fame on Jon and Kate Plus 8, Kate worked at the Reading Hospital and Medical Center as a labor and delivery room nurse, according to The New York Daily News. Kate left her nursing career to raise her eight kids, and TLC came calling with a reality show deal.
Kate never went back to her original career. Following her 2009 divorce from Jon, she has starred in Kate Plus 8, competed on ABC’s Dancing with the Stars and on the Donald Trump-hosted Celebrity Apprentice, and headlined a TLC dating show spinoff, Kate Plus Date.
As the coronavirus pandemic rages on, Kate and six of her kids have been quarantining at their home in Pennsylvania. The mom of eight was last seen in one of her daughter Mady’s TikTok videos in March.

The My Crazy Life star, 41, has shared another preview of her one off special for her fly-on-the-wall series on Quest Red.
The emotional clip sees her have a reunion with her mother, whilst airing some honest reflections about her current life situation.
She captioned the clip on her Instagram page: "Before the lockdown began, I went to visit my mum for a chat through the window."

"At times I've been a mess. I've been to hell and back, but I'm starting to feel like me again."
The mother of five also made a gut-wrenching admission about how precarious her mental health is likely to remain for the rest of her days, but she is hopeful for the future.
She "Four weeks in hospital and some intense therapy that will continue for the rest of my life has got me back to being me."
"It just goes to show, if I can do it, anyone can!"
A previous clip released for the episode saw her discuss her confidence in displaying the real her to the world after her stint in rehab.
In a short clip, Katie yells: "Not only am I back in the room, not only am I doing my music, I am going to let everyone see who the real f**king Katie Price is, bring it on!"
She later confessed: "There's only so much I can take as a human being. Everything just got to me.
"The only reason I'm sitting here now is because of my children."
Katie has five children: Harvey with Dwight Yorke, Junior Savva Andreas and Princess Tiaamii Crystal Esther with first husband Peter Andre, and Jett Riviera and Bunny with third husband Kieran Hayler.
She split from her fiancé Kris Boyson last year.
Katie Price: My Crazy Life returns on Monday at 10pm on Quest Red.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Halle Berry, 53, used some of her time in quarantine to use a hair product she loves and showed off a stunning photo of herself to promote it. The actress shared a snapshot that showed her standing in front of a shower with wet curly locks and no makeup while taking a selfie with her phone and her all natural look is definitely a beautiful sight to see. “Settling in on this fine #SelfCareSaturday with a much needed #HairMask, courtesy of my girl @tarajiphenson’s new line of hair care products, @tphbytaraji . I’ve known this woman since she started in the industry, and it’s been such a joy to watch her flourish and succeed. Obsessed with this line, check my stories for a few of my favorites! ♥️” Halle captioned the pic. 
Once Halle’s pic went public, her followers couldn’t help but gush over her incredible beauty and even complimented her on her support of other women. “Gorgeous. Women supporting women! 👏” one follower wrote while another wrote, “No matter what you do you look good.” Others left hearts and heart-eyed emojis to show their support.
Before her latest quarantine pic, Halle shared many other pics of herself during her time at home and throwback pics as well, including one on May 1. It showed her posing in a sheer black lingerie-style outfit that showed off her incredible figure as she put her hands up on her head. “Ahhhhh the simpler times,” she captioned the pic, most likely referring to the times when quarantine due to the coronavirus wasn’t in effect.
It’s always awesome to see pics of Halle in and out of quarantine. We’re happy she’s staying healthy and positive and hope to see more moments soon.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kandi Burruss looks drop-dead gorgeous for the Virtual Reunion of RHOA, despite the fact that she’s not having her glam look to help her out. Her look was definitely a flawless one as you will see in the photo below.
‘I had to do my own glam for #RHOA reunion since we’re in quarantine. I miss my glam family… 😩 Doing my own hair & makeup was a struggle. I tried! I used @kandikoatedcosmetics on the beat! I love my fit from @albinadylaofficial .Make sure to watch the reunion May 10 on @bravotv!’ Kandi captioned her post.
Someone believes that ‘#kandi You look better when you do it yourself, chile!’ and one other fan praised Kandi, saying: ‘@kandi you still look the best at the reunion!!!’
Another commenter said: ‘For some reason, this all feels so phony!! No one keeps it real on this show and I use to be a true super fan!!’
One person responded with: ‘I agree I’m not a big fan like I use to be either. Her spirit is nasty. it’s probably with all that Mama Joyce drama was really bringing stuff out but I’m not feeling her this season.’
One follower praised Kandi’s look and told her: ‘You did a great job with your makeup 💄 you still slayed!! I’m rooting for you all the way. Love you @kandi 👸🏽♥️ Oh yea and FYI, please take my advice and keep Porsha at arm’s length. Look at her and Kenya. This entire season she’s been acting like she’s over the drama with @thekenyamoore and it seems like every time someone went against Kenya this season she was so anxious to be on the opposite end and go against her. It’s sad, I know reality tv is mostly drama but that doesn’t mean it should be fake af and not authentic.’
Another commenter made sure to praise Kandi as well, but not without throwing some shade for other RHOA ladies: ‘You did a great job unlike some that looked casket ready.’
Do you like Kandi’s look for the RHOA season 12 Virtual Reunion?

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Advertisement -
Cosmetics mogul Kylie Jenner is enjoying her quarantine time with new hair and makeup makeovers. Her latest look is stunning. The reality star looked great with an ombre ponytail that she featured in a video on her Instagram account on Wednesday. The model also collects a huge number of hairpieces and extensions. Kylie has shown several looks over the past week such as a straight blond look as well as a tie-back ponytail. She has also appeared without her extensions, showing her natural hair at shoulder-length.
The mother-of-one said that the reason why she changes her look so often is that it is an addiction that makes her feel like a new person. Sharing in a post, the Lip Kits founder said that she first coloured her hair when she was 16. She had it coloured blue and she did not tell her mother. Since then, she has been addicted to changing her hairstyle. It makes her feel like a new person and she loves feeling different. Kylie added that she loves leaving the house knowing that nobody has ever seen her this way.
Kylie moved into a new home in Holmby Hills, Los Angeles during the quarantine period.

This week, she and her best friend Stassie created a series for TikTok and recreated funny Keeping Up with the Kardashian clips. The massive residence was shown in the clips, with the amazing swimming pool as well as teasers into the gym and cinema. Prior to her new abode, Kylie lived with her mother Kris Jenner in Hidden Hills. The model also has a house in that neighbourhood. Kylie and her daughter Stormi seem to be enjoying themselves with Kris as Kylie shared videos of them in the mansion. There are clips of them dressing up for a TikTok video, as well as Stormi playing in the swimming pool. Kylie uploaded a funny video of Kris sleeping in the living room in the middle of the day too. /TISG

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jessica Chastain Shows Off Her Belly Dancing Skills In A Red Bra Dripping With Gold Coins</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
Jessica got poked in the head by a plant while she was shaking her hips.
Jessica Chastain gave her fans an inside look at an entertaining belly dancing lesson in a video that she uploaded to Instagram on Thursday. The 43-year-old Interstellar star made sure to dress appropriately for her crash course in moving her midsection. She was rocking a vibrant red bra top that left her taut tummy exposed.
The award-winning actress didn’t reveal when her belly dancing class took place. She also didn’t share the exact location of her performance, but her video was filmed on a patio surrounded by pink stucco walls and palm trees. It was shaded by a thatched roof.
Before she began swaying her hips and twirling around, Jessica informed her instructor that she actually belly danced in a play once. However, she said that it was so long ago that she didn’t remember anything about the art form.
The bra top Jessica was wearing for her refresher course featured an attached netted bib. The top of the bib was trimmed with gold paillettes that were layered like scales. A large number of gold coins hung from gold beaded strings on the bottom of the bib.
Jessica was rocking a matching belly dance belt over a sheer red skirt. Underneath the lightweight garment, she was wearing a pair of black leggings. She completed her ensemble with a pair of white sneakers with thick rubber soles.
Jessica accessorized her outfit with a pair of over-sized sunglasses. She was wearing her shoulder-length red hair down and styled in glamorous curls.
The Help star was shown wiggling her hips from side-to-side to make the coins on her belt shake and jingle. She also jumped up and down, wiggled her backside, and worked on her arm movements. As the video progressed, she began mastering her shimmies, twists, and hip lifts and drops. However, disaster almost struck when Jessica was holding her skirt in front of her face like a veil. She ran into one of the sharp leaves of a palm plant, and the tip pricked her forehead.
“Do I have blood?” she asked whoever was behind the camera.
However, the incident didn’t stop Jessica’s lesson, and she had her instructor praising her by the time it was over.
Jessica’s teacher told her that she was “good, girl.”
“I haven’t been told that often that I’m a good girl,” Jessica replied. “That was a sexy joke.”
Jessica’s Instagram followers were also impressed by her moves.
“Hips don’t lie,” read one response to her video.
“I love this video so much!” another fan wrote.
“This is gold!!!!! You are always impressive,” a third admirer wrote.
As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Jessica’s fans were similarly delighted last month when she treated them to a series of saucy snapshots from a steamy GQ photo shoot.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We aren’t complaining about Kiara Advani’s shimmery silver affair, a gorgeous photoshoot that she did for Hello Magazine before the lockdown. The pictures from the photoshoot were out and it’s hard not to crush on the gorgeous girl.
One phrase to describe her in the shimmery outfit is ‘drop-dead gorgeous’. The Manish Malhotra’s outfit teamed with alluring makeup by Lekha Gupta and hairstyling by stylist Amit Thakur took her gorgeous look to another level.
Not always, the outfit, makeup, jewellery and hairstyling go in perfect sync with each other and this photoshoot is one of those times when it seemed so. ‘Hello Magazine’ can’t ask for more from stunning Kiara Advani.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Michelle McGahan
Stassie Karanikolaou stunned in Skims on Sunday, May 3, sharing an Instagram photo of herself posing in two pieces from Kim Kardashian’s clothing line.
Stassie, Kylie Jenner‘s best friend, bared her toned midriff in the Skims Cozy Collection ensemble. She wore a toasted brown crop top and shorts, the fuzzy items emphasizing her curves.
She leaned against a cream-colored wall in the image, bending one knee and resting her hands behind her head. Shadows danced behind her, her body reflected on the wall. The picture appeared to be taken at the golden hour, during which the sun starts to set and all objects glimmer with light. Sunlight streamed across Stassie’s face.
The sleeveless crop top was made out of a furry material that seemed to maximize comfort. Though it sported a scoop neckline, Stassie’s chest was entirely covered, no cleavage to be seen. Still, the top accentuated and flattered her buxom bust.
The tiny shorts rode up high on her hips, making her hourglass figure take center stage. The bottoms were made out of the same fabric as the top, and showed off Stassie’s ample assets.
The model’s platinum blond locks slid down her back in straight strands, several stray pieces falling over one shoulder.
She paired the ensemble with two pieces of gold jewelry: A dainty gold cross necklace and her ever-present gold Cartier “Love” bracelet.
Stassie’s arctic blue eyes sparkled in the sun. Her dark brown brows were shaped and arched high over her eyes. She wore a soft orange shadow on her lids, matching her makeup palette with the golden hue of the light. Her lashes were swiped with black mascara.
Her contoured cheeks were brushed with bronzer, making her already sun-kissed skin look even tanner. Her plump pout was filled in with a dusty rose matte shade.
Stassie’s 7.8 million Instagram followers flocked to the comments section of the post in droves, idolizing her beauty and admiring her latest look.
“Gorgeous,” wrote one fan, punctuating their comment with two heart-eye emoji.
“W o w,” gushed another follower.
“Queen,” shared a third social media user, adding two orange hearts.
“Imagine looking like this,” a fourth person wrote.
Others replied with rows of heart-eye, heart, and flame emoji.
As of press time, the image racked up 251,000 likes and over 950 comments.
As Stassie Karanikolaou fans and The Inquisitr readers know, Kylie Jenner recently shared a photo on her own account wearing a pair of Skims that looked seriously similar to these, though the makeup mogul wore pants instead of shorts.

Apart from her work life, she is mostly hitting the headlines for her love affair with Sidharth Malhotra. Although they are yet to come out in open about it, their social media PDA, dinner dates and outings speak volume about their love affair.

    <h5 class="mb-1">All the times Katrina Kaif made a statement with florals</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Katrina Kaif is an actor who’s par excellence. She is well known for her strides in fashion, too. Keeping it simple and chic, it does not come as a surprise that the actor loves her florals. If you are someone who is a fan of the print, too, this is the best time to bookmark her look ranging from lehengas to saris and dresses. Take a look at all the times she turned heads wearing these prints.
In a gorgeous lehenga from the house of Sabyasachi; the white lehenga features floral prints in pink with a majestic drape. It is perfect for a summer wedding. The lehenga was paired with statement golden chaandbaalis and sleek straight hair.
Katrina Kaif looks like a dream in this floral midi dress featuring small floral prints paired with a cropped beige coat. If you are someone who wants to keep it simple, opt for small floral prints. Pro tip: if you want to make people wonder how you lost all of that weight, go for small prints.
Styled by celebrity stylist Ami Patel, the floral sari, a Sabyasachi creation, features black sequined borders. Styled with a black sleeveless blouse and a pair of silver studs, the look was put together with Kaif’s basic makeup.
Hands down, this is our favourite outfit. This one’s too is from Sabyasachi — a stunning baby pink sari featuring flowers in dark pink, it was styled with a full-sleeves blouse. The look was pulled together with a waistband with the same floral print and the Sabyasachi logo. For the accessories, she kept it simple with a pair of dainty earrings.
Making it to the list of perfect brunch outfits, this body con floral dress wins our heart. Keeping it minimal just like the actor always does, she paired it with a pair of silver hoops. The bodycon dress, which features ruffles, was completed with soft brown smokey eyes.
What do you think about her looks?

    <h5 class="mb-1">'It's just scary': Kylie Jenner says the coronavirus hits 'close to home' in the latest KUWTK trailer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“Keeping Up with the Kardashians” won’t be back until September, but a recently released trailer revealed some of the topics the show will be taking on next season, including the coronavirus pandemic.
The trailer, which gives a sneak peek of the show’s 19th season, broaches the topic with a voiceover of Kim who says, “The White House said that the coronavirus is serious,” over ominous music. The trailer also mentions the Los Angeles stay-at-home order, which went into effect on March 19.
It also includes a clip of Kylie Jenner telling the camera that the coronavirus pandemic hits “close to home,” though the clip doesn’t offer any more details into what the Kylie Cosmetics founder meant.
“It’s just scary when someone so close to home has tested positive,” she said.
In recent weeks, many celebrities tested positive for COVID-19, including Tom Hanks, Pink, and Idris Elba.
It appears season 19 will touch on the ways the Kardashian family has been affected by the pandemic. One clip shows Scott Disick saying he’s going a bit stir crazy, and another shows a tearful Kris Jenner telling Khloe over the phone she wishes she could hug her.
The trailer also features non-coronavirus-related clips, including Kris and Disick pulling a prank and the family speculating about whether Khloe has hooked up with ex Tristan Thompson.
“Keeping Up with the Kardashians” will return to E! in September. You can watch the trailer for season 19 here:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Hemsworth said co-star Tiffany Haddish ripped apart a script because it didn't properly portray a strip club</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During a recent interview on The Ellen Show, “Thor” actor Chris Hemsworth talked about the upcoming movie he’s starring in with comedian Tiffany Haddish, and said that working together revealed to him Haddish’s strip-club acumen.
The movie, called “Down Under Cover,” is an action-meets-comedy about a detective duo, Hemsworth and Haddish, who are tasked with shutting down multiple casino heists. Hemsworth’s character has to go undercover as a male stripper because they believe Australian male strippers are running the heists.
“Love her work. She’s hilarious,” Hemsworth said of his co-star. “What I didn’t know was how versed she was in the world of stripping, particularly male stripping, and she’s been to many a male strip club.”
Hemsworth said that once he and Haddish were given their scripts, she immediately “ripped the script apart” because it didn’t portray male strip clubs correctly. She pointed out parts of the plot, saying “this would never happen” and explained what the experience would be like in real life, Hemsworth told Degeneres.
Degeneres said she wasn’t surprised that Haddish was well-versed in strip clubs and said that the production was lucky to have her perspective.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Radio presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford announces baby news</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TV and radio presenter Sarah-Jane Crawford is expecting her first child, with football manager Brian Barry-Murphy.
The host of the Sunday Chart Show on Hits Radio discovered she was pregnant before Christmas, and is due to give birth in early August.
After a difficult first trimester, Crawford said she was feeling “more energised” as she prepared to enter the final stage.
She told Hello! magazine: “We are both over the moon. We found out just before Christmas. It was an incredible present.
“I’ve noticed my body is changing with the seasons. When summer comes it will be the blossoming of everything. It’s an amazing journey.”
Rochdale manager Barry-Murphy, 41, has an eight-year-old daughter from a previous relationship.
Crawford said: “Blending a family is a special thing. I’ve come from a blended family too.
“Brian is very excited to be a dad all over again. He loves being a dad and he knew (being a parent) is something I really wanted, too. It’s a new chapter in our relationship.”
Crawford, who has West African and Irish heritage, said that, having dealt with insecurities, she would be passing on a positive message to her child.
She said: “I had things I hated about myself, like my lips, when I was growing up, but now I’m really proud of my looks.
“I’ll pass on the message to my child that: ‘You’re beautiful.’
“I want them to know that their uniqueness is what makes them special. I want them to feel proud of themselves and of their own natural beauty.
“When it comes to learning to love yourself, I have lots of good life experience to pass on.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: An online shopper in Dubai was left stunned when she ordered fake wireless Apple AirPods from Amazon, and received the device which was even bigger that her head in size.
In a Twitter post, the Dubai user by the name of @Al33rzay said that when she opened the package, the fake AirPods left her speechless
"So today I received my airpods from Amazon. God these are huge," she tweeted.
"I got the AirPods from Amazon last month. I knew they were fake because Amazon sells weird stuff, and it wasn't expensive. I was shocked not going to lie, but we move on," she added.
According to a report in New York Post, the lady spent nearly $62 (Dh227.73) for the fake AirPods, which normally retail for more than three times the price.
Her post featureing a photo of the giant AirPods received more than 72,000 retweets.
Most users compared the fake airpods with a hairdryer.
"Most of you saying it's hairdryer. But I say it's 'eardryer,'" she said.
Amazon did not comment on her tweet or the report but the tweet was deleted later, saying it contains "potentially sensitive content".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Woman orders bogus AirPods off Amazon bigger than her head</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Maybe they’re AirPods for an elephant.
An online shopper in Dubai who ordered fake Apple AirPods on Amazon in March was stunned when she opened the package to find that they are bigger than her head.
“I got the AirPods from Amazon last month,” said Aleezay in Twitter post last week. “I knew they were fake because Amazon sells weird stuff, and it wasn’t expensive. I was shocked not going to lie, but we move on.”
She said she spent the equivalent of $62 for the fake AirPods, which normally retail for more than three times the price. Her post, which features a photo of the giant AirPods, received more than 72,000 retweets.
“Most of you saying it’s hairdryer. But I say it’s ‘eardryer,'” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 17 best sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sometimes you just want to escape your real life and get immersed in the futuristic, mind-bending worlds of science fiction. Luckily, Netflix has you covered.
The streaming site has a strong selection of sci-fi movies to choose from. Standouts include genre classics such as “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” and “The Matrix,” as well as the dimension-hopping superhero film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” There are also numerous science fiction thrillers available to stream, such as “Moon” and “Inception.”
Here are 17 great sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now.
Note: Numerous Netflix titles drop off the service monthly, so the availability of titles below may change.
Insider has many movie and TV show lists to keep you occupied. You can read them all here.
Netflix description: “In a smog-choked dystopian Los Angeles, blade runner Rick Deckard is called out of retirement to snuff a quartet of escaped ‘replicants.'”
Why you should watch: Widely regarded as a sci-fi classic, “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” is equal parts cyberpunk thriller and noir detective story.
Touching on common questions of the genre (such as what it means to be human, and how closely artificial intelligence can copy that humanity), director Ridley Scott’s masterpiece is further enhanced thanks to the final cut’s extra footage not featured in the movie’s theatrical release.
Netflix description: “A computer hacker learns that what most people perceive as reality is actually a simulation created by machines, and joins a rebellion to break free.”
Why you should watch: With its mind-boggling worldbuilding and ambitious, martial arts-inspired action sequences, the Wachowskis’ tech odyssey captivated audiences when it first hit theaters in 1999.
With the recent Keanu Reeves renaissance in full swing thanks to the “John Wick” franchise, the Netflix rom-com “Always Be My Maybe,” and more, now is as good a time as any to get acquainted with one of the actor’s most well-known roles.
Netflix description: “In a near-future world, single people are hunted and forced to find mates within 45 days, or be turned into animals and banished to the wilderness.”
Why you should watch: While the basic premise of “The Lobster” sounds reminiscent of a dystopian version of “The Bachelor,” the film soon morphs into a strangely moving rumination on the struggle to find love in a society rooted in aspirational coupledom.
Fans of director Yorgos Lanthimos’ most recent movie “The Favourite” will likely enjoy the similar brand of absurdist tragicomedy on display here.
Netflix description: “The Earth’s remaining inhabitants are confined to a single train circling the globe as revolution brews among the class-divided cars.”
Why you should watch: “Snowpiercer” has the same sharp class-structure criticisms that defined director Bong Joon Ho’s best picture-winning “Parasite,” delivered within an ultra-violent, absurdist post-apocalyptic world that’s thrilling to experience.
Marvel fans are also sure to enjoy seeing actor Chris Evans in the lead role of grizzled rebel Curtis, a character worlds away from Captain America.
Netflix description: “A coder at a tech company wins a week-long retreat at the compound of his company’s CEO, where he’s tasked with testing a new artificial intelligence.”
Why you should watch: Smart, sleek, and unsettling, “Ex Machina” uses artificial intelligence to explore how our preexisting ideas about gender and sexuality factor into our understanding of what it means to be human.
There’s also a trio of standout performances from Domhnall Gleeson, Oscar Isaac, and Alicia Vikander. Plus, it has a great Isaac-centric dance sequence.
Netflix description: “In a Los Angeles of the slight future, a lonely writer develops a relationship with ‘Samantha,’ an insightful and sensitive artificial entity.”
Why you should watch: As technology continues to transform our world, movies must grapple with its positive and negative effects in a nuanced way. “Her” manages to do just that, following the budding romance between recently single writer Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) and sentient voice operating system Samantha (Scarlett Johansson).
Through exploring their unconventional relationship, the movie unpacks the extent to which the bonds we form and maintain online compare to in-person connections, an easily compelling topic for contemporary, tech-savvy audiences.
Netflix description: “In this mind-bending sci-fi thriller, a man runs an espionage business built around entering the subconscious of his targets to mold their thoughts.”
Why you should watch: Following up the Oscar-winning superhero drama “The Dark Knight” is no easy task, but director Christopher Nolan certainly rose to the challenge with “Inception.”
Featuring a star-studded cast led by Leonardo DiCaprio, the film is a visually stunning blockbuster with enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end.
Netflix description: “After being bitten by a radioactive spider, Brooklyn teen Miles Morales gets a crash course in web-slinging from his alternate-dimension counterparts.”
Why you should watch: Yes, “Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse” is also a superhero movie, but its vibrantly imaginative exploration of parallel universes is part of what makes it so great.
Remixing the superhero origin story with the introduction of multiple Spider-Men, “Into the Spiderverse’s” message that anyone can be a hero appeals to adults and kids alike.
Netflix description: “As he nears the end of a lonely three-year stint on the moon base Sarang, Sam Bell begins to hear and see strange things.”
Why you should watch: Oscar winner Sam Rockwell gives what is arguably his best performance to date in “Moon,” a one-man space story that will appeal to fans of haunting, retro sci-fi like “Alien” and “2001: A Space Odyssey.”
Netflix description: “A seductive alien prowls the streets in search of prey: unsuspecting men who fall under her spell, only to be consumed by a strange liquid pool.”
Why you should watch: Scarlett Johansson leads “Under the Skin” as an alien femme fatale in this mesmerizing original movie, making it one that fans of the genre shouldn’t miss.
With its intriguing premise and a career-best performance from Johansson, the indie film is as absorbing as it is horrifying.
Netflix description: “A going-away party in Manhattan is interrupted when a mysterious monster of epic proportions launches an attack on New York City.”
Why you should watch: One of the most original science fiction projects of the 2000s, this J.J. Abrams-produced monster movie stands apart by using a first-person, found-footage perspective not commonly seen in the sci-fi genre.
The result is a mashup of “Blair Witch Project” and “Godzilla” that calls to mind 1950s monster movies – in the best way.
Netflix description: “A gentle giant and the girl who raised her are caught in the crossfire between animal activism, corporate greed, and scientific ethics.”
Why you should watch: Before “Parasite,” Bong Joon Ho also wrote and directed “Okja.” Stars like Jake Gyllenhaal and Tilda Swinton round out the genre-defying adventure, in which a young South Korean girl (Ahn Seo-hyun) fights to rescue her beloved, genetically engineered “superpig” from the clutches of an exploitative, multinational conglomerate.
Deftly balancing its satire of corporate evil, coming-of-age narrative, and intercontinental action sequences, “Okja” is an eclectic, engrossing movie experience.
Netflix description: “After the world’s top scientists disappear, orphaned April secretly forges ahead with a family experiment and gets tangled up in a vast conspiracy.”
Why you should watch: “April and the Extraordinary World” follows a girl who lives in an alternate, steampunk version of France and tries to carry on her family’s mission of creating a serum that grants its users immortality.
Animation fans will undoubtedly relish the movie’s blend of whimsical design and steampunk aesthetics, while children are bound to delight in its zanier elements – a talking cat, anyone?
Netflix description: “A young Han Solo tries to settle an old score with the help of his new buddy Chewbacca, a crew of space smugglers, and a cunning old friend.”
Why you should watch: “Solo: A Star Wars Story” is the only “Star Wars” movie that isn’t solely available to stream on Disney Plus, making it a solid pick for Netflix users who want to visit a galaxy far, far away without committing to another streaming service.
It’s also worth watching for Donald Glover’s magnetic performance as a young, enviably fashionable Lando Calrissian.
Netflix description: “In order to keep her job at a biomedical engineering firm that prizes youth, a middle-aged woman must submit to a drastic experimental procedure.”
Why you should watch: Jacqueline Kim stars in this underrated futuristic gem as Gwen, a single mother who agrees to be one of the first test subjects in a procedure that transfers a person’s consciousness into a new body. Having recently been fired in a world where women (particularly older women and women of color) have few opportunities, she goes through with the procedure to ensure that her daughter Jules (Samantha Kim) has a brighter future.
“Advantageous” uses the sci-fi trope of uploading one’s consciousness to grappl ewith the timely issues that give women fewer opportunities to support themselves and has an ending that will stay with you long after the movie finishes.
Netflix description: “Eccentric inventor Doc Brown turns a DeLorean into a time machine that inadvertently sends his young friend, Marty McFly, 30 years into the past.”
Why you should watch it: This sci-fi classic perfectly balances its wacky, lovable characters, madcap time travel adventures, and sweet exploration of growing up and realizing that your parents were once just like you. “Back to the Future” is one of the most enduring ’80s blockbusters, and has a fantastic soundtrack to boot.
Netflix description: “Marty and Doc are at it again in this sequel to the 1985 blockbuster as the time-traveling duo head to 2015 to nip some McFly family woes in the bud.”
Why you should watch it: Although “Back to the Future Part II” never quite holds a candle to its beloved predecessor, it’s well worth watching for its imaginative rendering of the then-future.
Since 2015 is already a year of the past, it’s also particularly fun to note what the movie got right and wrong about life in the 2010s (for better or for worse, we still haven’t quite figured out flying cars yet).

    <h5 class="mb-1">The 17 best sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sometimes you just want to escape your real life and get immersed in the futuristic, mind-bending worlds of science fiction. Luckily, Netflix has you covered.
The streaming site has a strong selection of sci-fi movies to choose from. Standouts include genre classics such as “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” and “The Matrix,” as well as the dimension-hopping superhero film “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse.” There are also numerous science fiction thrillers available to stream, such as “Moon” and “Inception.”
Here are 17 great sci-fi movies you can stream on Netflix right now.
Note: Numerous Netflix titles drop off the service monthly, so the availability of titles below may change.
Insider has many movie and TV show lists to keep you occupied. You can read them all here.
Netflix description: “In a smog-choked dystopian Los Angeles, blade runner Rick Deckard is called out of retirement to snuff a quartet of escaped ‘replicants.'”
Why you should watch: Widely regarded as a sci-fi classic, “Blade Runner: The Final Cut” is equal parts cyberpunk thriller and noir detective story.
Touching on common questions of the genre (such as what it means to be human, and how closely artificial intelligence can copy that humanity), director Ridley Scott’s masterpiece is further enhanced thanks to the final cut’s extra footage not featured in the movie’s theatrical release.
Netflix description: “A computer hacker learns that what most people perceive as reality is actually a simulation created by machines, and joins a rebellion to break free.”
Why you should watch: With its mind-boggling worldbuilding and ambitious, martial arts-inspired action sequences, the Wachowskis’ tech odyssey captivated audiences when it first hit theaters in 1999.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mick Jagger and Bryan Adams are among the dozens of artists participating in an online concert for India that takes place today (May 3), with the aim of helping tackle the unique problems faced by the world’s second-most populous nation during the coronavirus pandemic.
Bollywood filmmakers Karan Johar and Zoya Akhtar organized the event, iForIndia, which uses the tagline "The concert for our times" and will feature a series of four-minute home-recorded performances.
“Two weeks ago, we started work on India’s biggest concert,” the event's organizers noted in a statement. “To entertain people who are locked-down at home. To pay tribute to those who work on the frontlines while we work from home. And to raise funds for those who have no work and no home.” The concert will be streamed via Facebook’s Indian app page starting at 7.30 P.M. Indian Standard Time (10 A.M. ET / 7 A.M. PT). Donations can be made here.
Meanwhile, Jagger and the Rolling Stones are set to stream a series of bonus footage clips taken from live concert films throughout their career. Titled Extra Licks, the series begins at 3 P.M. ET / 12 P.M. PT today (May 3) with 2016's Olé Olé Olé!: A Trip Across Latin America. You can watch a trailer below and see the full stream here.
Sting performed three songs as part of Rolling Stone’s In My Room series, delivering the Police classic “Message in a Bottle” followed by solo tracks “Fragile” and “Englishman in New York.” He commented: “I’m lucky enough to have a recording studio here, where I can work every day. I’m very fortunate; I’m very grateful. I’m also grateful for our healthcare workers, who are doing an extraordinary job, risking their lives everyday on the front line. The best thing that we can do is to help them, and not to get sick, and not to add to their workload, because we are all in this together.”
Sammy Hagar and the Circle’s latest lockdown performance was a cover of AC/DC’s “Whole Lotta Rosie,” while John Fogerty and his children played Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Green River” after the frontman explained the song's roots in a campfire setting. Watch both videos below:
David Byrne announced a new section for his Reasons to be Cheerfulonline magazine, which he originally launched to counter the apparent constant stream of bad news around the world. According to a press release, the section, titled “Now Anything is Possible,” will explore the “the once-in-a-generation potential of the extraordinary changes” presented by the pandemic. “This is a catalyzing moment and many of the changes that have been made or contemplated are going to be permanent – some of those are good, and some deeply questionable,” he said in a statement. “[H]ow can we keep the good stuff? Who is doing it (it’s already happening) and how [are] those ideas and initiatives… working out?”
At time of writing, over 3.51 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed worldwide, with 245,474 deaths and over 1.13 million recoveries. Of the roughly 2.13 million active cases, 98 percent were reported as mild while two percent were said to be serious or critical. In the U.S., the total stood at over 1.16 million total cases with 67,535 deaths and 173,910 recoveries.

    <h5 class="mb-1">An actor, mother, social worker – Nargis Dutt was far more than Mother India</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: Gap-toothed beauty Nargis Dutt, who graced the silver screen from the 1940s to ‘60s, has often been described as a legend. After all, there is a category in the National Film Awards named the ‘Nargis Dutt Award’ in her honour.
The first Indian actress to receive a Padma Shri award, Nargis featured in 51 films including Mother India, Barsaat, Shree 420 and Andaz. And yet her end was a lot more grim than her beginnings.
Nargis died of pancreatic cancer in 1981, just days before the release of Rocky, her son, Sanjay Dutt’s first movie. She was 51 years old and left behind a substantive body of work that proved she could play both a royal persona in an epic like Humayun and a spoiled cosmopolitan girl like in Andaz. But Nargis had range not just on screen, but off it as well.
At the peak of her fame, she gave up acting to raise a family and ended up dedicating her life to the cause of spastic children. Her charitable work earned her a seat in the Rajya Sabha in 1980. The Nargis Dutt Foundation, instituted in her honour, has been working in the field of health, education and women’s empowerment for the past 40 years.
On the star’s 39th death anniversary, ThePrint takes a look at her journey from actor to cultural icon.

Born Fatima Rashid on 1 June 1929, in Allahabad, she was someone in whose home “art was the way of life”. Her mother was a renowned classical singer, Jaddanbai, and her father belonged to an affluent family of Rawalpindi. The family briefly moved to Calcutta before settling down in Bombay. Young Nargis was what people then called a tomboy and loved playing badminton, but perhaps the first sign of her acting chops was in school plays at Queen Mary’s.
Nargis was steered into acting by her mother at a very young age. She made her debut at 4 in a film called Talashe Haq which her mother produced and curated music for. It’s no surprise that Nargis’ brother, Anwar Hussain also took up the craft.
But it was Mehboob Khan’s Mother India (1957) that put her on the map and it was Khan who suggested her stage name. In the film, she played Radha, a poor woman determined to raise her children despite hardships and social exploitation, who ends up killing her son, a bandit and sexual harasser (played by her future husband, Sunil Dutt). It won her a Filmfare Award for Best Actress in 1958 and became the first Indian film to be nominated for the Academy Awards.
Incidentally, it was on the set of this film that Sunil Dutt rescued her from a fire. Her on and off relationship with actor and filmmaker Raj Kapoor was the subject of some talk, and his son, the late Rishi Kapoor, even wrote about it in his memoir, Khullam Khulla.
In an interview with Simi Garewal, Sunil Dutt revealed that Nargis used to call him her “biggest Baby”. She extended the same care to many film crews she would work with. As one crew member recalls in her biographical documentary, Nargis would nag them about eating well and sleeping early.
The two raised three children – Sanjay, who became an actor, Priya, who joined the Congress party and Namrata, who has shied away from the limelight throughout her life. Sanjay, the eldest, was the “most pampered”. However, according to Yaseer Usman’s book Sanjay Dutt: The Crazy Untold Story of Bollywood’s Bad Boy, the middle child, Namrata remembers, “Mom sometimes got angry with Sanjay. She’d spew expletives like suwar, ullu, gadha and even threw a chappal at him.”
According to Priya, Nargis knew about Sanjay’s drug addiction during his youth “but didn’t want to accept it”. Her death left a lasting impact on him considering she passed three days before the launch of his first film, Rocky. At the premier, there was a chair left empty in her honour, recalled Sunil.
Nargis became the first patron of the Spastic Society of India in 1973 and in her biographical documentary, you can see her visit to the first clinic – playfully interacting with children and teaching them one-on-one. According to Mithu Alur, founder of the Spastic Society of India, Nargis told her she “always wanted to be a doctor and do medicine…but didn’t have the opportunity”. After her death, Sunil Dutt funded the Spastic Society. Little is known of what has become of the patronage since his death in 2005.
Priya has carried on the legacy of the Nargis Dutt Foundation, set up by Sunil in 1981, which has successfully set up medical camps across India and mobile clinics in slums. The actor’s battle with cancer also birthed the Nargis Dutt Memorial Cancer Foundation in 1982.
From the long list of honours and establishments set up in her memory, it’s safe to say Nargis has been immortalised. An actor, a mother, a social worker and a woman driven by compassion – the mark she left behind is yet to fade.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sister unveils tragic details about Madhubala's life</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Madhubala, who tragically passed away in 1969 at the age of 36, is still considered one of Bollywood’s earliest and finest beauties.
Her role as Anarkali set her apart from many of her contemporaries, and is still revered, decades after her death. But, Madhubala was not an enigma just because of the roles she played but also because of her tumultuous personal life.
As reported by Bollywood Hungama, one Yaser Khan on Twitter detailed her sister, Madhur Bhushan’s, remarks about her late, great sister. From her career beginnings to falling in multiple loves that were destined for failure and her sickness that ultimately took her life, Madhur, who lovingly referred to Madhubala as Apa, shared an intimate look at her.
“Apa first fell in love with Premnath. The relationship lasted six months. It broke on grounds of religion. He asked her to convert and she refused,” she revealed, adding that “the next relationship was with Dilip Kumar,” – a pairing that was immortalised in 1960’s Mughal-E-Azam. 
Madhur then talked about her long affair with Dilip Kumar, who she referred to as Bhaijan endearingly. “She met Bhaijan (Dilip Kumar) on the sets of Tarana. It was a nine year long affair. They even got engaged. Unki apa aayee thi, chunni lekar (his sister had come with a chunni as is the custom). Bhaijan was also a Pathan,” she said.
Madhur went on to clarify that their father never stopped them from getting married – many news outlets report that Madhubala’s father did not want to lose the financial security by getting her married. “We already had enough money by then and were financially secure,” said Madhur.
Talking endearingly about Dilip, Madhur also shared how he was respectful towards “us children” and addressed them with ‘ap’. The two would often go for a drive or sit in the room and talk.
What happened then to break one of India’s, perhaps, most iconic pairing? “The breakup with Dilip Kumar happened due to the court case during Naya Daur in the mid ’50s,” she said, detailing the issue further.
“The unit was to shoot somewhere in Gwalior. During the shooting of another film at the same location, a mob had attacked the women and even torn their clothes off. My father was wary and just asked that the locale be changed,” she reminisced.
“It’s not that he (their father) didn’t let her go outdoors. Apa had shot in Mahableshwar, Hyderabad and other places before. Bhaijan called my father ‘a dictator’ in court and sided with the Chopras (late BR Chopra was the director). Darare padh gayee, rishtey toot gaye (relationships were broken).”
Madhur also posed a question at the now 91 year-old Dilip Kumar – “We love and respect Bhaijan but I have just one question, ‘Aapki mohabbat yahan thi, aapki chahat yahan thi, phir aapne aisa kyun kiya (why didn’t you side with your love)?’ Bhaijan could’ve simply said let’s change the location. Or remained neutral.”
Madhur remembered how her Apa would cry a lot those days, and talk to Dilip on the phone in an effort to patch things up, and he was steadfast is his request, “Leave your father and I’ll marry you.” And she’d stick to hers, “I’ll marry you but just come home, say sorry and hug him.” It was zid (ego) which destroyed their love.
Their father, according to Madhur, never demanded her to break off her engagement with Dilip or demanded him to apologise.
For the majority of her life, Madhubala for the sole bread-winner for her family – from an age as early as perhaps 7-8 years old. Her father, a hot-headed Pathan could not bear being badly treated and lost a 15-year-old job in seconds, and they all relocated to Mumbai, where she got her first role as a child-actor in Basant. She remained the earning member till the last.
“Being Pathans we were all tall, fair and had long hair. But none of us sisters looked like her. Our mother was short. We had taken after our father. But we weren’t a patch on Apa. She loved wearing plain white sarees. At home she’d wear maxis. She loved mogras in her hair. She was fond of gold and kundan jewellery,” Madhur reminisced.
Madhubala later got married to Kishore Kumar and remained married to him till he death. “On the rebound Apa got involved with Kishore Kumar who was going through a divorce with Ruma Devi Guha Thakurta (actor-singer).”
“Their love affair went on for three years through Chalti Ka Naam Gadi and Half Ticket. They got married in 1960, when she was 27. After marriage, a doctor told her she had only two years. After that Kishore left her at our house saying, ‘I can’t look after her. I’m on outdoors often’,” shared Madhur of her sister’s unfulfilled marriage.
“She wanted to be with him. He’d visit her once in two months though. He never abused her as was reported. He bore her medical expenses. They remained married for nine years.”
Madhur shared how, during her last nine years, she was confined to bed and was reduced to just bones and skin. “She’d keep crying, ‘Mujhe zinda rehna hai, mujhe marna nahin hai, doctor kab ilaaj nikalenge (I want to live, I don’t want to die, wonder when the doctors will find a cure).”
During her last days, Madhur, who was 19 by that time was suffering from chicken pox and couldn’t visit her Apa who passed away on February 23, 1969 at the age of 36. “Though Bhaijan never visited her when she was unwell, he flew down from Madras to pay his last respects at the kabrastan (cemetery). Food was sent from his home to ours for three days (as is the custom).”
In the end, Madhur shared that her sister was heart-broken, although content, when Dilip Kumar married Saira Banu. “She’d say, ‘Unke naseeb mein woh (Saira Banu) thi, main nahin’. But she’d also say, ‘He’s got married to a very pretty girl. She’s so devoted. I’m very happy for him’. But a vacuum remained in her heart.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gigi Hadid’s ex Tyler Cameron ‘excited’ about her pregnancy news</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gigi Hadid’s ex-boyfriend Tyler Cameron has nothing but nice words to say about his former love, admitting he’s ‘excited’ about her pregnancy news.
The Victoria’s Secret model is currently expecting her first child with boyfriend Zayn Malik just a few months after the pair reconciled their on-off five-year relationship. 
During their recent split, Gigi, 25, moved on and dated Bachelorette star Tyler for a short while before reuniting with Zayn. 
Reacting to the model’s baby news, Tyler said on ESPN West Palm on Saturday: ‘If anything, I’m excited for her. I’m happy for her. She’s gonna be an incredible mother.’ 
Over the past week, Tyler’s been subjected to odd rumours that he’s actually the father of Gigi’s unborn child due to their recent relationship. 
But shutting down the speculation, the reality star stated: ‘No, no, but she’s going to be the most incredible mother. She’s a caring sweet person and she’s gonna be amazing.’ 
He had previously responded to fans on social media: ‘Y’all are wrong in the comments. Y’all are terrible,’ when they began commenting that he was the dad. 
Gigi confirmed the joyful news of her pregnancy during an interview with The Tonight Show’s Jimmy Fallon. 
‘Obviously we wish we could have announced it on our own terms but we’re very excited and happy, and grateful for everyone’s well-wishes and support,’ Gigi told the host in their video interview. 
‘It definitely wasn’t bad news and we’re happy now to be excited about it. 
When host Jimmy urged her not to overdo anything, and ‘be present’ for every part of her pregnancy, she insisted: ‘I’m trying. Especially during this time, it’s a nice silver lining to be able to be home and together and really experience it, day by day.’ 
It comes after TMZ reported Gigi was around 20 weeks pregnant and had told her family that she and Zayn were expecting a little one. 
Eagle-eyed fans then noticed that Gigi’s recent 25th birthday celebrations may have also doubled up as a baby shower, with ‘it’s a girl’ decorations spotted in her Instagram stories.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gigi Hadid's ex-boyfriend, Tyler Cameron, predicts she will be an 'incredible' mother</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gigi Hadid’s former lover Tyler Cameron has praised the model and predicts she will be an “incredible” mother as he gushed about the Real Housewives of Beverley Hills star.
Gigi and her boyfriend Zayn Malik, 27, delighted fans last month when they revealed they were expecting their first child together following five years of on-and-off dating.
Bachelorette hunk Tyler, 27, enjoyed a whirlwind romance with 25-year-old Gigi between August and October last year while she was on a relationship hiatus from One Direction star Zayn.
And while the romance may have been brief, Tyler says he has enough insight on Gigi’s personality to give a glowing opinion of how she will be as a mother.
Speaking to ESPN West Palm, Tyler gushed: “If anything, I'm excited for her. I'm happy for her. She's gonna be an incredible mother.”
The reality star also laughed off the suggestion that the baby could be his.
Asked about being the father, he replied: “No, no, but she's going to be the most incredible mother. She's a caring sweet person and she's gonna be amazing.”
Tyler’s nervous rejection of the suggestion he could be the father of Gigi’s child followed a similar line of questioning from fans during an Instagram Live chat Tyler held last week.
In the comments section of the chat, one cheeky follower wrote: “Congrats on becoming the father. Gigi is preg.”
But Tyler was quick to knock down the joke, replying: “Y’all are wrong in the comments. Y'all are terrible.”
Last week Gigi beamed about becoming a first time mother during an appearance on Jimmy Fallon’s late night talk show.
"We're very excited and happy and grateful for everyone's well wishes and support," Gigi gushed
And while Zayn himself is yet to publicly comment on becoming a father, Gigi added: "It's a nice silver lining to be able to be home and be together and really experience it day by day."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tyler Cameron Gushes Ex Gigi Will Be An ‘Incredible Mother’ After She Confirms Pregnancy With Zayn</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">How kind! Tyler Cameron, 27, said the most precious things about his former fling Gigi Hadid, 25, after word broke that she’s expecting her first child with boyfriend Zayn Malik, 27. He did this during an interview with Josh Cohen and the Home Team on ESPN West Palm earlier this week where the former Bachelor star thinks she’s going to do A-OK if not better in the world of motherhood. “If anything, I am excited for her, I am happy for her,” he gushed while adding, “She is going to be an incredible mother.” Aww! Tyler also denied the rumor that he is the father of the supermodel’s child during the chat. “No, no, but she is going to be the most incredible mother. She’s a caring, sweet person and she’s going to be amazing.”
This isn’t the first time that Tyler has shut down any speculation that he’s the baby daddy. He did an Instagram Live with his fans on Wednesday, April 29, where one of them dropped the allegation. “Congrats on becoming the father. Gigi is preg,” they wrote. He appeared to respond to their words by simply saying, “Y’all are wrong in the comments. Y’all are terrible.” The studly reality star has had his fair share of women he’s been linked to outside of Gigi over the past year that also include Kylie Jenner‘s BFF Stassie Karanikolaou, 22, and, of course, Hannah Brown, 25.
Gigi finally confirmed the news that she’s pregnant and that Zayn is indeed the dad during a pre-taped appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday, April 30. “Obviously, we wished we could have announced it on our own terms, but we’re very excited and happy and grateful for everyone’s well wishes and support,” she revealed.
So many celebs have been announcing their joyous baby news lately! Other A-list stars that are currently expecting include Lea Michele and Zandy Reich, Chris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenengger and Ashlee Simpson and Evan Ross. The former Glee star shared her first baby bump photo on Saturday, May 2.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dua Lipa Raves About Gigi Hadid And Zayn Malik’s Baby News: Her Boyfriend Anwar And She Are ‘Very, Very Excited’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gigi Hadid And Zayn Malik are expecting a baby together and the whole world is excited, including, or rather, especially, family members and others close to them! That being said, singer Dua Lipa, who is dating Gigi’s brother Anwar, opened up about the great news.
After calling in to The Edge NZ, the star admitted that ‘Yeah! It’s very exciting news.’
Dua and Anwar have been in isolation together so she was definitely amongst the first few people who found out about the pregnancy, right?
Maybe not because she was asked about it and she claimed that she learned about it ‘a little bit’ but not ‘too long‘ before the happy news became public knowledge.
The hosts made sure to congratulate her for pretty much becoming an ‘auntie!’
This comes after Gigi confirmed she is indeed pregnant following days of rumors.
During a chat with Jimmy Fallon, she dished that ‘Obviously, we wished we could’ve announced it on our terms, but we are very excited, happy and grateful for everybody’s well wishes and support.’
And that was not all as the supermodel also made sure to mention that Zayn Malik was the baby daddy since there were speculations floating around that it was, in fact, Tyler Cameron!
Gigi has been spending her quarantine with her loved ones on their farm in Pennsylvania and it sounds like she doesn’t mind being stuck at home because of that.
After all, she explained that there was a true ‘silver lining‘ and that is being ‘able to be home, be together and truly experience it day by day.’
The mom to be also revealed her biggest pregnancy cravings, saying that it’s ‘everything bagel’ and that she eats it every day!
That being said, she mentioned how happy she was that her birthday cake was a huge everything bagel.
‘Then I found out that Buddy [Valastro], the ‘Cake Boss,’ made my cake … I do not know if it was my hormones or just, like, quarantine emotionalness, but I cried every 5 minutes for an hour every time I thought about Buddy made my cake,’ she told the host.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Star filmmakers draw inspiration from Russia lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic might have brought the film industry to a halt but Andrei Konchalovsky, one of Russia's most renowned film and theatre directors, is as busy as ever.
He wants to make a documentary about daily life under quarantine, exploring the poetic side of the mundane, and he has invited ordinary Russians to work with him on the project.
"All of us have ended up on a desert island and that's the most interesting thing," the 82-year-old told AFP in a video interview.
In late March, Konchalovsky issued a call on social media to his fans to make short videos for a project he has called "Quarantine Russian Style".
"Take your smartphones, film your new routines, your favourite spot at home, or even your work web conference. And we'll make movies!" he said.
Every week the celebrated filmmaker, who is followed by more than 400,000 people on Facebook, asks his co-creators a number of questions.
He wants them to speak about their fears or new rituals or even tell him about the "craziest" thing they have purchased during the lockdown.
Konchalovsky, who has earned multiple international awards and worked with renowned filmmaker Andrey Tarkovsky, has already received thousands of video clips and photos to choose from.
"They shoot them from their room, a decrepit window sill or a favourite old sofa," he said.
Sometimes contributors read out a text or wax philosophical about Russians' coping mechanisms.
Scenes have included Russians sharing a vodka bottle at a makeshift table connecting two nearby balconies or riding a bike to a neighbour's door.
Konchalovsky, who lived in the United States for many years and whose Hollywood movies include "Tango and Cash", also asked aspiring filmmakers to reflect on the nature of the quarantine in Russia and how it may be different from lockdowns in China or Europe.
The film director said his countrymen might adapt better to crises than people in the West.
"Specifics of life in Russia have fostered in man an enormous ability to resist sanctions,"  he said. 
"That is why we will be able to tough it out."
'Tales from Quarantine'
Konchalovsky is not the only filmmaker to have found new inspiration during the lockdown.
Director and producer Timur Bekmambetov, who is regarded as one of the inventors of the "Screenlife" format, in which movies take place entirely on computer screens, wants to produce a film about the lockdown in the new genre.
Like Konchalovsky, he has invited Russians to contribute short videos and script pitches for a project he has called "Tales From The Quarantine". 
The crowd-sourced stories could be real or fictional.
"Today we live more and more on our screens rather than in real life: it's where we fall in love, get angry, where we find and lose work and understand who we are," Bekmambetov told AFP in a video interview from the city of Kazan more than 800 kilometres (500 miles) east of Moscow.
The first episode is called "Telecommuting" and features professional actors in a web conference.
"Confinement speeds up usage of a new audiovisual language," said Bekmambetov, 58, who shot to fame in the 2000s when he directed Russian fantasy thrillers "Day Watch" and "Night Watch".
"Traditional cinema, which has come to a standstill during the crisis, is outdated," he said.
"We no longer want movies about bank heists in the era of electronic payments or balcony serenades in time of social networks."
'We must survive'
Due to the epidemic, the Russian film industry is likely to lose around 60 percent of revenue this year, according to preliminary estimates from the culture ministry.
But online platforms still offer an opportunity to earn an income. This is what Galiya Fatkhutdinova, who makes short films, hopes to do.
The 35-year-old was giving acting classes in China when the coronavirus epidemic struck. 
Stuck in quarantine, she decided to launch a series of short films to document the experience upon her return to Russia. 
She invited dozens of her actor friends -- who had all lost their jobs due to the contagion -- to participate in a project dubbed "The Isolated".
"'The Isolated' talks about everything that goes on in isolation: love, betrayal, politics," Fatkhutdinova told AFP.
She is now looking to sell her film to an online platform -- one of the few distribution possibilities left during the lockdown -- to be able to pay her actors.
"We must survive these strange times," she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">YouTube terminates David Icke’s account</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTube have deleted conspiracy theorist David Icke’s account.
The video-sharing site said the 68-year-old violated its policies on sharing information about coronavirus.
The former footballer has made controversial unproven claims about the virus on several internet platforms, including a discredited theory that it is linked to the 5G mobile network.
The video service, owned by Google, told the BBC: “YouTube has clear policies prohibiting any content that disputes the existence and transmission of Covid-19 as described by the WHO and the NHS.
“Due to continued violation of these policies we have terminated David Icke’s YouTube channel.”
The ban follows a similar move by Facebook, who removed Icke’s page from their site on Friday.
Famous medics including Dr Christian Jessen and former junior doctor Adam Kay have called on social networks to remove Icke from their platforms.
They are backed by the Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), who claim Icke’s conspiracies over Covid-19 have been viewed more than 30 million times.
“We commend YouTube on bowing to pressure and taking action on David Icke’s channel,” said CCDH’s chief executive Imran Ahmed.
“However, there remains a network of channels and shadowy amplifiers, who promote Mr Icke’s content (and) need to be removed.”
They asked for other networks to follow the lead, and added: “It is time for Instagram and Twitter to follow Facebook and YouTube by acting to remove Icke and his content from their platforms.
“Lies cost lives in a global pandemic, and their failure to act promptly puts us all at risk.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Shawn Mendes & Camila Cabello Joke About Making ‘Organic Slime’ After Winning Kids’ Choice Award</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Shawn Mendes, 21, and Camila Cabello, 23, just won big at the Kids’ Choice Awards! The couple and “Senorita” collaborators nabbed Favorite Music Collaboration blimp on the broadcast for the song, and thanked their fans with a sweet message. “What’s up guys! Thank you so much for the Kids’ Choice Award, we love you so much,” Shawn began in the selfie-filmed video from their home in Miami, Florida. “This is so cool. I literally watched the Kids’ Choice Awards for forever and we wish we were there to get slimed,” Camila added.
“We wish that we could be there with you, but we hope that everybody is staying safe,” Shawn added, as Camila couldn’t resist bringing up the one thing the KCAs are known for: slime! “We love you, thank you so much for voting. We’re going to make organic slime and slime ourselves,” she joked! We’ll be keeping an eye on their social accounts if that indeed does happen. The couple looked cozy and casual at home, as Camila rocked a white, blue, and red t-shirt along with a ’90s-inspired pair of black overalls! For his part, Shawn rocked an open olive-green button down shirt and black t-shirt. The pair rocked the same outfits in their videos a day earlier promoting the All-In challenge.
“Congrats, you two are the cutest!” host Victoria Justice gushed, as she revealed Shawn had earned a second award for Favorite Male Artist! “Thank you so much for choosing me, your Favorite Male Artist everybody. I just want to say I love you guys and I miss you so much,” Shawn said in a second video, filmed outdoors. “Not a day goes by where I don’t think of you guys, and remember how incredible my fans are. I can’t wait to perform with all of you and sing with you again,” the Canadian singer added.
The couple joined the broadcast, which was hosted by Victorious star Victoria Justice, from Camila’s parents home in Miami, Florida where they have been in quarantine since March. Shawn and Camila are seen going for casual walks almost daily in the area, with Shawn hilariously enjoying his coffee in a ceramic mug (we’re guessing he can’t get his Canadian fave Tim Horton’s down in Florida!).
Shawn and Camila have been slaying it with their virtual performances all month long, and delivered an incredible cover of Louis Armstrong’s “It’s A Wonderful World” on the One World: Together At Home special on April 18. The song was the perfect choice to show support to the hardworking healthcare workers and those working on the frontlines during the pandemic. Shawn accompanied his leading lady on piano as they sung together, showing off their incredible vocals.
The Kids Choice Awards was originally scheduled to air on Mar. 22, however, was postponed amidst the Coronavirus pandemic. Nickelodeon announced the virtual version, Nickelodeon’s Kids’ Choice Awards 2020: Celebrate Together, which also served to donate an incredible $1 million donation to No Kid Hungry.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Singer Camila Cabello is giving one lucky fan the opportunity to make an appearance in her next music video as part of the All-In Challenge.
The Havana hitmaker is the latest Hollywood personality to join the charity initiative, which aims to benefit organisations helping to feed people amid the coronaviruspandemic.
Cabello, 23, made the announcement in a video she shared on Twitter on Saturday.
“I’m offering a day on set of my next music video when social distancing is over. You will make a cameo in the music video, you will learn choreography with me, I’ll teach you all the moves — well, my choreographer will teach us the moves,” she said.
The winner with most donations will get a round-trip domestic flight, a one-night hotel stay and the on-set experience with the Grammy-nominated singer.
All the funds raised will go to Feeding America, Meals on Wheels, World Central Kitchen and No Kid Hungry.
Other Hollywood names participating in the cause include Leonardo DiCaprio, Robert De Niro, Madonna, Russell Wilson and Ciara, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, and Justin Bieber.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Legal drama 'All Rise' adapts to pandemic for season finale</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES - The legal drama “All Rise” has become the first U.S. scripted television series to adapt the the pandemic by producing an episode remotely, enlisting its stars to work from home on their own makeup, set design and lighting.
The season finale, airing Monday night on CBS, finds Simone Missick’s Judge Lola Carmichael presiding over a Los Angeles Superior Court bench trial via video conference.
Missick said she was exhausted at the end of each shooting day after making her own adjustments to costume and sound, converting her living room into an office and her dining room into a court room.
“I did pick up new skills. I think that I could be a location scout-slash-set design co-ordinator. I don’t need to lead the department, but I could be in the background,” Missick laughed in a Zoom interview. “So if this acting stuff doesn’t work out, I could maybe pick up a career doing it virtually because that was the fun part.”
While most full-season shows cut production short due to stay-home orders, “All Rise” creator Greg Spottiswood said he realized that the dialogue-heavy nature of his show allowed for remote production. A key challenge — predicting how the legal world would adjust to the novel coronavirus, with prisons becoming outbreak hotspots and video chats replacing in-court hearings.
“The justice system needs to find a way to respond to this moment. Technology is one of the ways that they’re responding to it,” he said.
Spottiswood said producers paid the full crew, even those that weren’t able to work, for the episode. While the show could produce more episodes remotely in a second season if necessary, he’s anxious to get back to sets and real-world locations.
Missick said her mother-in-law in Atlanta had been hospitalized with COVID-19 for eight days, with symptoms serious enough to require a ventilator. She had fully recovered by the time Missick began shooting, but it brought the coronavirus crisis close to home for the 38-year-old actress.
In her downtime after production, Missick has enjoyed Hulu’s “Little Fires Everywhere” and the Netflix series “Unorthodox.” But she’s been struck by how far away from today’s reality the action on the screen can feel.
“Everything is BC. It’s ‘before coronavirus.’ You’re watching people — they’re in restaurants, they’re hugging each other. You’re like, ‘God, I remember what that was like.’ Now, I think every show that comes after is going to have to deal with what this pandemic is.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Curtis Pritchard gets butt naked to celebrate national gardening day</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Love Island star Curtis Pritchard apparently has a lot of love for gardening after posing butt naked to celebrate the national appreciation day. 
The 24-year-old was in a cheeky mood on Saturday (2 May) and shared a photo of himself standing completely naked with his back towards the camera, wearing only a pair of gloves and boots. 
‘HAPPY INTERNATIONAL NAKED GARDENING DAY !’ he simply captioned the image, and it was enough to have his followers lusting and thirsty. 
His The Greatest Dancer co-star Todrick Hall didn’t hold back his admiration and commented: ‘Hallelujah! Praise god for the screenshot I just took! My new background on my phone!’ 
Clearly one picture wasn’t enough for another of Curtis’ followers, who demanded: ‘Curtis Prichard we need a callander from you [sic].’ 
Posing a very valid question, an inquisitive fan wondered: ‘Who was the lucky camera man.’ 
‘Saturday night just got a whole lot better,’ one admirer admitted, while others pleaded for Curtis to ‘turn around’. 
Let’s keep it PG, folks. 
It’s likely the cameraman was Curtis’ older brother AJ Pritchard as the dancers are in quarantine together at their family home alongside their parents. 
No doubt Curtis appreciated the compliments from his admirers after finding himself single again following his split from girlfriend Maura Higgins. 
The pair found love on last summer’s series of Love Island but split in March after struggling to find time to spend together.
Curtis recently addressed the scrutiny surrounding Maura’s friendship with her Dancing On Ice co-star Alex Demetriou. 
He previously told The Sun: ‘It’s not nice to read about. 
‘I have no proof that ­anything more has ­happened between them. I don’t like to think about it. I don’t want to look back over the past few months for warning signs. But it’s not nice to read about her relationship with Alex and to see pictures of them together.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love Island's Curtis Pritchard poses completely naked as he does gardening in the buff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Curtis Pritchard has been showing a very different side to himself during lockdown.
The former Love Island star, 24, took to Instagram to post a picture of himself completely naked on Saturday.
He decided to strip off to honour Naked Gardening Day 2020 and could be seen wearing a pair of gloves and holding a gardening fork.
In the saucy snap he had his back to the camera and flashed his bare bum as he held up the fork in the air.
He was wearing nothing but a pair of black boots and socks as he posed in his driveway.
"HAPPY INTERNATIONAL NAKED GARDENING DAY!" Curtis captioned the post.
His 1.5million Instagram followers were left in stitches by the cheeky snap.
One commented: "You're welcome to come and do my garden any time."
"Only you Curtis!!!! Love it x," another posted.
A third wrote: "I'm in urgent need of a gardener."
"You can be my gardener any day," a fourth said.
Another posted: "Well that's cheered my Saturday up no end!"
It comes after reports that Curtis' TV show The Greatest Dancer has been axed.
The decision comes comes after producers pulled out all the stops with an all star cast for the 2020 series and big name performers that sadly failed to pull in viewers.
A source told The Sun: "Now the BBC and everyone involved has decided enough is enough and they've binned it.
"Critics liked it and it pulled in a younger audience. But the cost of the big production for the ratings the show delivered was too much."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amid the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, pop star Selena Gomez has set up a small studio at her home, and is working on new music.
The singer took to Instagram to share a picture of her home recording studio.
In the picture, the 27-year-old is seen sitting on the floor next to her furry slippers in front of a studio, with a professional microphone, mic stand, and insulated walls. She is wearing a grey tee with a pair of dark blue pants, she also has a book with a sketch on one side and another book with notes kept in front of her.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Selena Gomez Stuns In Makeup-Free Selfie And Shares Inspiring Message About Mental Health</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Selena Gomez took to her Instagram account to show off her natural beauty as well as inspire people to love themselves more and remain positive, especially amid this quarantine! The star posted a pic in which she was not wearing any makeup and the message that was also featured in the image was her way of spreading positivity just as Mental Health Awareness Month begins.
It appears that Selena is ‘choosing happiness’ even in this scary time and is reminding herself to do that with post-its!
That’s right! Selena had the message ‘I am in charge of how I feel today. I am choosing happiness’ posted on her mirror so she can see it every day and she thought it would be a great idea to share that same sentiment with her fans as well.
That being said, she posed for a mirror selfie in which she looked stunning and fresh-faced and the message can also be seen, front and center!
Hair pulled back and wearing a casual black sweater, Selena is looking down at her phone screen while smiling for the pic.
The image is meant to suggest that her content expression is a result of having read that message on her mirror.
The post-it also features her cosmetics brand’s name, Rare Beauty, at the top since a longer but similar quote was first shared by the brand, to mark Mental Health Awareness Month.
It reads: ‘Choose happiness. Every month is Mental Health Awareness Month – we’ll be sharing more resources, community stories and ways we stay positive all month long. Enjoy your weekend, log off and do something that makes you feel good. #mentalhealthawarenessmonth #rarereminder.’
It’s no secret that Selena is a huge advocate for a greater focus on one’s mental health and also ending all stigma around it so marking the month dedicated to it is no surprise!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Demi Lovato Stuns In A Wine Swimsuit As She Soaks In A Hot Tub</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
Demi revealed that she just learned how to use her self-timer.
Demi Lovato upped her selfie game by learning to use the self-timer feature on her phone, and her fans were the beneficiaries of her newfound knowledge when she snapped a steamy swimsuit snapshot.
On Saturday, Demi took to Instagram to share a set of two photos with her 80.9 million followers. For her intimate solo photo shoot, the 27-year-old singer rocked a strapless bathing suit that was a rich wine color. The garment featured all-over ruching, a design element that elevated its appearance by giving it texture and depth. The folds of gathered fabric also added a touch of elegance to Demi’s figure-flattering swimwear, while a sweetheart neckline gave it a romantic feel.
In Demi’s first photo, all of her bathing suit was submerged in the crystal-clear water of a a hot tub. However, the “Sorry Not Sorry” singer was providing a close look at the tantalizing amount of cleavage that the garment’s low neckline was leaving exposed. In this picture, Demi was reaching out to take the selfie by holding the camera away from her.
Her pale freckled skin looked radiant. Her cheeks were slightly flushed, and her lips were a natural shade of pink. If Demi was wearing any eye makeup at all, it was subtle. However, her dark eyelashes did appear to be curled.
Demi’s second photo was taken from a distance. She was standing up so that the bubbling water in the stone hot tub came up to her hips, which provided a peek at the top of her curvy derriere. She had her back arched, and she was reaching up with both hands to grasp her long, dark hair. The musician had her lips slightly parted, and she was gazing at the camera with a dreamy look on her face.
In the caption of her post, Demi seemingly suggested that she won’t need the help of celebrity photographer Angelo Kritikos as much now that she’s mastered the art of taking timed photos.
It took just one hour for Demi’s demonstration of her photography skills to earn her over 1.1 million likes. Her natural beauty look proved to be a big hit with her followers.
“You look so amazing without your makeup Demi,” read one response to her photos.
“You are so naturally beautiful!” another admirer remarked.
However, one fan was impressed with an area of Demi’s body other than her flawless face.
“How do you get your armpits to look so good?” the commenter asked.
Earlier this year, Demi shared another gorgeous selfie that received rave reviews from her fans. She was completely barefaced, and she let her Instagram followers know that she was “proud” of her freckles and her “booty chin.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to her latest activities, the sister of Cardi B, Hennessy Carolina, has found a way to keep her fans entertained during the ongoing period of social distancing, and she did so with a stunning session of twerking on Instagram.
The 24-year-old younger sister of the “Bodak Yellow” lyricist proved she is definitely not afraid of dancing by herself, as she faced the camera in a skimpy cream top that accentuated her toned stomach and a pair of jeans.
Hennessy chose “Shake the Room” by Pop Smoke and her brother-in-law, Quavo, and she appeared to be enjoying the music.
Besides, Carolina combined her provocative outfit with a belt by Dior and let her hair down for the occasion.
Captioned with “Shaking the room in my @fashionnova jeans,” the footage was quickly liked by over half a million people, and many took to the comment section to express their appreciation of Cardi B’s little sister.
One fan stated that Carolina looked finer and finer every time, while another commenter was more impressed by her assets: “Look at you with ya fine a$s.”
One fan had this to say: “Can I be in your life that omg😍❤️🎯😋🔥Now you know God damn well excuse me, God, I’m sry, but she knows what she is doing wit dat outfit you Blessed her wit dat 🍑 got an MF ready to 👊🏾 💪🏾 👀 LOL.”
Another backer shared; “Damn. I have to pick my jaw up.😶We love your style, Henney.❤️❤️❤️What size are u, sis? I always fill my cart then empty it cause Idk what size is right welp. @hennessycarolina”
This supporter stated: “Wait, did I miss something. What happened to “little booties matter. But damn 😍..”
In another picture, Carolina flaunted her fantastic figure in a pair of white jeans that fitted her unbelievably well and colorful shirt.
In the photo, the model is looking over her shoulder, the bombshell appeared to celebrate the Easter holidays with style, and again her post gathered thousands of likes.
It seems that the picture got the attention of some fellow celebrities as well, as rapper Tory Lanez commented with, “I just wanna bite it,” and concluded with a laughing emoji and “*quarantine radio voice.”
Cardi B’s sister is a brand of her own now.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Christina Milian Sizzles In A Pink Savage X Fenty Bralette</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1, 2020
Ava Bennet
Actress and pop star Christina Milian tantalized her 6.2 million Instagram followers with her latest post, in which she showcased her curvaceous physique in a bold pink ensemble from Savage x Fenty. Christina is one of the ambassadors for the brand, as her caption indicated, and she showcased one of the looks in her latest double update.
Christina appeared to be whipping something up in the kitchen, and had a cutting board with some diced onions and tomatoes in front of her. Her clean and modern kitchen was visible behind her, with gray subway tiles, white countertops and black cabinets along the bottom. Christina’s ensemble was a burst of color in her otherwise neutral space.
She rocked a bright pink bralette top with a subtle pattern on it. The top dipped low in the front, revealing a tantalizing amount of cleavage, and had thin straps that stretched over her shoulder. Two delicate buttons went down the middle of the bralette, right below her cleavage, and the vibrant hue looked stunning against her skin. She also drew more attention to her cleavage with her choice of accessories, as she layered several gold necklaces, including one that dipped between her breasts.
She paired the bralette with matching leggings that had a thick waistband with the brand name written on it. Most of Christina’s lower body was obscured by the countertop, but fans could see a hint of the colorful bottoms.
Her long curly locks hung down in a loose, casual style, and she seemed absolutely radiant in the shot. She had a soft pink gloss on her lips, and minimal eye makeup.
In the second snap from her update, Christina moved away from the counter a bit to show off more of the ensemble. The bottoms seemed cozy, but still had a figure-hugging fit that showcased her curvaceous physique.
Her followers absolutely loved the update, and the post racked up over 197,400 likes within just five hours. It also received 1,524 comments from her fans.
“Omg you are an absolute timeless stunner,” one fan said, followed by a heart eyes emoji.
“You’re glowing,” another follower commented.
“What a beauty,” one follower added.
“You have the cutest smile,” another said.
Christina has been keeping her followers updated during quarantine by sharing plenty of sizzling posts, including many showing off her various outfits. Two days ago, as The Inquisitr reported, she posted a triple Instagram update in which she rocked a corset vest and skinny jeans covered in a unique splatter pattern. The sizzling look was from the online retailer Fashion Nova, and Christina took three smoking-hot shots in her backyard.

Global fashion icon, businesswoman, singer and celebrity, Rihanna caused a stir on Instagram when she launched her new lingerie line with a raunchy photoshoot.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Selena Gomez Stuns In Makeup-Free Pic & Shows Off At-Home Recording Studio In Quarantine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Selena Gomez, 27, is still making music! The pop star shared a gorgeous make-up free photo to her Instagram on Saturday, May 2 as she appeared to be preparing to record a song. “Makeshift studio so I can work from home,” she captioned the post for her 175 million followers, adding headphone, music sheet and microphone emojis. Selena’s complexion absolutely glowed in the photo, which showed her sitting on the ground and looking back at the camera with her right hand resting on her chin. She kept her dark hair loose and down for the at-home recording session, kicking off her fur slippers to go barefoot.
We were loving Selena’s cozy quarantine style as she opted for a gray knit sweater and a casual black sweatpants. She looked relaxed and ready-to-go with her sticker-covered notebook on the ground to the left, and various recording equipment — including a music stand and a mic — surrounded by temporary gray studio walls. The Texas native recently dished about building the at-home studio space, and it looks like it came along swimmingly! “Currently, I’m actually building this little studio situation. I’m doing it with people that have been in my house,” she revealed to Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in an interview released on April 27. “I’m creating a little station where I’m going to be able to FaceTime with my engineer and some of my producer friends, and we’re going to try and make some music. I haven’t started that process, but that’s what we’re doing right now. I was going to FaceTime some of my writing friends, and just see what we’re all feeling during this time,” she said.
The Wizards of Waverly Place alum also opened up about how she’s been spending her time in quarantine. “I do find that routine and structure helps…I’ll go into a little bit of like two days watching a lot of stuff, and then I’ll realize I definitely need to like do something,” she said on the interview, conducted over FaceTime. “I do a lot of walks. I do weights inside of the house. I embarrassingly watch the YouTube videos where I’m trying to do what the woman is telling me to do, but she looks so glamorous doing it,” she added.
Despite being at-home, Selena has plenty on-the-go with the upcoming launch of her highly anticipated makeup line Rare Beauty! “Being rare is about being comfortable in yourself,” Selena narrates in a trailer promoting the line, which drops in “summer 2020” at Sephora according to the website. “I want us all to stop comparing ourselves to each other and embracing our uniqueness. You aren’t defined by a photo, a like or a comment,” she also shares in the uplifting video.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pandemic-era celebrities struggle to strike appropriate tone</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK — As the coronavirus pandemic has forced populations worldwide indoors, many celebrities have harnessed their star power to try and raise spirits online, dubbing the illness a great unifier.
But expressions of solidarity have rung hollow for some social media users fatigued by content that's perhaps well-intentioned but backdropped by hot tubs, crackling fireplaces, or backyard pools.
The most recent eye rolls came after the announcement that some 200 celebrities and politicians -- including billionaire Oprah, superstar actress Julia Roberts and former U.S. President George W Bush -- would participate in a 24-hour long "Call to Unite" livestream event over the weekend to encourage donating to COVID-19 relief efforts.
"If only they knew ppl with money," tweeted journalist Astead Herndon of the announcement.
And yet, we watch: more than 270 million people worldwide tuned in to a recent star-studded marathon special intended to celebrate essential workers that featured headliners the Rolling Stones and Taylor Swift performing from their homes.
Even for those loving to hate, the streamed sing-alongs and Instagram live soliloquies keep the internet rapt, perhaps temporarily alleviating the boredom of life indoors.
Whether messages of the rich and famous fascinate or leave a bad taste, that attention remains "says more about our culture than these actual celebrities," according to professor Cheryl Thompson of Toronto's Ryerson University.
"We might not want to admit it to ourselves," Thompson told AFP, but "we look to them, in some ways, to be our gauge for what we should think and feel."
The scholar of creative industries pointed to Tom Hanks' announcement in mid-March that he had contracted coronavirus, saying that news convinced many people the infection was serious.
Indeed, Jenna Anderson said the realities of the coronavirus first hit her once Hanks -- whom she called a "national-treasure type" -- went public with his illness.
The 30-year-old previously living in Australia, where Hanks quarantined, is now isolating with her family in Houston.
But Anderson said while some content has been useful -- stars' descriptions of symptoms, for example -- "most of what sticks in my mind are negative experiences where celebrities do seem a bit out of touch."
The internet slammed talkshow personality Ellen DeGeneres when she joked self-quarantine in her glassy California mansion was like "being in jail."
Arnold Schwarzenegger criticized spring-breakers from his jacuzzi, cigar in hand, while a coterie of stars led by Gal Gadot became a laughingstock after dropping an awkward cover of John Lennon's "Imagine," including Zoe Kravitz perched by her fireplace while others appeared to be meandering across their estates.
Many stars "seem to really try to keep in the forefront of people's minds in a way that seems unnecessary to me, based on what I assume about how much money they have and how successful they are," Anderson said.
Still, Thompson said "we've always had this sense that celebrities come and take us away from the hard times."
During World War II, for example, the U.S. government called Hollywood stars to visit troops or promote war bond sales.
Many celebrities today have deployed their wealth, including entertainment mogul Rihanna's donation of medical equipment to New York state and $5 million to several relief organizations, or Beyonce's $6 million donation to nonprofits.
Country icon Dolly Parton meanwhile is financing Vanderbilt University research efforts for a vaccine.
Beyond the cash, entertainment can soothe -- and Thompson predicted the trauma of the current moment could fuel more intriguing art in years to come.
"The struggle has always brought with it amazing creative outputs," she said.
Until then there is plenty of celebrity content relying less on platitudes, and more on entertaining the masses by leaning into the absurd.
Britney Spears has been offering eyebrow-raising comic relief including an abrupt tale of the time she "burned down her gym" -- no one was harmed -- while "Mad Men" star January Jones has taken on the role of quarantine eccentric, offering a recipe for a "human stew" detox bath.
And "Jurassic Park" actor Sam Neill has been posting playful albeit slightly unhinged videos -- including a bit where he voices a garden gnome who schools listeners on self-isolation.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lea Michele has confirmed, with a new Instagram post, that she is pregnant. The former Glee star made the announcement in the form of a photo of her wearing a blue floral maternity dress. The caption below the image of her cradling her stomach says, "So grateful."
Michele, who married businessman Zandy Reich in March 2019, is now expecting her first child. Rumors about her pregnancy were already circulating last Monday, when a source for Peoplereported that the couple was expecting. Neither People nor Michele have confirmed her due date.
"They've always wanted to be parents," the People source said.
Michele and Reich started dating in July 2017, and got engaged in April of 2018. They were married in Northern California, with more than 200 guests in attendance. Michele's Glee co-stars Darren Criss and Becca Tobin were there, as well as her Scream Queens co-star Emma Roberts.
"We are so excited to be married and grateful to be surrounded by our friends and family," the couple shared with People at the time. "And most of all, we’re so happy to spend the rest of our lives together."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3 (UPI) -- Glee and Scream Queens alum Lea Michele confirmed reports of her pregnancy by posting a photo of her baby bump on Instagram this weekend.
"So grateful," the 33-year-old actress captioned the outdoor portrait of her smiling with her eyes closed and cradling her baby bump.
The image has gotten nearly 1.6 million "likes" since it was posted on Saturday.
Several media outlets reported she was expecting her first child last week, but this is the first time she has publicly addressed the news.
She married Zandy Reich in March 2019.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jessica Simpson Shows Off Her Toned Arms As She Poses In A Pool With Baby Birdie Mae</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020

The mom of three is all smiles as she gets some pool time with her toddler.
Jessica Simpson showed off her buff arms as she played in the pool with her baby, Birdie Mae Johnson, over the weekend.
In a new photo posted to her Instagram page, the 39-year-old singer and fashion designer is all smiles while cradling her 1-year-old daughter in the shallow end of the pool as she celebrates a free Saturday at home with her family.
The Open Book author has her hair pulled back into a ponytail as she wears a halter-style swimsuit and sunglasses in the black-and-white pic shared with her 5.3 million Instagram fans. Jessica’s toned arms, most likely the result of her workouts with her post-pregnancy trainer, Harley Pasternak, are in full view as she holds on to baby Birdie in the water.
While she’s obviously thrilled to have some mommy-daughter time, in the caption to the post, Jessica revealed the real reason for her happy face. The busy mom of three noted that she feels like a kid in school again with the weekend off. Like many other parents all across the country, Jessica and her husband Eric Johnson have been in homeschool mode with her older children, Maxwell Drew, 8, and Ace Knute, 6, due to the coronavirus pandemic. It’s no wonder the splash in the pool with her baby feels like a much-needed day off.
In comments to the post, fans and famous friends commiserated with Jessica regarding the school situation.
“Right!! I live for the weekends more than ever right now!” one fan wrote.
“Seriously weekends have taken on a whole new meaning now that we are homeschool moms,” another added.
Other fans zeroed in on Jessica’s fit physique as she poses with her daughter in the water.
“Looking buff girl on #nationalfitnessday,” one fan wrote.
“You look amazing! Look at those arms!” another added.
While homeschooling may be consuming much of her week, Jessica has definitely been getting her pool time in when she can. Last week she was nearly pelted with a baseball while sunning on a float in her pool. The former Newlyweds star shared a pic of the aftermath of her son Ace’s homeroom to her Instagram page, where the “splash” showed the baseball landed right next to her float, barely missing her.
Baby Birdie has also spent a lot of time in the water. The toddler has been pictured multiple times on Jessica’s social media page as she plays with her parents in the family’s gorgeous swimming pool.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">January Jones is heating things up while at home for quarantine! The Mad Men and Last Man on Earth actress shared a series of selfies on Saturday that show herself wearing a tiny teal bikini while swimming. She revealed one in her main feed, while sharing two others in her Instagram Story. The photos served two purposes: they both wished her mom a happy birthday, and showed off her swimsuit look.
In her Story, she first shared a photo of her mom in a one-piece bikini with the caption, "Happy birthday hot mama!" before repeating a similar sentiment in her main photo's caption. She then shared two more pictures, adding the captions "Laps?" and "Don't forget your Flotation devices," swiping a cheeky comment her Spinning Out co-star Will Kemp left on her own photo. Elsewhere in the main photo's comments, the star, who also appeared in X-Men: First Class and The Politician, caught flak for wearing jewelry in the photos. Jones pointed out that "gold doesn’t rust" and she was doing "water aerobics," regardless.
The flirty photos earned a lot of praise in the comments, especially from Jones' famous peers. Mad Men co-star Kiernan Shipka wrote "[Oh my f—ing god]," and Real Housewives of Beverly Hills personality Lisa Rinna wrote "BODY." Resident Evil and Dazed and Confused actress Milla Jovovich also added, "Happy Birthday beautiful!!"
The bikini shots showed off Jones' figure, which she has been working on keeping in optimal shape. In February, the 42-year-old star opened up to Shape about her past ideas of fitness, which were lax to say the least.
“My dad was a trainer, so in my 20s and 30s, I didn’t work out, because he was always pushing my sisters, my mom, and me to exercise. We would rebel and not do it,” she she said. “It’s not that I wasn’t active. As kids, my two sisters were runners, I played tennis, and we all swam. But on a regular basis I wouldn’t work out, ever. Even when I was filming X-Men and they had trainers for all of us, I would lie and say I was exercising in my hotel room, when actually I was watching Friends and having full tea service."
However, her attitude soon changed, as she later added, "After I had my son, Xander, I wanted to feel strong because my body had changed so much. As he got bigger and I was hauling around a 20- or 30-pound toddler, my lower back gave out and I saw my shoulders starting to curl and hunch. I wanted to do something for my posture and core strength. Two or three years ago I started doing barre classes, and after that I took regular private Pilates lessons. Then a friend told me about Lagree Pilates. I’ve been doing it two to four times a week for the past year now, and I’ve gained weight because I’ve put on muscle. I’ve gone up a size in clothes, but I feel like I look better naked."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lea Michele Looks Radiant In Her First Baby Bump Pic After Previous Pregnancy Reports – It’s Confirmed!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Glee actress took to social media to share a wonderful piece of news with her many followers! As it turns out, Lea Michele is expecting her first child and she posted her very first baby bump picture on her Instagram account as proof!
That being said, it’s safe to say that the star looked radiant as she posed from a side angle to show off the belly better while in a maxi dress and wearing the most beautiful accessory – a bright smile.
This comes days after reports that she is pregnant broke out and fans were definitely very happy to see the bump for the first time.
The blue dress she had on made her look like a total goddess and people could not help but gush over her beauty in addition to congratulating her for being pregnant.
As she looked down at her bump while holding it with her hands for the pose, Lea smiled, her long hair cascading down her back.
That picture was already telling the world in a thousand words just how excited and happy she was but she still used two actual words in the caption to make it even more clear: ‘So grateful.’
As you can imagine, a lot of fellow celeb friends were really happy for her and freaked out over the news, including former Scream Queens co-star Emma Roberts, who commented: ‘Crying! Screaming!!! Love you!’
Furthermore, she also received good wishes from Maren Morris who also became a mom just last month!
The news first broke out earlier this week after a source shared with People that Lea was expecting, mentioning that she and her husband Zandy Reich ‘always wanted to be parents.’
This will be the very first time becoming parents for either of them.
Lea and Zandy were engaged for nearly a year before they tied the knot in March of 2019 and seem very happy and in love as they make this huge new step in their lives and relationship.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1, 2020
Sarah Batool Haider
Venezuelan bikini model Georgina Mazzeo recently took to her Instagram page and wowed her 1.8 million followers with a hot lingerie snapshot.
In the photo, which was uploaded on Friday, May 1, Georgina was featured rocking a pink crop top that she teamed with skimpy pink panties. The ensemble perfectly accentuated her figure, particularly showcasing her pert derriere and sexy legs. That’s not all, but the risque outfit also enabled her to put her taut stomach and enviable curves on full display.
For the snap, she stood in front of a large window and struck a side pose. She kept her cellphone on the window, turned her face toward the camera, sexily gazed at it, and flashed a soft smile.
Georgina opted for a full face of makeup to match her attire. The application featured an ivory foundation that rendered her face a flawless finish. She dusted her cheeks with a pink blush, wore light-pink lipstick, and applied a thin coat of mascara. She finished off her makeup application with defined eyebrows.
Finally, she wore her brunette tresses down and allowed them to fall over her back and shoulders.
Georgina wrote a caption in Spanish, and according to a Google translation, she stated that the pic was captured when she was about to capture a selfie but she was caught “red-handed.” She also informed her fans that her sexy attire was from the U.K.-based fashion retailer, PrettyLittleThing.
Within 12 hours of going live, and as of the writing of this article, the sexy picture has amassed more than 129,000 likes. That’s not all, but her most ardent admirers also flocked to the comments section and posted 1,000-plus comments to praise Georgina for her sexy figure and beautiful looks. Such a volume of interest shows that she is very popular on the photo-sharing website, so it should be no surprise that most of her posts instantly go viral.
“How should I tell you that I really, really like you?” one of her fans expressed his feelings.
“Did anyone ever tell you that you are the most beautiful woman on Earth?” another user chimed in.
“You are so gorgeous! This picture brightened up my day. Thanks for posting this, my lovely queen,” a third admirer remarked.
Meanwhile, a fourth user praised Georgina’s sexy ensemble.
“Those pink panties look so hot and sexy, especially on your booty,” they wrote.
Other users posted words and phrases like “goddess,” “the hottest,” and “simply amazing,” to express their admiration for the hottie.
Apart from her fans, the snap was also liked by many of her fellow models, including Dasha Mart, Laura Sanchez, and Bru Luccas.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What a joyous moment! Lea Michele, 32, confirmed her pregnancy by posting her first ever baby bump photo on Instagram on Saturday, May 2. The former Glee star looked absolutely radiant as she held onto her growing belly in a gorgeous blue dress with her brown hair cascading down her backside while beaming from ear to ear as she looked down. “So grateful,” she wrote as the caption which left many of her celeb pals and friends in an emotional state. “Crying! Screaming!!! Love you!” her former Scream Queens costar Emma Roberts, 29, wrote in the comment section. Others who wished her well includes new mommy Maren Morris, 30, who just gave birth to her first child last month. 
Lea didn’t wait too long to confirm the happy news that she’s expecting her first child with husband Zandy Reich, 36, after word broke about it earlier this week. A source told People about her bun in the oven on Monday, April 27, while adding that the twosome, “always wanted to be parents.” Lea & Zandy got married on March 9, 2019, in Napa, California after almost 1 year of being engaged. It is the first child for both of them.
The Emmy-nominated star was smart enough to conceal her baby bump in a slew of IG pics posted over the past month or so. She wore a super baggy sweatshirt in a snap of her posing in front of a mirror in early April. Many of the other photos shared were either taken from the waist up (like one with Zandy and another with her mother) or appear to be throwback ones from a while ago.
She joins in on the celebrity baby boom that’s been happening while millions of us remain in self-quarantine. Other stars that are expecting include Ashlee Simpson and Evan Ross and Chris Pratt and Katherine Schwarzenegger. Katherine’s baby bump could be seen while riding her bike with her action movie star husband in Los Angeles on Saturday, April 25.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lea Michele finally confirms pregnancy rumours with stunning bump photo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lea Michele has finally confirmed rumours that she is pregnant with her first child.
The former Glee star, 33, took to Instagram on Saturday to post a stunning picture in which she cradles her baby bump.
It comes after reports emerged that Lea and her husband Zandy Reich were expecting a child together.
And her post was the first time she had commented on the news as she posed with her growing bump on show while wearing a beautiful blue maxi dress.
In the photo Lea had a big grin on her face as she looked down at her belly.
Lea wore her brown locks loose around her shoulders and appeared to have minimal makeup on.
She posed in her garden with beautiful plants making up the scenery behind her.
To add to the natural feel of the picture, she appeared to be going barefoot in the grass.
"So grateful," Lea captioned the photo alongside a yellow love heart.
The picture was quickly flooded with well wishes from her celebrity friends.
Emma Roberts commented: "Crying! Screaming!!! Love you!"
"OMG OMG," Ashley Tishdale said with a string of pink love heart emojis.
Her Glee co-star Naya Rivera wrote: "Aww congrats! I love this. You're going to be a great mommy!"
Lea and Zandy met in 2017 and got married last year.
Rumours about her pregnancy sparked a bizarre conspiracy theory about Lea and her Glee character Rachel.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A Minute With: Tim Gunn on pajamas and post-quarantine fashion</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Even Tim Gunn, the immaculately dressed fashion mentor from “Project Runway” and Amazon’s new competition show “Making the Cut,” is finding it hard to get out of his pajamas these days. As much of the world shelters at home to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Gunn said he too has given in to comfort over style when he’s at home in his New York apartment. Reuters spoke to Gunn by telephone about how the ongoing quarantine has changed fashion and what might come next on “Making the Cut.” Q: What do you think will happen to fashion now that people have gotten used to working in sweatpants or even their pajamas? A: I have to confess to you I’m one of those people. And it’s really unusual for me. For years I’ve been saying, “if you want to dress to feel as though you never got out of bed, don’t!” But there’s a silver lining to this, at least for me. I now have a great deal of empathy for people who do dress for comfort. I’ve not been wearing sweats, but I have been wearing my pajamas, thinking “well I have no place to go.” When I actually got into regular clothes, and I did because of video conferencing, I felt as though I was wearing a wet suit. I felt so constrained and confined and tethered. I think the psychological and even physical effect of going back to normal clothes makes you just squirm. I have a good deal of empathy for people who really subscribe to the comfort trap. It’s easy to get trapped. But I do have a pact with myself. When I’m wearing pajamas and a robe, I won’t even go down the hall of my apartment building to the trash chute. If I’m leaving the apartment, I get dressed. I’m not in a suit, but I’m wearing proper clothes. Q: So what is proper clothing for you right now when you do go out in the hallway? A: I’d wear a turtleneck and a pair of jeans. Q: Do you think that once we are all allowed out into some kind of new world that there might be a huge embrace of fashion, that maybe people are tired of their sweatpants? A: I fully believe that. I know people who are dressing up every day. They’re not leaving their apartment, but they’re dressing up because they feel that they have infused their lifestyle with some normalcy. Q: Do you know if you’ll have a season two of “Making the Cut” and what it might look like? A: We’re certainly talking about a season two. The plan for doing it this summer is, of course, off. And we are carefully, thoughtfully, recalibrating all of our thinking about the show in regard to social distancing and interactions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BTS' Jungkook Covers Lauv's 'Never Not': Watch</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jungkook has fans swooning thanks to an unexpected cover of Lauv's "Never Not."
In a video posted on Twitter, the BTS member -- sitting on a bed -- sweetly sang the ballad, the closing track of Lauv's I met you when I was 18. (the playlist) project.
Jungkook left a simple caption -- "Never Not," along with a purple heart emoji -- on the clip, which ended abruptly with him turning the camera off about a minute-and-a-half into the song. At press time, his video amassed more than six million views in just a couple hours and had his name trending on Twitter.
BTS and Lauv have joined forces previously on the K-pop stars' "Make It Right" as well as "Who," off of Lauv's new album How I'm Feeling.
"I went into this album expecting no features and then they just all happened in a very natural way. I just met BTS at their show and they asked me to do the remix for their song and I was like, 'Duh.' Then I was like, 'Oh maybe they'll like one of the songs from my album.' So I sent them 'Who,' the demo, and they loved it," he recently said of their collaborations.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A YouTuber tricked celebrities into thinking they were appearing on 'The Late Late Show with James Corden'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">YouTuber Josh Pieters has had to be inventive when coming up with his social experiments during lockdown in the UK, as everything, from formulating the plan to setting it in motion, has to be done from his home in London.
However, thanks to the sudden boom in video calling, he managed to convince celebrities they were appearing on “The Late Late Show with James Corden.”
Pieters scraped many of Corden’s old interviews and video segments for sound bites and collected enough to make one side of a believable conversation. There was obviously no video feed, but the guests were told they would be chaperoned by the show’s producer, who was convincingly played by Pieters’ friend and sidekick Archie Manners.
Celebrities and their managers were none the wiser, as so many late night show hosts have been doing interviews from their own homes.
In the first of three videos in the series, British pop star Craig David and the UK’s biggest TikTok star Holly Hubert,who goes by Holly H, were interviewed. While Pieters took care of the voice notes to try and come up with a coherent flow of conversation, Manners kept things moving in his own flat across town, with the help of an imaginary assistant named “Sharon.”
They were also treated to exclusive performances. David sang one of his biggest hits, “Rise and Fall,” while Hubert demonstrated the viral TikTok dance the Renegade.
“As you know, the ‘Late Late Show with James Corden’ is on TV every night, so it’s only right that our show does the same,” Pieters said at the end of the video.
The second video featured Molly-Mae and Tommy Fury from “Love Island” and magician Julius Dein, and was posted on Saturday.
Dein sneaked in a flogging attempt for his magic box, while the couple were asked how they were getting on in quarantine.
The grand finale will air on Sunday, which you will definitely want to tune in for.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 96-year-old has wowed Britain’s Got Talent – getting the seal of approval from the judges.
Nora Barton, from West Yorkshire, took to the stage at the London Palladium.
Her daughter told the audience: “She’s sung for people all her life so at 96 this is a treat, this stage”.
After receiving a standing ovation from the judges and a huge cheer from the audience, Barton, who wore a flower in her hair and dressed in red, said: “Thank you very much”
Judge David Walliams told her: “You are a very special lady because you’re full of life, laughter and joy and have entertained the nation at 96.”
Amanda Holden said it was a “very special audition” adding: “You’re a generation this country is built on.”
Simon Cowell said: “I didn’t like you very much – I loved you! I think we’ve got about 4,000 yeses Nora.”
Barton, who sang Loveliest Night of The Year, said she was “very pleased” to have been at the auditions.
The ITV show was filmed before the coronavirus pandemic and live episodes have been postponed.
Saturday’s show also featured mother and daughter duo Sammy, 43, and Honey, 14.
Honey said the pair had experienced a “tough” couple of years because “my mum got diagnosed with cancer. ”
Sammy said she is now “absolutely fine” and Honey told the judges: “I’m so grateful for everything. I never thought that when singing along in the car it would bring us to this stage.”
After Cowell told the pair to return with a different song, they impressed the judges with a “faultless” performance.
Holden pressed the golden buzzer, saying, “It was the most wonderful thing to witness”, with Cowell adding: “I’m going to remember that audition for a long, long time.”
The show also featured a children’s choir from Hampshire who performed a song about climate change.
“You are exactly what I was hoping we would find this year,” Cowell said.

After receiving a standing ovation from the judges and a huge cheer from the audience, Barton, who wore a flower in her hair and dressed in red, said: “Thank you very much”
Judge David Walliams told her: “You are a very special lady because you’re full of life, laughter and joy and have entertained the nation at 96.”
Amanda Holden said it was a “very special audition” adding: “You’re a generation this country is built on.”
Simon Cowell said: “I didn’t like you very much – I loved you! I think we’ve got about 4,000 yeses Nora.”
Barton, who sang Loveliest Night of The Year, said she was “very pleased” to have been at the auditions.
The ITV show was filmed before the coronavirus pandemic and live episodes have been postponed.
Saturday’s show also featured mother and daughter duo Sammy, 43, and Honey, 14.
Honey said the pair had experienced a “tough” couple of years because “my mum got diagnosed with cancer. ”
Sammy said she is now “absolutely fine” and Honey told the judges: “I’m so grateful for everything. I never thought that when singing along in the car it would bring us to this stage.”
After Cowell told the pair to return with a different song, they impressed the judges with a “faultless” performance.
Holden pressed the golden buzzer, saying, “It was the most wonderful thing to witness”, with Cowell adding: “I’m going to remember that audition for a long, long time.”
The show also featured a children’s choir from Hampshire who performed a song about climate change.
“You are exactly what I was hoping we would find this year,” Cowell said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent viewers moved by 96-year-old Nora's fantastic audition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain's Got Talent fans were blown away by 96 year old Nora Barton on Saturday night's episode.
The charming singer is the show's oldest ever contestant, and arguably the most memorable of this year's hopefuls.
Nora, who came out on stage with her daughter Pam to play the piano, captured the hearts of the judges, audience and viewers at home with her wonderful singing voice.
She sang her own rendition of The Loveliest Night of the Year, which earned her a very well-deserved standing ovation from Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden, Alesha Dixon and David Walliams.
Daughter Pam explained before the audition: "She's sung for people all her life."
As soon as Nora started singing, the crowds began to cheer.
"She's into it now, isn't she?" host Dec said from behind the scenes.
Judge Alesha was super impressed, telling Nora after her performance: "Once a show woman, always a show woman!
"I really enjoyed that whole performance. It was completely charming!"
David added: "You're a very special lady because you're full of life, full of laughter, full of joy. You've entertained the nation at 96."
While Amanda said: "It was a very special audition. You're a generation that this country is built on. Very well done, and thank you."
Simon joked that he didn't like the act, before proudly announcing: "I loved you!"
It goes without saying that viewers loved the audition, with many taking to Twitter to share their thoughts.
One wrote: "Right. I love Nora already."
"Aww Nora," another tweeted, "What an angel!"
A third exclaimed: "GIVE NORA THE GOLDEN BUZZER!"
A fourth gushed: "Wasn't emotionally prepared for Nora! #BGT."
While a fifth admitted: "GO ON NORA! 96 years old and singing like that, what a woman!"
A sixth viewer was moved to tears, writing: "How lovely was that on BGT. Nora and her daughter Pam. Brought tears to my eyes."
Britain's Got Talent continues next Saturday at 8pm on ITV and Virgin Media One.

Nora, who was accompanied by her daughter Pam sang a beautiful version of The Loveliest Night Of The Year from the film The Great Caruso.
But before she began to sing she had a chat with the judges.
Amanda Holden asked: ‘Dare I ask how old you are?’
Although Nora couldn’t quite hear Amanda as she turned to her daughter and said: ‘What did she say?’
Her daughter answered: ‘She’s 96.’
The judge then asked: ‘How long have you been playing the piano?’
Nora shakes her head and points to Pam as she said ‘Oh not me, she does.’
‘She has sung for people all of her life,’ Pam explained.
‘And at 96, this is a treat, this stage, the London Palladium.’
No Nora you are the treat!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRITAIN’S Got Talent has seen many worthy acts grace its stage but this series one woman has stood out amongst others – Nora Barton, the oldest ever contestant on the show.
And now viewers of the show want the glorious pensioner to win after her utterly charming performance.
Fans were bowled over tonight by 96-year-old Nora Barton, Britain's Got Talent's oldest ever contestant, who fulfilled her dream of performing at the London Palladium.
Nora, who has Alzheimer's, left the judges, audience and viewers blown away by her performance, and fans at home think she should win the show.
The 96-year-old already had viewers hooked when she quipped to host Ant McPartlin that she was doing “nowt” when he asked her what she was up to on stage.
Helped on stage by Ant, Nora’s daughter Pam Dimbleby, 65, who accompanied her, revealed it was a dream for her mother to play there.
The great-grandmother was dressed to impress in a red top, floral skirt and a flower in her hair, before she belted out The Loveliest Night Of The Year from 1951 film The Great Caruso, with daughter Pam playing along on piano.
The nonagenarian was left thrilled as she was given a standing ovation, with Nora saying “thank you very much!”
Fans at home were as equally enthused, taking to Twitter to write: “Nora.... Hands down winner for tonight’s show' declared one viewer.”
While a second added: “OMG! I think she's the winner! Such a lovely lady with a beautiful voice. We have Colin, now we need Nora. The Royal family would adore her. Smiling face with open mouthRed heart #BGT”
And a third concluded: “I've fallen for Nora on #BritainsGotTalent surely she is a winner! Her Royal Highness our Queen of England would love her”
All the judges fell in love with Nora tonight as David Walliams told her: “You are a very special lady because you are full of life, full of laughter, full of joy and you've just entertained the nation at 96.”
Before Alesha Dixon declared: “Once a show woman, always a show woman! I really enjoyed that whole performance, it was just completely charming! Congratulations Nora!”

They did it, and he's OK, and he is free of the ventilator," she said.She added: "We have been trying to do this for Nick for so many weeks now, and it just kept getting stalled and pushed back because of his health."Doctors previously planned to take the Rock of Ages star off the ventilator last week, but he developed a fever soon after his leg amputation, which delayed the procedure.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Nick Cordero’s Wife Reveals Her Husband Was Taken Off Ventilator Following COVID-19 Struggle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nick Cordero was recently taken off of a ventilator, his wife, Amanda Kloots revealed. According to Page Six, who was the first to pick up on her Instagram Stories, Nick was taken off the ventilator and he’s on the “trach,” as Amanda put it.
According to Kloots, her 41-year-old husband had to undergo a tracheostomy for the sake of moving away from the ventilator. Page Six reported that the process involves the creation of a hole in an individual’s throat to make room for an oxygen tube.
Kloots said on her IG stories that doctors were waiting for Nick’s condition to get better before they did the procedure, and over the last few weeks, they decided he was finally strong enough to go through with it.
The fitness trainer said before her followers that Nick’s doctors had been trying to do it for a long time now, but they kept having to push it back on account of his condition. As it was previously reported, Nick has been in intensive care since the beginning of April.
There’s no question the Broadway star has struggled to beat COVID-19, which led to serious complications, including the necessitation of an amputation. On the 24th of April, doctors discovered that the virus was finally out of his system, but they had more work to do.
Earlier this week, on Friday, Amanda said on her IG that Nick was finally going to go through with the operation and she was thrilled about it. The 39-year-old fitness trainer has been documenting Nick’s recovery ever since the symptoms began worsening. They have a 10-month-old son named Elvis.
On the 30th of April, Bridget Hill reported on Amanda’s IG Story in which she said Nick was suffering from a low red-blood-cell count. This wasn’t that long after his amputation. Doctors decided it was best to remove his leg due to complications from blood-thinning medication that was needed to prevent clotting, which may have traveled into his heart and killed him.
Fortunately, this all seems to be behind him, and Nick may be on the road to a full recovery in the ensuing weeks.

Nick Cordero has been in the ICU for at least a month fighting complications related to the coronavirus and on Friday his wife was ecstatic to share a positive update with fans regarding his health.
Kloots took to her Instagram story, as she's been doing daily since he was placed in a medically-induced coma weeks ago, to share that he was finally able to get off of a ventilator by undergoing a tracheotomy.
"He is on the trach! They did it and he's ok! And he is free of the ventilator. Thank God. We have been trying to do this for Nick for so many weeks now and it just kept getting stalled and pushed back because of his health and now he was finally healthy enough today to get the trach and the ventilator is out," Kloots said with a big smile on her face.
HOW DANGEROUS IS CORONAVIRUS?
The Broadway star's wife explained that while he is still on "assisted breathing" the procedure is "amazing news because we really needed this to happen."
Kloots shared that she believes Cordero will be "feeling better" and that the procedure is hopefully a sign of "some good recovery days ahead."
Earlier in the week, Kloots admitted Nick had a "rough day" as his body went into septic shock due to an infection in his lungs that spread to his blood.
She added that Cordero is "slowly weening" off of the blood pressure medication and he is now on a "really strong" antibiotic to help kick the infection.

Last week, Cordero received a temporary pacemaker following an amputation of his right leg. His last two coronavirus tests came back negative but doctors believe the virus is where his health troubles all began.
Cordero has starred in "Blue Bloods," "Going in Style" and "A Stand Up Guy" among several other acting credits.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Broadway star Nick Cordero taken off ventilator, his wife says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Broadway star Nick Cordero has been taken off a ventilator after undergoing a successful procedure to insert a breathing tube, his wife said.
Tony Award-nominated Cordero was placed in intensive care shortly after being admitted to a Los Angeles hospital in March suffering with coronavirus.
Last month the 41-year-old had his leg amputated due to complications from the illness and he had been on a ventilator after his lungs were left “severely damaged”.
His wife, Amanda Kloots, has been sharing updates with fans on social media and on Friday revealed a tracheostomy tube had been successfully inserted into his neck, allowing him to come off the ventilator.
Kloots said on Instagram: “We have been trying to do this for Nick for so many weeks now and it just kept getting stalled and pushed back because of his health and now he was finally healthy enough today to get the trach and the ventilator is out.
“This is just amazing news because we really needed this to happen to get him off that ventilator. I think he will be feeling better, even subconsciously feeling better.
“I hope this is just a great sign for some good recovery days ahead and for him to wake up and just have that pressure relief from his throat. Thank God.”
Cordero, a father of one, was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre in Los Angeles after testing positive for Covid-19.
His wife has been leading the #WakeUpNick campaign, which has been backed by several celebrities, including his close friend the actor Zach Braff.
Cordero played a mob soldier in 2014 Broadway show Bullets Over Broadway, for which he received a Tony nomination for best featured actor in a musical.
His TV roles include Blue Bloods and Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As if it wasn't already ubiquitous, Megan Thee Stallion just catapulted her latest single, "Savage." The rapper just released a remix featuring Beyoncé, with proceeds benefiting coronavirus relief efforts in their shared hometown of Houston.
The remix, which has all the makings of a song of the summer, offers a rare instance of Beyoncé rapping. ("Diva," "Feeling Myself," and "Apesh*t" are other notable instances that come to mind.) In a verse alluding to the song's popularity on TikTok, Beyoncé says, "Hips tick-tock when I dance." Another lyric practically primed for an Instagram caption goes, "If you don't jump to put jeans on / Baby, you don't feel my pain." Listen to the song above before it soon becomes inescapable.

"When you're on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri," Babil captioned the video posted on Instagram.
Irrfan breathed his last early on Wednesday at the age of 54. He was admitted to Mumbai's Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital with a colon infection earlier this week. The actor is survived by his wife Sutapa Sikdar and two sons Babil and Ayan.
Following his death, Babil took to Instagram to express gratitude towards everyone for sending their condolences.
"I'm deeply grateful for all the condolences you beautiful friends are pouring in for me. Although, I hope you understand that right now I'm no being able to reply because my vocabulary is dizzy," he wrote.
"I will get back to each one of you but just not right now. Thank you so much! I love you," he added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan left a gaping hole in not just Bollywood, but in world cinema as a whole! While fans were shattered when news broke out of the Maqbool actor passing away, it was his family who mourns the most. While the late actor’s wife
wrote an emotional letter on the actor’s demise, his son Babil too shared his heartfelt condolences.
But today, Babil has taken to his social media handle to share yet another post of his father and the veteran Irrfan Khan. While Khan looks content in the video as he relishes Pani Puri at a fancy restaurant, we can’t stop our tears from flowing.
Babil took to his Instagram handle to share the video with a caption that read, “When you’re on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri.”
Fans of Irrfan Khan are however heartbroken as they see this video with some of the commenting,” For a second mujhe laga jaise he is there. Kuch hua hi na ho (feels like nothing ever happened). Love and power to sutapa ji, you and Ayan.”
Meanwhile, Babil also took to his social media handle to thank all the fans of the late Irrfan Khan for their prayers and condolences. He wrote on his Instagram story, “I’m deeply grateful for all the condolences you beautiful friends are pouring in for me. Although I hope you understand that right now I’m not being able to reply because my vocabolary is dizzy. I will get back to each one of you but just not right now. Thank you so much. I love you.”
Irrfan Khan had a long and painful battle against cancer to which he eventually succumbed yesterday at the Kokilaben Ambani hospital, where he was admitted for a colon infection.
On the professional front, Irrfan Khan was last seen in Angrezi Medium alongside Kareena Kapoor Khan, Deepak Dobriyal, Radhika Madan, and Dimple Kapadia in pivotal roles. The Indian Cinema gem was one of the few actors to be a part of several Oscar-winning films.
Our heart reaches out to Irrfan Khan’s family and may God bless them with strength and courage to deal with these difficult days.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fans turn emotional as Irrfan Khan's son Babil shares an unseen video of the actor enjoying pani-puri</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan’s son Babil posted an unseen video of his father enjoying pani-puri at a restaurant and fans soon started missing the legendary actor. Irrfan was captured enjoying a hearty meal in the video which Babil had captioned, “When you’re on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri.” Fans of the actor flooded the post with emotional comments, expressing grief and strength to the late actor’s family.
Irrfan Khan passed away on Wednesday after a battle with neuroendocrine cancer for over two years. In a gratitude note, the actor’s wife Sutapa expressed that it was not a loss but a gain of the things that he taught them. She shared, “How can I write this as a family statement when the whole world is taking it as a personal loss? How can I begin to feel alone when millions are grieving with us at the moment? I want to assure everyone that this is not a loss, it is a gain. It’s a gain of the things he taught us, and now we shall finally begin to truly implement it and evolve. Yet I want to try to fill in the things that people don’t already know. Funnily, our life was a masterclass in acting, so when the dramatic entry of the ‘uninvited guests’ happened, I had by then learnt, to see a harmony in the cacophony. The doctor’s reports were like scripts which I wanted to perfect, so I never miss any detail that he sought for in his performance. We met some amazing people in this journey and the list is endless, but there are some whom I have to mention, our oncologist Dr. Nitesh Rohtogi (Max hospital Saket) who held our hand in the beginning, Dr. Dan Krell (UK), Dr. Shidravi (UK), my heartbeat and my lantern in the dark Dr. Sevanti Limaye (Kokilaben hospital).”
“I see my little family, in a boat, with both my sons Babil and Ayaan, paddling it forward, with Irrfan guiding them ‘wahan nahi, yahan se modo’ but since life is not cinema and there are no retakes, I sincerely wish my children sail this boat safely with their father’s guidance in mind and rockabye through the storm,” Sutapa added in the note.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WWE superstar John Cena pays homage to Irrfan Khan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WWE superstar John Cena shared a post on social media for Bollywood legend Irrfan Khan, who passed away on April 29 after a prolonged battle with cancer.
Cena, who is a 16-time WWE champion, is now a full-time actor. However, the Cenation leader has never worked with Irrfan, who featured in several Hollywood films. Irrfan’s first big break was in British Indian filmmaker Asif Kapadia’s film The Warrior (2001).
Cena’s tribute to Irrfan has gained a lot of attention on social media. A couple of days back, Cena had also posted a photo of late Bollywood actor Rishi Kapoor. Here is Cena’s post for the Bollywood legend-
When he visited The Indian Express in 2013, the actor, who had already won a Padma Shri for his acting performances, said he had chosen to pursue acting over sports since he felt he could pursue it for longer.
In 2017, Irrfan appeared on the chat show Son of Abish and spoke about his love for sports and how he was forced to give up on cricket.
“I wanted to become a cricketer and make a career out of it. I was an all-rounder and the youngest one in my team in Jaipur. While I did love batting more, our captain liked my bowling and thereby made me a bowler,” said Irrfan, a self-proclaimed MS Dhoni fan.
He is survived by his wife, Sutapa Sikder, and sons Babil and Ayan. He last appeared in Hindi film Angrezi Medium, a sequel to the hit Hindi Medium that he had starred in.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Amitabh Bachchan calls Irrfan Khan's death 'tragic', posts video tribute for Rishi Kapoor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Megastar Amitabh Bachchan believes the demise of his "Piku" co-star Irrfan Khan is "tragic" because his potential as an actor was left "unrealised".
The 77-year-old actor on Saturday posted a tribute to both Irrfan and veteran actor Rishi Kapoor who died within a day of each other after their respective battles with cancer.
In the post on Instagram, Bachchan touched upon "the death of an elder celebrity vs death of a younger one" topic.
"The death of an elder celebrity vs death of a younger... the grief of the latter more intense than that of the former... Why...? The younger more tragic?
"Why the loss of the young seems more tragic than that of the older? Because you lament the loss of opportunity in the latter... unrealised possibilities," the megastar wrote.
Irrfan, 54, lost his battle with a rare form of cancer and died in a Mumbai hospital on Wednesday. The actor was popular for his stellar performances in films such as "Maqbool", "The Warrior", "Paan Singh Tomar", The Namesake", "Jurassic World" and "Hindi Medium".
A veteran of Bollywood with over 150 films to credits during his five decade long career, Rishi died on Thursday at HN Reliance hospital here after a two year long battle with leukaemia.
On Friday, Bachchan posted a video tribute to Rishi, with whom he acted in films such as "Kabhie Kabhie", "Amar Akbar Anthony", "Naseeb", "Coolie", "Ajooba" and "102 Not Out".
The over five-minute-long black-and-white video features various stills from "102 Not Out". Bachchan can be heard singing a rendition of classic song "Waqt ne kiya kya haseen sitam" in the background.
The megastar wrote in the caption, "Waqt.. Waqt ne kiya kya haseen sitam .. Tum rahe na tum, hum rahe na hum."

Violet Johnson, who has lived in the city for 30 years, and her sister May O'Neil, who lives in a care home in Essex, were born on May 3, 1920.
Although birthday party plans had to be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, the sisters did manage to mark the occasion by speaking to each other via FaceTime this afternoon.
Violet's daughter Celia Twining said she was "extremely proud" of both her mother and auntie for reaching such a grand age.
Celia, 70, said: "We're very, very proud of them as a family; it is a real achievement for twins to reach 100.
"The special family celebrations have been postponed until later in the year. This has been exceedingly sad and disappointing for everyone but no-one wanted to risk possibly passing on coronavirus to either May or Vi.
"It is a real shame that they couldn't be together today. They did have a FaceTime call with each other at 2.30pm.
"Vi's two carers, who have just started supporting her at home, have taken in a cake and flowers from the family.
"May has been in a care home, only for the last few months, where the caring and attentive staff helped with her birthday celebrations."
The twins grew up in Essex, left school aged 14, and worked at Lamson Paragon, an office equipment and stationery firm in Canning Town.
They both trained as air raid wardens and did that job for a short time during the Second World War.
May later worked in a draper’s shop in the 50s and 60s, while Violet ran a nursery school for five years.
Violet married and had four children with Joseph Johnson, a lay reader, who died in 1992. Today, she has seven grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.
May had one daughter with husband Barney O'Neil, a barge builder, who died in 1972.
While the absence of visitors during the UK's lockdown has proved tough for the twins, Celia says her mother is keeping busy through cooking and knitting.
Celia, who lives in Brighton, said: "The impact of lockdown for May has been the absence of visitors to her care home, which has been tough for her daughter especially and all those who would like to see her.
"Vi is a very kind, loving and generous person, who really enjoys talking to people. She is still in contact with many people she knew 50 years ago.
"The absence of visitors is also an issue for Vi, but she now has carers and continues to enjoy cooking and loves knitting, which is her hobby. It is a treat to be given one of her Aran jumpers!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">90-year-old Irish woman raises over €16,000 with charity dance-a-thon</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AN ELDERLY Irish woman celebrated her 90th birthday this weekend with a solo dance-a-thon raising much-needed funds for charity. 
Kathleen Lynch, from Blackrock, Co Louth,  originally planned on celebrating her landmark birthday with a special meal in the company of her 94-year-old husband Donnie and an extended family that includes 13 grandchildren and 14 great grandchildren. 
Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic put paid to that, instead forcing Kathleen and Donnie to cocoon at home from early March in order to protect themselves from the deadly virus. 
But the great-grandmother has been keeping busy. 
For the past few weeks, she had been practicing her moves ahead of a 90-minute dance-a-thon which was held in the back garden of her home this past Saturday, May 1 - her birthday. 
Last August, shortly after their 68th wedding anniversary, Donnie and Kathleen were suffered a horrific attack at their doorstep. 
The incident left the couple understandably shaken. 
However, with the love and support of their friends, family and the local community, the Lynchs were able to overcome the incident and return to their beloved home. 
This dance-a-thon was Kathleen’s way of giving something back to that same community. 
"I just want to lift the spirits of anyone and everyone during these gloomy days," she told RTE in the build-up to the big day. 
Beginning at midday, the dance-a-thon reached its climax just after 3pm – 3:09 in fact, which was the exact time Kathleen was born back in 1930 – when followers were invited to join in. 
She made quite the impression too with thousands getting involved from home and a few even paying her a visit - while maintaining the necessary social distance, of course. 
At the beginning of her journey, Kathleen set herself a fundraising target of €1,000. 
To date, she has raised €16,700 with those funds set to be split between two charities close to her heart: the Irish Red Cross and Age Action. 
Age Action has launched a COVID-19 Hardship Fund in conjunction with the Irish Red Cross to respond to the immediate needs of older people in vulnerable situations experiencing additional hardship as a result of COVID-19.   
Irish Red Cross are also supporting the Front-Line Staff accessing needs in the Hospitals across Ireland. 
Speaking to Breaking News, her daughter, Geraldine, said that Kathleen has been “completely humbled” by the support she has received. 
“How it all started was that she said she didn’t want anything for her birthday because of the situation in Ireland at the minute and then she said if we wanted to do something would we give money to a charity that needed it at this time,” she said. 
"So she chose the two charities because they were dealing with the fund for older people.” 
Anyone wishing to donate to Kathleen’s efforts can do so here.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An elderly Irish woman has raised thousands for charity by holding a dance celebration on her 90th birthday.
Kathleen Lynch, from Blackrock, Co Louth, has raised over €16,400 ($18,195) for Age Action and the Irish Red Cross.
Lynch’s family had initially planned a hotel party to mark the momentous occasion, but the event had to be canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to RTÉ.

Not to be deterred, the great-grandmother thought she would have a one-woman, 90-minute dance party in her back yard starting at midday on her May 1st birthday, reaching a crescendo at 3:09 to make the exact time she was born in 1930.
Lynch, who has been staying at home with her 94-year-old husband Donnie, then decided to ask the rest of Ireland to join her for a one-minute dance at the exact time of her birth and set up a GoFundMe page to raise funds for the two charities.
She chose the Irish Red Cross and Age Action, which set up a hardship fund in March to help the elderly experiencing added financial stress due to the coronavirus crisis. The huge number of applications has overwhelmed the fund, so Lynch’s fundraising efforts are especially welcome, according to BreakingNews.ie.
Lynch's initial aim was to raise €1,000, but she has raised over €16,400 ($18,195) to date!
According to Lynch’s daughter Geraldine, her mother was “completely humbled” by the outpouring of support.
“How it all started was that she said she didn’t want anything for her birthday because of the situation in Ireland at the minute and then she said if we wanted to do something would we give money to a charity that needed it at this time,” said Geraldine.

“So she chose the two charities because they were dealing with the fund for older people.”
Red Cross paramedics, gardaí, and even a couple of nuns stopped by Lynch’s home to lend their support over the course of the afternoon, The Irish Times reports. Some of Lynch’s local family and friends were also in attendance ( while observing social distancing restrictions).
"I just want to lift the spirits of anyone and everyone during these gloomy days," said Lynch.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lily Allen was thrown a stunning birthday surprise by her doting family while in lockdown.
The singer, who turned 35 on Saturday, was treated to a lavish lockdown celebration by her boyfriend David Harbour and her daughters Ethel, eight, and Marnie, seven.
Documenting the adorable moment on social media, the Not Fair singer recorded a trail of rose petals that had been laid around the floor of her home.
Lily followed the pink and red petals as they led her to a beautifully decorated room full of birthday gifts and flowers.
She let out an excited scream as her loved ones sang to her on her special day.
Alongside the Instagram clip, the mum-of-two also pointed out that she shared her birthday with a several other celebrities.
"Happy Birthday to Princess Charlotte, David Beckham, @rexkudo and Donatella Versace but mainly me," she wrote in her social media caption.
The musician has since been inundated with birthday wishes from her fans as she celebrated her birthday in lockdown.
Although today marked the main celebrations, it appears that Lily has been gearing up for her birthday and even received some early presents ahead of her big day.
Two days earlier, Lily posted a picture of an enormous bouquet of red roses that she had received as an early present.
The letter 'L' was spelled out in white roses as part of her personal gift.
Lily and David recently have sparked rumours of an engagement after the pop star was spotted wearing a ring in several social media pictures.
The lovebirds have been dating since January 2018 and are currently enjoying lockdown together.
Although the songstress set tongues wagging, neither her nor David have confirmed they are engaged.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Adorable moment ecstatic pensioner, 92, meets her great grandchild for the first time from the upstairs window of her home after being stuck inside on lockdown for seven weeks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This is the adorable moment an ecstatic pensioner meets her great grandchild for the first time from the upstairs window of her house after seven weeks of being stuck inside.
Joan Cartwright, 92, was delighted after her grandson, Will and his wife, Jen, came round to introduce her to her sixth great-grandchild Holly.
She flung her arms out through the open window of her flat in Horsforth, Leeds as Will, 36, stood in the garden below and held up his baby so Joan could see her.
The couple said the surprise visit was an 'emotional moment' as she shouted down: 'I hope I can hold her one day.' 
Joan lost her husband Ron a few years ago and has not left her flat for almost seven weeks to protect herself from catching the virus.  
Will, a chartered town planner, told The Mirror: 'We don't know how old Holly will be before she can properly meet our parents and grandparents.
'My Nanna doesn't have a smartphone or computer or anything. She doesn't have Wifi so it's quite difficult. She was delighted when we rang her and said we were outside. 
'She doesn't have her own garden. She's stuck inside and she isn't seeing anyone, except for things being dropped off.'
Holly was born at Airedale General Hospital on March 13 - just 10 days before the lockdown began. 
Holly is Will's second child with Jen, 34, an HR business partner at a university. They also have two-year-old Noah. 
Jen said it was very emotional, adding that it was hard for Joan as she is so used to having the grandchildren around for tea.    
The couple had sent her some pictures in the post of baby Holly, which she put on the mantelpiece. 
Joan's daughter, Judith Waterworth, lives nearby and has been doing regular food deliveries for her mother as well as talking to her through the window. 
Joan has been keeping busy doing crosswords and competitions, watching films and trying not to watch the news too much.
She added: 'I'm missing everyone lots and can't wait to get all the family together once this is all over.'

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lisa Armstrong has shared a stunning makeover snap after shaking free of her marriage to Ant McPartlin.
The 43-year-old looked gorgeous in a natural selfie which showed off her ageless skin and slick blonde do - just a week after her divorce from Ant Mcpartlin was finalised, two years after they began proceedings.
She captioned the shot: "All dressed up and nowhere to go!!! #Quiznight #Thursdayisthenewsaturday #Stayhome #Staysafe #Nofilter."
The award winning make-up artist looked perfect with styled lashes and flawless foundation - proving her single status suits her.
It has been a long road for Lisa, who maintained a dignified silence since her split - only sharing a handful of tweets and likes.
She recently liked tweet from a fan who suggested that she had been "cheated on."
The fan tweeted: "Good luck for your future I split with my man 2 years ago after 19 years as he had an affair. I was broken hearted and still am but I have to keep smiling. So looking at you smiling makes me smile and I then know I have to carry on.x."
Ant and Lisa's marriage fell apart in January 2018, five months after he left rehab and 12 years after they married in 2006.
A decree nisi was agreed over Ant's adultery with Anne-Marie Corbett, though it was on the basis that it was agreed that the relationship didn't begin until after he had separated from Lisa.
The divorce has paved the way for Ant to marry mum-of-two Anne-Marie, his former PA that he has described as his "rock".
A source said: “Ant’s been desperate to start the next chapter of his life and at least now he and Anne-Marie can plan for the future. It won’t be long before they are married.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Black Panther' screenwriter Joe Robert Cole on directing his gritty new Netflix movie 'All Day and a Night'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At 40 years old, Joe Robert Cole is one of the most sought after screenwriters working today in Hollywood thanks to his work in TV (“The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story”) and movies (“Black Panther”).
But for his latest project, he’s moving away from helping the vision of people like Ryan Murphy and Ryan Coogler to set out and direct his own story.
“All Day and a Night” (available on Netflix) is an unforgiving look at Jahkor (Aston Sanders of “Moonlight”), an Oakland kid who is trying to make a better life for his newborn baby with his skills as a rapper but finds himself falling into a life of crime that puts him in jail alongside his gang banging father, James (Jeffrey Wright).
This a story that Cole wanted to tell long before “Black Panther” was made. A decade to be exact. And it’s in many ways the first time audiences will get something that comes directly from Cole (even for his directorial debut, “Amber Lake,” he admits the project was very collaborative with the actors).
“I view myself as a super collaborative person,” Cole told Insider with a laugh. “Yes, this is my film, it’s definitely different than what I’ve done. But I love collaboration. Creating something greater than you can on your own.”
But for the first time in his career, he’s the tone in the director’s chair, which means he’s the one with the final say and the vision – regardless of the amount of collaboration. And for “All Day and a Night,” he set out to give an unforgiving look at what he observed growing up around the San Francisco Bay area.
“My grandmother used to say, ‘Our family didn’t grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths.'”
The light bulb for “A Day and a Night” really came into focus when Cole was in college at the University of California, Berkeley.
“I spent a lot of time between classes and semesters with people in these same environments that are in the movie,” Cole said. “I’m a square so I make no claims to having any kind of street crew, but I got to see the humanity in these people that I was interacting with.”
And Cole said that’s the biggest thing he wants people to take away from the journey we see Jahkor go on in the movie. To see “the people in those communities in a more humane light.”
Though the comparison to a raw inner-city crime movie like “Menace II Society” is expected by Cole (and he admits he probably mentioned that movie when pitching it to Netflix), he also hopes it can stand on its own. Especially in how it depicts the characters of Jahkor and James in prison.
“My film isn’t about the black community, just like a white crime film isn’t about all white people,” Cole said. “What Jah is grappling with is trying to understand how the systemic walls that are put around him outside of prison, in his community, are not that different than the walls he sees inside prison. It is him trying to find hope in the one place that he can control through the journey of this film which is inside himself. That’s the thrust of what I’m trying to get at.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Black Panther’ screenwriter Joe Robert Cole on directing his gritty new Netflix movie ‘All Day and a Night’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">At 40 years old, Joe Robert Cole is one of the most sought after screenwriters working today in Hollywood thanks to his work in TV (“The People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story”) and movies (“Black Panther”).
But for his latest project, he’s moving away from helping the vision of people like Ryan Murphy and Ryan Coogler to set out and direct his own story.
“All Day and a Night” (available on Netflix) is an unforgiving look at Jahkor (Aston Sanders of “Moonlight”), an Oakland kid who is trying to make a better life for his newborn baby with his skills as a rapper but finds himself falling into a life of crime that puts him in jail alongside his gang banging father, James (Jeffrey Wright).
This a story that Cole wanted to tell long before “Black Panther” was made. A decade to be exact. And it’s in many ways the first time audiences will get something that comes directly from Cole (even for his directorial debut, “Amber Lake,” he admits the project was very collaborative with the actors).
“I view myself as a super collaborative person,” Cole told Insider with a laugh. “Yes, this is my film, it’s definitely different than what I’ve done. But I love collaboration. Creating something greater than you can on your own.”
But for the first time in his career, he’s the tone in the director’s chair, which means he’s the one with the final say and the vision – regardless of the amount of collaboration. And for “All Day and a Night,” he set out to give an unforgiving look at what he observed growing up around the San Francisco Bay area.
“My grandmother used to say, ‘Our family didn’t grow up with a silver spoon in our mouths.'”
The light bulb for “A Day and a Night” really came into focus when Cole was in college at the University of California, Berkeley.
“I spent a lot of time between classes and semesters with people in these same environments that are in the movie,” Cole said. “I’m a square so I make no claims to having any kind of street crew, but I got to see the humanity in these people that I was interacting with.”
And Cole said that’s the biggest thing he wants people to take away from the journey we see Jahkor go on in the movie. To see “the people in those communities in a more humane light.”
Though the comparison to a raw inner-city crime movie like “Menace II Society” is expected by Cole (and he admits he probably mentioned that movie when pitching it to Netflix), he also hopes it can stand on its own. Especially in how it depicts the characters of Jahkor and James in prison.
“My film isn’t about the black community, just like a white crime film isn’t about all white people,” Cole said. “What Jah is grappling with is trying to understand how the systemic walls that are put around him outside of prison, in his community, are not that different than the walls he sees inside prison. It is him trying to find hope in the one place that he can control through the journey of this film which is inside himself. That’s the thrust of what I’m trying to get at. There are these societal structural challenges that particularly African-Americans in these underserved communities have to face. I feel oftentimes no one speaks to the reality of the circumstance they are in.”

Kayla Moody took to her Instagram account on Saturday night to share yet another racy snap with her loyal fans. The model showcased her beach body as she revealed her cooking skills.
In the sexy post, Kayla rocked a very revealing mismatched bikini. The gray top fastened behind her neck and around her back while flaunting her toned arms and shoulders. The garment also featured a low cut neckline to flash her colossal cleavage. The bikini top was so tiny that it caused her to have a wardrobe malfunction.
The pink and blue bottoms tied around Kayla’s curvy hips and put her tiny waist, flat tummy, and impressive abs on full display. Fans also got a peek at her long, lean legs in the pic.
Kayla posed in front of a barbecue grill as she cooked some steaks over the flame. She held a pair of tongs in her hand and adjusted the knob in front of her as she wore a seductive expression on her face. In the background of the snap a hot tub and beach towels can be seen.
Kayla wore her long, blond hair in a deep side part and styled in loose waves that fell down her back and brushed lightly over her shoulders.
She opted for a full face of makeup. The application included thick mascara-covered lashes and black eyeliner. She added pink eye shadow and sculpted brows as well.
She drew even more attention to her features by sporting pink blush on the apples of her cheeks and a shimmering highlighter on her forehead, nose, and under eyes. She completed the look with soft pink lipstick.
Kayla’s 703,000-plus followers didn’t hesitate to share their appreciation for the post, clicking the like button more than 10,000 times within the first three hours after its upload. Fans also swarmed the comments section with over 400 remarks about the photo.
“Wow beautiful picture absolutely stunning,” one follower wrote.
“You look good! Baby your so beautiful! Well done!!” another stated.
“Oh WOW you really are my perfect woman,” a third social media user gushed.
“The perfect girl,” a fourth person commented.
Kayla is known for dropping the jaws of her fans in barely-there outfits such as see-through tops, skintight dresses, and racy lingerie.
As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Kayla most recently delighted her followers when she rocked a skimpy sports bra and a pair of black spandex shorts as she prepared for a workout. To date, that snap has raked in more than 9,500 likes and over 200 comments.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lili Reinhart, 23, got some fresh air and showed off her toned physique on May 1 when she was spotted running errands in Los Angeles, CA. The Riverdale actress looked awesome in a white T-shirt, denim shorts aka Daisy Dukes, and pink sandals during the outing. She also made sure to protect herself during the coronavirus pandemic by wearing a face mask and gloves as she had her hair pulled back.
Some of the blonde beauty’s errands during her time out of quarantine included a stop at her storage unit to pick up some clothes and she was also spotted with her real estate agent while house-hunting in the City of Angels. She looked cool and comfortable as she let her sunglasses sit on top of her head for some parts of the outing but made sure to put them on when she walked in the sun.
Lili’s latest outing comes after she made headlines for standing up for her boyfriend Cole Sprouse, 27, after Twitter users tried to “cancel” him by making “#colesprouseisoverparty” trend on the social media app for an unclear reason. “Twitter is such a vile place,” Lili wrote in one of several now-deleted tweets. “It’s so easy to say s–t behind your f–king phone, isn’t it? This is why people choose to keep their relationships private… this is why people don’t have social media.. because of this bullying.” She went on to admit that she doesn’t “tolerate” online bullying. “I don’t tolerate any of that s–t. Bully me? Sure fine,” she said. “But attacking someone for literally no reason, just for the sake of a f–king twitter trend? Please…. reassess yourself and your ego before you send another tweet into the abyss.”
We’re glad Lili’s not letting quarantine stop her from looking for a house or standing up for her beau! We hope to see more of her soon.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Natalie Gauvreau Shows Off Major Skin In Crop Top And Beach Pants On Instagram</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Sarah Batool Haider
Canadian model Natalie Gauvreau, who uses the moniker “Sexy Nat G” on Instagram, recently took to her page and teased her 4.8 million fans with a set of skin-baring snapshots.
In the pics, she could be seen rocking a purple mini windbreaker that she teamed with matching beach pants from the brand Gecko Hawaii. To spice things up, Natalie lifted the crop top to show off major underboob while she also naughtily pulled her pants down to show draw viewers’ attention toward her sculpted abs. The move revealed that she was wearing no undergarments underneath the ensemble. The snap can be viewed on Instagram.
Staying true to her style, she sported a full face of makeup. The application featured a beige foundation that rendered Natalie’s skin a perfect matte finish. She dusted her cheeks with a pink blush combined with some highlighter, wore a nude lipstick, opted fro heavily lined eyes, and a thick coat of mascara applied over false eyelashes.
She wore her blond tresses down and allowed them to cascade over her shoulders and ample bosoms.
According to the geotag, the snaps were captured in Toronto, Canada. For the photoshoot, Natalie stood in her room, and to the excitement of her fans, she shared not one, not two, but four snaps from the photoshoot.
In the first pic, she stood straight, pulled her pants down to expose her lower torso, and gazed at the camera. In the second one, she slightly tilted her body, kept a hand on her neck, and flashed a soft smile. In the third snap, she tugged at her pants but this time, she lowered her top to hide her underboob. In the fourth and final photo, Natalie struck a side pose and provided her fans with an eyeful of underboob, her taut stomach, and her lower torso.
In the caption, she asked her fans which one of the pics they like the most. Within 15 hours of going live, the snap garnered more than 148,000 likes and over 4,700 comments.
“I like the second pic the best because I can see your face better,” one of her fans commented on the snap.
“I choose all four [of the pics] because you are a very, very beautiful and attractive woman,” another user chimed in.
“Damn, you are so hot Natalie. Can I quarantine with you, please?” a third admirer requested.
Meanwhile, a fourth follower praised Natalie’s body.
“Those abs are everything. Simply amazing!” they wrote.
Other fans posted words and phrases like “I am speechless,” “extremely sexy,” and “what a babe,” to express their admiration for Natalie.
The snap was also liked by many other models and influencers, including Eriana Blanco, Tina Louise, Francia James, and Rianna Conner Carpenter.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Anna Harnes
Royal insiders are claiming that Meghan Markle is about to launch a new lifestyle website as part of her life as living as a non-royal. The royal gossip come as the Sussexes have begun their life outside of the royal family after formally leaving on March 31. The two have since moved to Los Angeles with their son, Archie.
According to Page Six, royal expert Myka Meier claimed that she believed that the duchess was soon goinging to revamp her online and social media presence.
“I think Meghan is going to have another Instagram,” Meier said on the Royally Obsessed podcast last week. “I think she’s going to do a Goop, like a new version of The Tig … I really think that’s coming.”
The Tig was Markle’s lifestye blog that she ran for close to three years. The website covered things like food, fashion, and travel. However, Markle decided to end her work on the blog in April 2017, and was seen as one of the surest signs that her relationship with Prince Harry was about to progress into an engagement.
Meier added that she had spoken to a close friend of the duchess who not only confirmed the claims about a new lifestyle blog, but also suggested that Markle had already started working on her project.
“I have a friend with a little bit of insider knowledge, and I think she’s already working on something,” Meier claimed.
“I think we will be seeing something very interesting and creative with masterminds from all over the world coming together to bring something inspiring soon,” she finished.
Though Markle technically closed down The Tig, royal fans have noted that she still maintains the domain name and that it is likely the blog could be revived. Currently, the url directs to a page where the duchess wrote a goodbye note to her fans.
Moreover, her passion for the blog was evident in her farewell note on the website.
“What began as a passion project (my little engine that could) evolved into an amazing community of inspiration, support, fun and frivolity,” she wrote before thanking her fans for “everything.”
The duchess has recently been in the news after pledging to continue her lawsuit against The Mail On Sunday.
As was previously reported by The Inquisitr, Markle is currently suing the paper for publishing parts of a “private and confidential” letter she sent to her father shortly after her wedding to Prince Harry. However, the most recent ruling did not fall in her favor, and the presiding judge in her case struck out a number of her arguments.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Meghan Markle is reportedly set to launch her lifestyle website to rival Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop.
Royal insiders have revealed that the Duchess of Sussex is planning to relaunch her The Tig website.
"I think Meghan is going to have another Instagram. I think she's going to do a Goop, like a new version of The Tig . I really think that's coming. I have a friend with a little bit of insider knowledge, and I think she's already working on something," royal expert Myka Meier told the Royally Obsessed podcast.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meghan Markle Reportedy Called ‘Me-Gain’ By Royal Staffers Before Her Departure</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new report from Page Six revealed some of the nicknames Meghan Markle garnered in the Kensington Palace. A palace staffer who spoke with the British author, Tom Quinn, made a few surprising claims about the royal family, including Princess Diana who had a habit of sunbathing without any clothes on.
Reportedly, Diana thought she was safe from being seen by helicopters in the area but apparently she wasn’t. According to the outlet, she was finally informed that helicopters typically come stocked with high-resolution binoculars.
The new book from Tom Quinn then went on to reveal the names for Meghan Markle, including “Me-Gain,” “Di-Lite,” “Di-2,” and the “Duchess of Difficult,” among other terms. It’s not entirely clear why she was given the titles, however, they’re obviously unflattering.
As it was previously reported today, Stanley Johnson speculated on who was the primary decision maker regarding Meghan and Harry’s exit from the royal family at the beginning of the year. Stanley said to reporters that he thought it was probably Meghan, who came to the decision.
According to the father of Boris Johnson, the British Prime Minister, it’s entirely plausible that Meghan was the one “playing a leading role here.” Johnson went on to tell a story of his mother and father, who, after the war, went to live on a quiet farm.
Johnson claimed it may have something to do with the differences between North American and British culture. In other words, Johnson suggested that Meghan yearned for a life in the spotlight, including the paparazzi, and it may have something to do with her North American, and more specifically, Hollywood background.
In other news, sources who spoke with the Royally Obsessed podcast this past week said Meghan was hoping to kick-start her lifestyle blog again, The Tig. Media outlets have compared it to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop, which obviously would be a direct competitor.
As most know, Meghan and Harry’s departure from the royal family caused considerable controversy in the media headlines, including in the UK. Currently, Markle is in a legal battle with the owners of The Daily Mail, Associated Newspaper.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meghan Markle 'to bring back lifestyle blog' to rival Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Meghan Markle has got some big plans now she's stepped down as a senior royal and living her old showbiz life in LA, it's claimed.
The Duchess of Sussex, 38, is said to be bringing back her successful lifestyle blog The Tig in a bid to be the next Gwyneth Paltrow, who runs the similar website Goop.
Meghan shut her blog down in 2017 a year after she started dating Prince Harry, though it's still live with her goodbye message to her followers.
Royal expert Myka Meier has suggested the former Suits actress is working on bringing back a version of The Tig, which covered food, travel, fashion and beauty.
"I think Meghan is going to have another Instagram," Myka told podcast Royally Obsessed last week.
"I think she’s going to do a goop, like a new version of The Tig.
"I really think that’s coming."
Meg could follow in Gwyn's footsteps after the huge success of Goop, which has a similar theme.
Myka added: "I'm pretty sure there's a goopish thing coming soon, for a few different reasons.
"I have a friend with a little bit of insider knowledge and I think she’s already working on something.
"I think we will be seeing something very interesting and creative with masterminds from all over the world coming together to bring something inspiring soon."
Since stepping down as a senior royal Meghan has already narrated Disney Plus documentary Elephants.
Meanwhile, Prince Harry will be introducing the 75th-anniversary episode of Thomas the Tank Engine.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Quebec fashion designer Mathieu Caron launches line of masks inspired by Olympic skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL - A Quebec fashion designer has launched a limited edition of high-end designer masks inspired by the costumes of professional figure skaters he typically dresses.
Mathieu Caron has been designing and manufacturing outfits for several years including the spectacular outfits worn by Canadian Olympic champ Tessa Virtue and world silver medallist Shoma Uno of Japan, among others.
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, that material is being used to create designer masks — with profits going to the World Health Organization.
"We took the same materials as the skaters' costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely recreated the form to make masks," said Caron, a Longueuil, Que.-based skatewear, dancewear, gown and wedding dress designer.
"My primary goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than a ordinary mask."
The unique masks are not for all budgets — with the eight models costing between $150 and $300.
It hasn't stymied interest in the masks. Japanese customers snatched up the items inspired by Uno's costumes, which retailed for $200 to $250.
"I was surprised," Caron admitted. "In times of crisis like this, I honestly didn't think people had so much money to buy a mask."
Caron said at the beginning, the idea was to design a maximum of 15 masks for each skater, but in Japan, they sold 70.
In three hours, 245 masks were sold, giving birth to the hashtag #Shomask in Japan, with stocks of the three models flying off the shelves.
When the items were first made available, a few masks were ready to ship. But given the demand, Caron had to move quickly to fill orders.
The goal wasn't a big marketing campaign, Caron said.
"It was more an artistic contribution to do our part with some members of my team who also got involved in the decoration," Caron said. "But with everything we have sold, we will not be unemployed for the next few weeks."
The fabrics come from the same materials as the skaters' outfits and are very breathable material, with padding included to give them shape and structure.
The masks are made of cotton and polyester fibres.
"Now, is it something medical? Not at all," Caron said. "We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector's item."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Designer Mathieu Caron launches high-end masks inspired by Olympic skaters</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MONTREAL -- Quebec designer Mathieu Caron, whose creations are among the most seen in the world, is launching a line of limited edition, high-end masks inspired by figure skating costumes he designed.
For years, Caron, who hails from Longueuil, has designed spectacular skating costumes seen by millions of viewers, including those of Olympic champion Tessa Virtue and Olympic silver medalist Shoma Uno.
“We took the same materials as the skaters' costumes, the same decorations, the same design, but we completely redid the form to make masks,' said Caron, who also makes dance clothes and other clothing equipment for sports and training.
PROCEEDS GO TO THE WHO
The eight luxury mask models are priced between $150 and $300.
“During this pandemic, my main goal was to make sure that the artistic side could come to help a little, raise funds to make a difference and at the same time make a collection item a little more glamorous than a ordinary mask,” said Caron, noting that all of the proceeds from mask sales will go to the World Health Organization.
Caron reportedly sold over 245 masks in three hours.
The masks especially gained popularity in Japan where the retail price ranges between $200 and $250. 
“I was surprised. I didn't think that in times of crisis like this, people had so much money to buy a mask, honestly,” he said. 
The mask craze quickly led to the hashtag #Showmask. 
ADEQUATE PROTECTION 
Although the mask designs follow health recommendations, Caron insists that they should not be considered medical equipment. 
“It protects very well,” said Caron. “In terms of fabrics, there are cotton and polyester fibers, so it follows the recommendations…. But is this something ‘medical’ ? Not at all. We would rather call it a fashion accessory, a collector's item.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">The year that was: Shari Sebbens brings it all home</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This was Shari Sebbens’ year.
The 35-year-old, best known outside the theatre for the hit movie The Sapphires and roles in TV shows such as The Heights, is Sydney Theatre Company’s current Richard Wherrett fellow. She's also been getting great notices for her work in high-profile productions including Black Is The New White; was about to embark on her directorial debut with STC’s The 7 Stages of Grieving; and had been selected to travel to Los Angeles to take part in a five-day Indigenous talent incubator program.
Then came COVID-19 and for Sebbens – and every other actor in Australia – it all came to a screeching halt.
But in spite of everything, she remains positive and upbeat and – judging by her frequent raucous laughter – has kept her sense of humour.
“I’ve got faith that it’ll all pick up again so I’m sort of enjoying the quiet time,” she says. “It’s weird, but, for an actor, I have a bit of an introverted side so burying myself into a little hole and pretending the rest of the world doesn’t exist is kind of novel for me.”
However, as for the rest of us, virus-enforced lockdown does have its limits.
“I have just started to reach the cabin-fever stage,” she says. “I’ve been stressing my housemates out a bit with my erratic behaviour – trying to entertain myself and entertain them but being more annoying than anything!”
This week would have seen the start of rehearsals for The 7 Stages of Grieving, Wesley Enoch and Deborah Mailman’s ground-breaking 1995 one-woman play.
The STC show has been postponed until “who knows when” but Sebbens is continuing work on the production from home.
“There are a lot of elements of the show that we can still work on,” she says. “We had a great design meeting today. It’s a bit of a blessing, I guess, to have some more time to work on things. It has been really interesting watching the theatre community adapt to new ways of collaborating and working together.”
She’s also continuing work on Superheroes, which she is directing and is due to open with Griffin Theatre Company in November.
“It’s hard to say, but at the moment we are carrying on like it’s going to happen,” she says. “I’m crossing everything and hoping for the best outcome.”
Meantime, along with colleagues including Tim Minchin, Yael Stone and Kate Mulvany, Sebbens is filming short videos from home for a new STC Virtual series.
So far, she has tackled excerpts from Black Is The New White, The 7 Stages Of Grieving, Stolen and, most recently, a hilarious cameo from Blackie Blackie Brown with Ash Flanders.
"It's kind of cool just seeing what we can get away with. We don’t actually have to treat it with the same reverence. We can be a bit more lo-fi and have more fun with it. The pretence is gone because we're sitting in our rooms, looking through a phone screen.”
She’s been getting plenty of positive responses to the whimsical videos, including some less directly focused on her performance.
“I’ve had a lot of comments about my spice rack,” she laughs. “I can’t even take credit for it. It’s actually my housemates’ but they have made me look like a very professional home cook."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The youngest ever winner of 'RuPaul's Drag Race' tells us how drag has gone virtual — and how the disrupted current season's finale should work</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aquaria, the first Gen Z winner of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” is in her house.
For a drag queen, that’s unusual. Many queens derive their primary income from performing at bars and stages all over the world – and from the fans who show up to tip them.
But, like millions around the world, drag queens are sheltering in place during the coronavirus pandemic.
“We’ve really had no other option than to resort to going back to the old days,” Aquaria told Business Insider, “where a lot of us started being little internet queens, and just doing our makeup and honing our craft at home.”
Drag shows around the world have moved online. As Rolling Stone reported, queens have taken to platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and even Instagram Live to keep the party going – and attempt to recoup some lost income.
“I have a lot of privilege and a lot less stress – in theory – when it comes to putting these things together, and getting my [Instagram] Lives and my streams publicized,” Aquaria said.
But she noted that that’s not necessarily the case for local entertainers. Many may have huge followings in their hometowns, but translating that to a global audience – and recouping the tips they would have received from local fans – is a difficult task.
Aquaria, along with a roster of fellow “Drag Race” stars, has been competing in “Werq The World Battle Royale.” It’s a livestream of the self-described “largest drag show on the planet” – and, according to its website, all funds raised go to “displaced local drag entertainers around the globe.” The queens go head to head in runway themes chosen by fans. On May 2, Aquaria will showcase her best interpretation of “Human Touch.”
Battle Royale features one competitor from the current season of “Drag Race” – fan-favourite and frontrunner Gigi Goode. And that reflects a major difference in how season 12’s queens will experience life post-“Drag Race.”
As a season of “Drag Race” airs, queens competing in that season often host viewing parties at gay bars. Fans get to watch the queen offer meta-commentary alongside an episode they compete in, and the queens get a chance to perform in front of excited fans.
“Drag Race” also crowns a winner live; while the finale is prerecorded, every finalist films a segment of them winning. The actual ending is aired in real time, and queens learn their fate alongside the audience – one famous example is a reaction video of Sasha Velour watching herself win season 9.
“Those [viewing parties] were very special moments for me,” Aquaria said. “Getting to share my experiences on ‘Drag Race’ with a group of happy-go-lucky LGBTQ people in a safe space.”
But the queens currently competing on season 12, which began airing weekly on February 28, won’t get any of those experiences because of coronavirus shutdowns.
They also won’t get the post-season visibility – and monetary opportunities – that other competitors have benefited from.
“I was lucky enough to have an unnecessary amount of work while my season was airing and once I’d won,” Aquaria said. “So, that was something that I was extremely grateful for back in the day. And it’s really hard to see that the season 12 girls are not able to really do much as far as work, no matter how hard they want to try.”
But she said that fans have stepped up to try and (virtually) fill that void as much as they can for the current competitors.
“I don’t know if it’s just ’cause I’m online, but I think every day I see so many posts and things shared that are just trying to uplift these girls,” Aquaria said. “Because if they can’t build their fan base and their notoriety on the stage, and in person at the club, we might as well make them internet superstars for the time being.”
And this season – which has already had to contend with the disqualification of contestant Sherry Pie following explosive catfishing allegations – now faces an uncertain finale. Finale episodes are generally recorded a few weeks before airing, which means that, in a non-coronavirus world, a live studio audience would be packing the seats at an LA venue relatively soon.
The show hasn’t made any announcement yet about how the finale will be handled; Aquaria personally believes “some sort of digital version of that would not be acceptable.” She said that potentially delaying the finale – and keeping everyone “on the edge of our seats” – would be a preferable alternative.
“I think the show and the queens and the fans and the world would reap a lot more benefit if we were able to celebrate in the future than if we were supposed to, you know, cheer for 20 minutes sometime next month and then move on from there,” Aquaria said.
For now, drag queens all over the world are still figuring out what their art looks like during this pandemic, from Zoom to Houseparty. But throughout it all, there’s been one constant.
“It’s wild to see people who will grab a cocktail, tune in at 9:00 PM on a Saturday night, and make believe that they’re at a drag show. It’s certainly an extremely surreal time,” Aquaria said. “I know I can definitely speak for any drag entertainer who’s been trying to make do with this to say how challenging it’s been, how interesting it’s been to see how we all adapt and how it is really pushing us to work in a different creative way. And, most importantly, how extremely grateful we all are for the fans who are out there, paying to see these live streams, tipping constantly, and always showing their support.”

The queens go head to head in runway themes chosen by fans. On May 2, Aquaria will showcase her best interpretation of "Human Touch."
Battle Royale features one competitor from the current season of "Drag Race" — fan-favorite and frontrunner Gigi Goode. And that reflects a major difference in how season 12's queens will experience life post-"Drag Race."
As a season of "Drag Race" airs, queens competing in that season often host viewing parties at gay bars. Fans get to watch the queen offer meta-commentary alongside an episode they compete in, and the queens get a chance to perform in front of excited fans.
"Drag Race" also crowns a winner live; while the finale is prerecorded, every finalist films a segment of them winning. The actual ending is aired in real time, and queens learn their fate alongside the audience — one famous example is a reaction video of Sasha Velour watching herself win season 9.
"Those [viewing parties] were very special moments for me," Aquaria said. "Getting to share my experiences on 'Drag Race' with a group of happy-go-lucky LGBTQ people in a safe space."
But the queens currently competing on season 12, which began airing weekly on February 28, won't get any of those experiences because of coronavirus shutdowns.
They also won't get the post-season visibility — and monetary opportunities — that other competitors have benefited from.
"I was lucky enough to have an unnecessary amount of work while my season was airing and once I'd won," Aquaria said. "So, that was something that I was extremely grateful for back in the day. And it's really hard to see that the season 12 girls are not able to really do much as far as work, no matter how hard they want to try."
But she said that fans have stepped up to try and (virtually) fill that void as much as they can for the current competitors.
"I don't know if it's just 'cause I'm online, but I think every day I see so many posts and things shared that are just trying to uplift these girls," Aquaria said. "Because if they can't build their fan base and their notoriety on the stage, and in person at the club, we might as well make them internet superstars for the time being."
And this season — which has already had to contend with the disqualification of contestant Sherry Pie following explosive catfishing allegations —  now faces an uncertain finale. Finale episodes are generally recorded a few weeks before airing, which means that, in a non-coronavirus world, a live studio audience would be packing the seats at an LA venue relatively soon.
The show hasn't made any announcement yet about how the finale will be handled; Aquaria personally believes "some sort of digital version of that would not be acceptable." She said that potentially delaying the finale — and keeping everyone "on the edge of our seats" — would be a preferable alternative.
"I think the show and the queens and the fans and the world would reap a lot more benefit if we were able to celebrate in the future than if we were supposed to, you know, cheer for 20 minutes sometime next month and then move on from there," Aquaria said.
For now, drag queens all over the world are still figuring out what their art looks like during this pandemic, from Zoom to Houseparty. But throughout it all, there's been one constant.
"It's wild to see people who will grab a cocktail, tune in at 9:00 PM on a Saturday night, and make believe that they're at a drag show. It's certainly an extremely surreal time," Aquaria said. "I know I can definitely speak for any drag entertainer who's been trying to make do with this to say how challenging it's been, how interesting it's been to see how we all adapt and how it is really pushing us to work in a different creative way. And, most importantly, how extremely grateful we all are for the fans who are out there, paying to see these live streams, tipping constantly, and always showing their support."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The youngest ever winner of ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race’ tells us how drag has gone virtual — and how the disrupted current season’s finale should work</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aquaria, the first Gen Z winner of “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” is in her house.
For a drag queen, that’s unusual. Many queens derive their primary income from performing at bars and stages all over the world – and from the fans who show up to tip them.
But, like millions around the world, drag queens are sheltering in place during the coronavirus pandemic.
“We’ve really had no other option than to resort to going back to the old days,” Aquaria told Business Insider, “where a lot of us started being little internet queens, and just doing our makeup and honing our craft at home.”
Drag shows around the world have moved online. As Rolling Stone reported, queens have taken to platforms like YouTube, Twitch, and even Instagram Live to keep the party going – and attempt to recoup some lost income.
“I have a lot of privilege and a lot less stress – in theory – when it comes to putting these things together, and getting my [Instagram] Lives and my streams publicized,” Aquaria said.
But she noted that that’s not necessarily the case for local entertainers. Many may have huge followings in their hometowns, but translating that to a global audience – and recouping the tips they would have received from local fans – is a difficult task.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
Vanessa and Stella jumped up and down on a cement divider.
Vanessa Hudgens rocked a skimpy bikini and risked taking a spill to participate in a TikTok challenge. On Sunday, the 31-year-old High School Musical star took to Instagram to share her attempt at the viral splash challenge with her 39.2 million followers. Her younger sister, 24-year-old Players actress Stella Hudgens, performed the somewhat dangerous stunt with her.
The challenge could have ended with the two sisters getting wet, so they both wore bathing suits to give it a shot. Vanessa was rocking an eye-catching string bikini from model Emily Ratajkowski’s swimwear line, Inamorata. Her top was dark blue, and it featured a small polka-dot print. The garment had scanty triangle cups that left little of the actress’ pert cleavage to the imagination.
The top also had halter ties around the neck and extremely long back ties that wrapped around Vanessa’s toned and tan tummy multiple times. She was wearing the strings tied in front so that they trailed down her lean torso.
Vanessa’s bathing suit bottoms were white with dark blue polka dots. They had high-cut leg openings and a low front. The design highlighted her shapely hips and made her slender legs appear slightly longer. Vanessa was also wearing a shiny black bucket hat on her head.
Stella was rocking an off-white bikini that featured a tiny floral print. She was also wearing a black baseball cap. Both sisters appeared to be wet, but they weren’t in the water when their video was filmed. Instead, they were standing on a thin concrete barrier separating a pool from a hot tub. The barefoot siblings were holding hands.
Stella was shown leaping up and kicking both feet behind her, and Vanessa immediately followed her lead. The sisters both laughed hysterically when they managed to land back on the barrier without slipping and falling in the water.
According to The Daily Mail, the object of the splash challenge is to stand near a body of water and to touch both toes on the water’s surface at the same time without falling in. This involves kicking the feet back while keeping them down low and quickly bringing them back forward to land safely on land.
Stella appeared to skim the water with one foot, while Vanessa seemingly didn’t touch it at all. However, the actress’ fans didn’t seem to mind watching her fail. As of this writing, her video has received over 329,000 likes.
“Jiggles on fleek,” read one response to her post.
“Two perfect beautiful goddess thank god,” another fan wrote.
However, a few commenters suggested that what the sisters were doing was dangerous.
“Looks like the break your neck challenge smh,” read a third remark.
Vanessa isn’t the only High School Musical star filming wacky pool videos. On Saturday, Ashley Tisdale uploaded a goofy mini music video costarring her inflatable llama float. For her performance, Ashley wore a pink bikini and mouthed the words to the song “I Want It All.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Just like all other public places, the gyms too are shut during the lockdown leaving fitness enthusiasts stranded. But Priyanka Chopra Jonas seems to have found a rather cute way to keep working those muscles. While not the biggest fan of workouts, Priyanka has figured a way to tone up while at home.
PeeCee shared a video on social media doing some lifts. However, instead of weights, she was lifting up her cute little niece, Krishna Sky Sarkisian. She captioned the video, "No gym, no problem.”
Priyanka is very close to her niece and we keep seeing her adorable videos and pictures that she shares on social media. Well, it looks like the actress has figured out another fun way to spend time with Krishna.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jessica Simpson, 39, looks happier than ever! The blonde beauty took to Instagram while in lockdown with her family to share a snap of herself and one-year-old daughter Birdie enjoying their time in the sun. Jess posted the black and white snap on May 2, with the caption, “I think I now have that kid Saturday happy kind of feeling all over again! No school for 2 whole days!!! #BIRDIEMAE.” The Dukes of Hazard star rocked a bikini top and oversized sunglasses, as she pulled her hair into a high ponytail.
Fans were quick to comment on how incredible Jess looked in the snap, in which she wore a massive smile on her face. “You look amazing,” one fan wrote, while another commented, “Beautiful baby and mommy.” It comes just days after the Open Book author shared a pic on Instagram that showed her lounging in an infinity pool while in self isolation. In the snap she wore a tiny bikini that showed off her enviable figure.
“Attempted gettin’ some sun and my son smacked a home run from the driveway that almost nailed me in the face. Proof is in the splash. Needless to say, I got off the mat,” the mother of three wrote, adding a laughing emoji. Her fans loved how relatable the moment was. You know, aside from the relaxing in a luxurious pool part. Most of the United States has been under some form of quarantine during the coronavirus crisis, and kids being home full-time from school definitely has its difficulties. It’s important to have some alone time every once in awhile!
The fashion designer isn’t sweating any of the small stuff right now. After ex-boyfriend John Mayer talked about her memoir (which says some less than flattering things about him) on Watch What Happens Live, a source told HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY that she, frankly, doesn’t care. “That’s so in the past for her and she’s very happy with the life she leads now,” they said. “Of course, she knew that he would maybe read it or at the very least hear about it, but she told her side of the story and truth and that’s what this book was about to her.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1, 2020
Kathryn Cook
Bru Luccas took to Instagram to share a smoking-hot photo while clad in a bikini top and Daisy Dukes. The sexy update hit her feed on Friday afternoon, and her fans have been raving about it ever since.
The photo captured the model hanging out in Foster City, California. She sat on a white towel with blue stripes in a large patch of grass with a sparkling blue body of water at her back. Bru turned her head slightly and gazed into the camera with a sultry stare.
She held a tiny metal bottle in her hand, and her caption told fans that she was staying hydrated with a Purple Tree product. She ensured that all eyes were on her bombshell body in a skimpy outfit.
Bru stunned in a black halter-style bikini top with thin shoulder straps and a low-cut neckline that left her decolletage completely bare. It boasted small cups with ruching around the edges, which hardly contained her cleavage. The cups connected in the middle with two thin strings, leaving even more of her chest on display for the camera, though her fans certainly didn’t seem to mind. The sexy piece also allowed for her muscular arms to be put on display.
Her lower half looked just as hot with a pair of tiny Daisy Dukes that sat just below her navel. The dark denim shorts accentuated her small waist and taut tummy, while their high cut showcased her fit stems in their entirety.
She opted to go jewelry-free for the occasion, and rocked a light pink polish on her nails. Bru wore her long brunette locks in a sweeping style, and they cascaded down to her hip. She opted for a natural application of makeup, which included eyeliner, mascara, and a nude lip.
The photo has earned the model plenty of attention from her army of fans with over 52,000 likes and over 200 comments in only a few hours. Some followers commented on the product that she was promoting, while many others raved over her gym-honed figure.
A few others were left speechless and chimed in with flame, heart, and star emoji instead of words. Comments for the Brazilian babe were left in a mix of Portuguese and English.
“Very very attractive and beautiful figure,” one fan commented with a series of kissy face emoji.
“What a beauty,” a second social media user complimented with a single flame in the caption.
“Right next to my house! You look amazing,” another fan pointed out.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jesy Nelson dons a beard for clip and fans reckon she still looks hot with bristles</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Little Mix star Jesy Nelson has proved she still looks hot even when she's sporting a BEARD.
Jesy transformed herself into an electrician named Gary and wore fake facial hear for funny sketch which she shared on Instagram to her 6.7m fans.
The singer, 28, lay on her bed wearing a skimpy crop top and silk pyjama bottoms, alongside her pal Charlotte who was posing as a plumber named Steve.
And the stunner's Insta fans were very impressed with her new look - with many rushing to the comments section to tell her she looked 'hot'.
One wrote: "Still Gorgeous @jesynelson."
Another gushed: "Still would."
A third added: "Now i love you more."
Many of Jesy's followers also praised her for posting the clip and said it had them 'cracking up'.
The pair told how they were called 'Sparky Boiz' while bigging up their handyman services.
Jesy said: "What's Going on everyone, Gary here, just thought I'd do a quick post cos me and my mate Steve are still working in lockdaaan."
Jesy has been keeping her fans entertained Instagram posts during lockdown.
Earlier this week she posted a snap of her in a very scanty outfit as she headed to Sainsbury's.
Her jeans were unzipped when she made her journey to the supermarket giant amid the coronavirus outbreak.
Quickly stopping for a photoshoot before her shop, Jesy worked all her best angles for the camera flash.
The newly-single Little Mix star, 28, donned a skimpy handkerchief top with her ripped jeans as she posed up outside her plush front door.
Jesy Nelson sent a clear message to her ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes after their split earlier this month.
The singer, 28, filmed herself dancing around her plush kitchen last week to her band Little Mix's new track Break Up Song in a vido she posted to Instagram.
She passionately sang the lyrics "This is not a second chance, no, no, baby/This is not a new romance, not tonight/This is for all the nights I cried for you, baby."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Telford woman wears new fancy dress costume every day to keep spirits high</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Telford woman has been passing the time during the lockdown finding a new eccentric costume to wear everyday, posting photos online daily to keep her friends' spirits high.
Gemma Aston, 36, from Woodside, has been dressing up with different themes for over a month, with some of her favourites including glamorous film star Audrey Hepburn and Olivia Newton-John's 'Grease' character, Sandy.
She posts the results to her Facebook profile to spark some smiles.
Gemma, a volunteer support worker, has collected costumes herself over the years and has also had support from friends and family.
"I have had ideas, friends and neighbours have dropped stuff off as well.
"Hopefully I can keep going for a little while longer but I am struggling, running out of ideas.
"The idea was from my friend, she used to work with me. Everyone knows I love to dress up – at Christmas for the week I dressed up every day in all of my Christmas costumes."
Her friend challenged her to find a new costume for every day during lockdown.
"It has been quite fun and I have had some lovely comments from people saying 'I'm in hospital, I have seen your posts, it is keeping me going'."
One of the costumes served as a special tribute to a friend's husband, who died of cancer two weeks ago.
Gemma wore Paul Simpson's beloved Birmingham City FC shirt, lent to her by Paul's partner Lisa, for one of her photo shoots and raised money for Cancer Research UK.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King's Joe Exotic becomes the face of a new fashion line from prison</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tiger King 's Joe Exotic has become the face of a new streetwear collection that features printed images of backstabbing, betrayal and fake friends.
The infamous tiger handler, 57, who is currently serving a 22-year jail sentence, is believed to have hammered out the business details from his jail cell.
According to TMZ, fashion label owner Odain Watson asked Joe to partner with him on a limited collection for the brand Odaingerous.
A contract is "close to being signed" as the two parties agree on the final financial terms.
Odain appears to have confirmed the news on the brand's social media page.
The clothing range, dubbed the 'Revenge' collection, will feature prints of Joe's face as well as references from the Netflix mega-hit series.
One of the staple pieces from the collection is believed to be a print t-shirt that features a leather jacket decorated with tiger stripes.
Joe Exotic and the staff of GW Zoo in Oklahoma were propelled into the spotlight when Netflix released the bizarre Tiger King docuseries on March 20.
According to the streaming giant, over 64 million homes worldwide have tuned in to watch the shocking documentary series.
Full of twists and unusual turns, the documentary details the bitter feud between Joe and his his arch-nemesis Carole Baskin, and also sheds light on the United State's harrowing big cat trade.
The tiger handler - whose real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage - was eventually sentenced to 22 years in federal prison for a murder for hire plot, falsifying records and a number of animal abuse violations.
Joe has also developed somewhat of a unusual cult following after the series was aired.
Among other products that are now available, fans can buy Joe Exotic condoms and even animal print bikinis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tiger King's Joe Exotic 'becomes new face of fashion brand' while in jail</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tiger King star Joe Exotic has reportedly become the face of a new fashion collection based on the Netflix docuseries.
The 57-year-old, who is currently serving a 22-year prison sentence for charges including murder-for-hire and animal abuse, is believed to have teamed up with fashion label owner Odain Watson from his jail cell.
TMZ has reported that Odain had asked Joe to partner with him for a limited clothing range for the fashion brand Odaingerous, and a contract is allegedly ‘closed to being signed’ as the two agree on the final financial terms.
The fashion range, which will be called the Revenge collection, includes prints of Joe’s face alongside many Tiger King references.
A t-shirt that features a leather jacket decorated with tiger stripes is set to be one of the many pieces that will be available to be purchased.
Odain appears to have already confirmed the news, as he shared pictures of some of the t-shirts on the Odaingerous Instagram page.
‘Don’t Get Mad Get Even,’ he wrote. ‘@odaingerous presents the #Revenge starring @joe_exotic #joeexotic from @netflix #tigerking coming soon.’
It comes after the UK-based online fashion retailers Missguided and In The Style launched their own Tiger King themed t-shirts.
If that wasn’t enough, there’s also plenty of other merchandise based on the series available to buy, including animal print bikinis and even condoms.
In other news, Kevin Bacon revealed that he would love to play Joe Exotic in a film about the former zoo owner.
Following on from the success of the series, there has been talk of bringing it to the big screen – and Kevin happens to be the bookmakers’ favourite to portray Joe.
During an appearance on the Today show in the US, he said: ‘I’d play Joe Exotic in a second.’
He later added that he had first throught about playing the role after his wife, Kyra Sedgwick, had asked him while he was watching the documentary.
He recalled telling her: ‘This is an amazing show. I said, “The reason that I’m watching the show is because these are the kind of characters I get asked to play.”
‘This is my type of guy, you know, so listen, fingers crossed!’

    <h5 class="mb-1">St. Jude music therapists organize backyard jams for kids</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Amy Love had to leave the Memphis hospital where she brings music to severely ill children — she and other support staff couldn’t take the risk of spreading COVID-19 to these frail patients.
But she was determined: The music must not stop.
So her house became a recording studio, and Love, fellow music therapist Celeste Douglas and intern Abigail Parrish became video stars for kids at St. Jude’s Children’s Research Hospital who feed on their energy, their melodies, their love.
“Let’s get moving!” Love cries, as she sits cross-legged on a blanket in her backyard.
They play guitars and little drums, shakers and tambourines, and Love’s dog joins in on the fun — even as a lawn-mowing neighbor seems a bit puzzled.
“We’re really excited to be with you today, even if we can’t be there in person,” Douglas tells their early childhood group from afar.
No instruments? No problem. Love urges their viewers: “Just move around with us!”
The familiar tunes they choose to help the kids with fine and gross motor skills, body awareness and other trouble areas they’d usually take on in the hospital include “If You’re Happy and You Know It” and “Old MacDonald Had a Farm.”
For older patients, Love left behind some ukuleles with easy instructions and song selections from Twenty One Pilots and Selena Gomez.
Entertainer Danny Thomas opened the pediatric treatment and research hospital for children with catastrophic diseases in 1962. Care is free for all. Since many of the patients are immune deficient, Love and other support staff are working remotely.
The hospital’s two resident therapy dogs are on hiatus off campus, as well.
“What we’re doing is finding new ways to support our kiddos and keep them safe at the same time,” Love said.
In the hospital, the team holds the early childhood music group once a week for kids up to 3 years old.
“That’s one thing I’ve really missed,” Love said. “We’d all get together and play tons of music and were super loud.”
Switching gears was a bit of a learning curve, she said. Like the ukuleles. Asking kids to teach themselves the instrument could have gone either way, but Love was optimistic.
“It’s a really easy instrument to feel really successful with,” she said. “You can mark up different parts of the ukulele and play it pretty easy. Even with one finger you can be successful and play a chord.”
Love can’t wait for the day she can return to the hospital. In the meantime, she has a mission.
“Music is not canceled,” she said. “We’re going to continue playing music until we can all get back together again.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">WATCH: Wolverhampton NHS worker Holly lifting spirits through song</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Thomas, aged 18, started an apprenticeship for the NHS in September as a clinical support worker, she is now working on an coronavirus isolation ward at Russell's Hall Hospital in Dudley.
The youngster from Woodcross, Wolverhampton, is an aspiring nurse who has had a passion for music since she was a child.
Emma Connor Thomas, her mum aged 43, said: "Holly has always been passionate about singing and music but has never had the confidence to perform in front of people, even though she has a beautiful voice."
Emma recorded her daughter singing Vera Lynn's The White Cliffs of Dover and posted it to her Facebook page hoping to spread a message of hope to her friends, since then it has been viewed by thousands of people across the country.
Holly said "I know how upsetting and stressful it is for front line workers, caring for the most sick and vulnerable people at this time, but I've always found that music can really lift people's spirits.
"I chose the song White Cliffs of Dover because the words in it are relatable to us all at the moment and the song gives us hope that this will all be over soon.
"I hoped that my video would bring a smile and hope to every one, not just key workers but also people at home.
"I only expected close family and friends to see my video but the reaction has been amazing. The video has had 15,000 views already and I'm overwhelmed by everyone's lovely comments.
"It was nice going into work the next day to find my colleagues had watched my video and said how much they enjoyed watching it and it had put them in a better mood."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Disha Patani To Make A Special Appearance In Allu Arjun’s Pushpa? Deets Inside</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Allu Arjun’s upcoming action-thriller Pushpa is one of the most awaited films of the year. Ever since the first look of the film has been unveiled, fans are excited to watch the film. Apart from all the news and hype around the film, we hear that Bollywood babe Disha Patani has also been roped in for the film.
If media reports are to be believed, Disha Patani has been roped in for a special dance number in Pushpa. The actress will be seen grooving with Allu Arjun in the peppy dance number. Reports elaborate that Disha Patani has been approached by the makers for a song, but she has not yet given the nod.
For the unversed, Disha Patani had earlier taken to Instagram and lauded the South actor for his terrific dance moves. And well, if the media reports are true, then it’ll be a delight to see the two in one frame.
However, while the rumour about Disha Patani being a part of Pushpa is going strong, there is no official confirmation on the said news. Talking about the film, it stars Allu Arjun opposite the ever-gorgeous Rashmika Mandanna. Helmed by Sukumar, the movie is co-produced by Y. Naveen whereas the music for the same has been composed by Devi Sri Prasad.
Coming back to Disha Patani, the actress who made her debut in films with Telugu film Loafer opposite Varun Tej, rose to fame with M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story. The actress was last seen in Mohit Suri’s Malang opposite Aditya Roy Kapoor.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Disha Patani To Flaunt Her Killer Moves In An Item Song For Allu Arjun’s Pushpa?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Disha Patani is all set to make a comeback in Tollywood. Yes, you heard it right! The Bollywood diva, who made her debut with 2015 Telugu film Loafer, is gearing up to raise the temperature with her killer moves. As per rumours Disha, who is currently busy with her Bollywood projects, will also be a part of Allu Arjun's Pushpa. She will be sharing screen space with the Stylish Star for an item number in the action-thriller. If the rumour has anything to go by, the movie will mark her re-entry after five years of Puri Jagannadh's directorial, Loafer.
On a related note, Pushpa will have South diva Rashmika Mandanna essaying the female lead. There were also rumours suggesting that Allu Arjun and Rashmika Mandanna will not be romantically paired in the film, which disappointed many fans. The makers rubbished the rumour saying that there is no second actress in the highly anticipated thriller. There is also buzz that Bollywood star Suniel Shetty will be essaying the antagonist in the film. Well, an official confirmation about the cast is awaited from the makers' side. Earlier, Vijay Sethupathi had walked out of the project citing creative difference with the team. He has been replaced with Kannada actor Dhananjay to reprise the role.
The first look poster, unveiled on Allu Arjun's birthday, showed a rough and tough rugged look of the actor, which stirred the excitement of his fans. Adding to the thrill, it is rumoured that he will be sporting a stylish avatar of a don in the action-thriller for a flashback sequence. Pushpa bankrolled by Mythri Movie Makers, will arrive in the theatres next year. However, the release date is yet to be confirmed.
Coming back to Disha Patani, the actress will next be seen in KTina directed by Ashima Chibber and Prabhu Deva's Radhe alongside Salman Khan. Radhe's release has been reportedly postponed from Eid to an indefinite date due to the ongoing pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Allu Arjun Getting a Match from Bollywood?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Allu Arjun’s unequivocal dancing skills have been the talk of the film industry recently when superstar Hrithik Roshan, the Greek God of Bollywood who is a terrific dancer himself said that Allu Arjun’s dance is inspiring and energetic.
Presently, as reported by some media articles, Bollywood actress, the hottest Instagram sensation, Disha Patani might shake a leg with the stylish star in his upcoming movie ‘Pushpa‘ with director Sukumar.
Disha Patani is not just famous for her hottest body but also for her dancing skills. She has a flexible body and every dance movement sinks in effortlessly. No doubt, she would make a terrific dance partner for Allu Arjun.
But, let’s not make haste and therefore, let’s wait for the official confirmation on the same. However, we are going to keep our fingers crossed hoping that Allu Arjun indeed gets his match (dancing) from Bollywood.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Madonna tests positive for coronavirus antibodies and 'wants to breathe COVID-19 air'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Madonna has revealed that she tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies in her latest 'Quarantine Diary'.
Following her results, the 61-year-old singer hoped to take a long drive over the weekend and wanted to 'breathe in the COVID-19 air'.
The presence of antibodies means that a person is likely to have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus in the past.
The legendary musician's latest revelation came in the form of a moody black and white video that she shared on her social media page.
In the two-minute long edited clip, Madonna sat behind a typewriter for the 14th installment of her quarantine memoirs.
As she tapped on the type writer in front of her, Madonna read out her diary news and calmly revealed to fans that she possessed antibodies against the virus.
“Took a test the other day, and I found out that I have the antibodies,” she said.
“So tomorrow, I’m just going to go for a long drive in the car… and I’m going to breathe in the COVID-19 air. Yep. I hope the sun is shining.”
Throughout the video she also made a number of other remarks regarding COVID-19 as she mused over the deadly virus.
In one line she said: "I have been in quarantine because I know the futility of it."
Later, Madonna shared different thoughts: “It amazes me that we care so much about what people think or winning people’s favor or being right in an argument.”
Ever since the start of the pandemic, Madonna has been documenting her lockdown with a series of unusual diary videos on her social media.
In an earlier post from the start of April, the singer tragically revealed that three people close to her all passed away within the space of 24 hours.
The Material Girl was also forced to cancel her Madame X in Paris tour because of the deadly virus.
The Queen of Pop has been holed up at home with her toyboy lover Ahlamalik Williams, 26, as well as her children, twins Estere and Stella, seven, Mercy James, 13, David Banda, 14 and Rocco, 19.
According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), officials are unsure whether possessing the coronavirus antibodies make a person immune to future infection.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Singer Madonna says she plans to “breathe in the COVID-19 air” after testing positive for antibodies.
The 61year-old took to Instagram on Thursday to post a video that she called Quarantine Diaries No. 14, reports people.com.
“I took a test the other day, and I found out that I have the antibodies,” Madonna said in the clip, in which she uses a typewriter.
She added that she plans to spend some time out of her house.
“So tomorrow I’m just going to go for a long drive in the car, I’m going to roll down the window and I’m going to breathe in the COVID-19 air. Yup. I hope the sun is shining,” she said in the video.
She concluded by saying: “Here’s the good news: tomorrow’s another day and I’m going to wake up and I’m going to feel differently.”
Madonna also shared a few photos on her Instagram Story, with “#staysafe” and “#staysane” written on them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Madonna tests positive for coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pop diva Madonna has revealed that she has tested positive for the COVID-19 anitbodies.
The singer shared the news in the 14th edition of her “Quarantine Diary” on Instagram TV.
“Took a test the other day and I found out that I have the antibodies. So tomorrow I’m just going to go for a long drive in the car, and I’m gonna roll down the window and I’m gonna breathe in the COVID-19 air. Yup. I hope the sun is shining,” Madonna said.
According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), US, antibody tests are used to determine whether or not a person has been exposed to COVID-19 by finding proteins the body produces to fight the virus. However, the CDC has yet to confirm if the possession of antibodies is equal to immunity.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Madison Lennon
Cosplay model Liz Katz gave her fans the perfect way to start their weekend by uploading a sexy double-photo post to her Instagram page first thing on Saturday morning.
Liz wore a tan v-neck top and form-fitting charcoal pants. She accessorized with a plain white visor, joking that even if her future isn’t “bright enough for shades,” she still wants to protect herself from the sun’s UV rays.
Rather than posting a slideshow, the model combined her two pics into a single split-screen image. She posed the same way in each still. Liz bent over at the waist with one hand on her inner thigh and the other tugging on her shirt to deepen her already plunging cleavage.
In the left snapshot, Liz leaned her head back and smiled softly. For the right pic, she faced the camera head-on and widened her eyes.
To complete her overall look, she pulled her short blond hair into a messy ponytail, tugging it through the visor, so it spilled over the side, brushing her shoulder.
She used a light layer of makeup to accentuate her natural beauty and plump lips. By filling in her lips with pink lipstick, Liz managed to make her mouth look soft and kissable. It appeared she used a little blush and foundation to add color to her cheeks, nose, and forehead.
As a final touch, she added a smoothing filter to her photos. She left her black-and-white arm tattoo exposed in both images.
She snapped the pictures of herself while standing in her hallway near a doorframe. A vacuum cleaner is visible behind her.
Within 30 minutes of updating her Instagram with the sultry pics, Liz’s post amassed over 5,200 likes. Once her followers realized she had updated her feed, they quickly flooded her comments section to compliment her appearance and praise her curvy figure.
“As always incredibly beautiful,” gushed one fan, trailing their comment with two black hearts and a flame emoji.
“That’s such a sexy look,” praised another admirer, emphasizing their point with two flame emoji.
“Absolutely gorgeous Liz stunning……my perfect woman…….ti amo,” wrote a third social media user, inserting two red heart emoji to their compliment.
“Enchanting and stunning reflection,” chimed in a fourth commenter.
On Friday, Liz gave her fans a peek at her blossoming baby bump while wearing an open black robe. Her outfit showcased her ample bosom, too. Fans went crazy over the post, and it racked up more than 110,000 likes.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Va va voom! Sofia Richie, 22, left little to the imagination when she and a gorgeous galpal were spotted walking together on the beach on Friday, May 1, with boyfriend Scott Disick, 35, riding behind them. The social media superstar looked to be having an absolute blast as she was photographed with a big smile on her face while chatting it up with her friend. She stunned in just a snakeskin bikini and sunglasses that put her enviable figure in display as they got a good tan during the sunny outing. Scott, meanwhile, tore up the sand with his motorbike while dressing in his usual cool, calm and collected kind of style in a tan t-shirt, black shorts and sneakers.
The beach is a place that Sofia and Scott have been seen at several times over the past couple of weeks as they’ve been escaping their days in quarantine. Sofia has been serving summer realness with her array of bikini options that she’s sizzled in each time they have been spotted out and about. She appears to have worn that same snakeskin bikini on Thursday, April 23, with Scott and their pal. The Flip It Like Disick star dressed a tad more debonair this time around compared to what he was sporting on Friday as he wore a Frescobol Carioca’s linen Antonio Shirt and green striped shorts.
The cuteness factor went into overdrive when Scott’s son Reign, 5, (who he shares with ex-girlfriend Kourtney Kardashian, 41), joined him, Sofia and their dog Hershela at the beach on Saturday, April 25. A romantic moment happened during their time there where she was seen holding her man tightly as they rode through the beach on his motorbike.
Sofia did a little photoshoot during one of her days at the beach when she posted a pic on her Instagram of her pretending to ride Scott’s bike in just an orange bikini, flip flops and protective face gear. “So what are we calling summer 2020?”, she captioned the snap.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Madison Lennon
American model Jailyne Ojeda Ochoa captivated her 11.6 million Instagram followers on Friday afternoon with a provocative pic of herself wearing red lingerie while at the beach.
In the pic, Jailyne dropped down on all fours and popped her voluptuous booty while looking at the camera. She wore lacy red lingerie, including cheeky panties that accentuated her curvy derrière and an underwire bra that supported her sizeable chest. Aside from her rear end, Jailyne also exposed her shapely shoulders, slender legs, and thick thighs.
She went barefoot for the photoshoot, digging her toes into the sand behind her while her palms lay flat beneath her. To pose for the snap, she looked serene while gazing into the camera and arched her back to make her rear stand out.
Jailyne left her long raven-colored locks loose, they flowed in the breeze coming off the ocean behind her. She rocked a full face of makeup, including a bright pink lip and dramatic eye makeup. She used a mixture of eyeshadow, eyeliner, and mascara to make her eyes look especially glamorous and finished her look by sculpting her brows.
She did not specify who took the picture or the location where she was photographed.
In her caption, Jailyne said she looked like a mermaid and used a matching emoji to go along with her statement. The remainder of her paragraph joked about her trying to bury her “flying toe” to keep it hidden from view.
She also advertised a new YouTube video recently posted to her channel and asked her fans to follow the link in her bio to subscribe and view it. She used a few other emoji in her caption, including two red hearts, praise-hands, and a smiley face.
Her post racked up over 220,500 likes and more than 1,700 comments from her loyal fan base.
“Thank you for sharing yourself with everyone on YouTube. Great content and very great to see who you really are. Thank you again!!!” raved one fan.
“That arch tho,” gushed another admirer, inserting a peach, drooling, and flame emoji to their comment.
“We all know you are not a mermaid, you are a Goddess,” wrote a third person.
“U would be the prettiest mermaid in the ocean,” chimed in a fourth user, adding four praise-hands emoji to their remark.
The model loves to flaunt her curvy figure regularly on her Instagram page. In April, she shared a few videos on her page that showcased her enviable body, including her cleavage and her behind.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jake Gyllenhaal whispered to his rising homemade bread, and people are raving about the actor's sourdough starter expertise</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jake Gyllenhaal and host Stephen Colbert recently bonded over their newfound affinity for making bread from scratch.
It’s no wonder that the actor and late-night TV show host have taken to making their own bread, as it’s recently become a popular pastime. Some people are turning loaves into edible works of art, while others have gotten creative by trying bread recipes that don’t require a sourdough starter.
In an episode of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” that was released on Wednesday, Gyllenhaal talked about how he got his start with the art of homemade bread-making, and he appeared to whisper to his rising loaf of bread.
“I’ve found myself falling in love with sourdough,” Gyllenhaal told Colbert. “I have a good friend who’s a baker in San Francisco . . . we were talking, and I hate this, but I was like, ‘Can you teach me how to do a sourdough starter?’ And off I went.”
Colbert then showed Gyllenhaal his container of sourdough bread starter, which was in a plastic container.
He asked Gyllenhaal for baking advice: “Now what do I do?”
Gyllenhaal responded by lifting a rising loaf of homemade bread to the camera.
“To go from that, to this, which is resting. It’s not yet fully rising, but it’s on its way,” Gyllenhaal said in a whisper.
“What I do with it, is I take the starter, and then you have to get a nicer wheat flour,” Gyllenhaal told Colbert. “You make what they call, in America, a pre-ferment. You let that rest for 12 to 24 hours, and then, you can start mixing it up into some other flour, and then make your dough.”
Gyllenhaal’s soothing yet serious way of tending to his rising sourdough – and the nearly five minutes of the episode he spent talking about bread – seemed to capture the hearts of fans and viewers of the show.
Gyllenhaal also spoke to Colbert about his performance in a musical tribute to Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim, as well as his attempt at the T-Shirt handstand challenge after being tagged by his “Spider-Man: Far From Home” costar Tom Holland.

“I’ve found myself falling in love with sourdough,” Gyllenhaal told Colbert. “I have a good friend who’s a baker in San Francisco . . . we were talking, and I hate this, but I was like, ‘Can you teach me how to do a sourdough starter?’ And off I went.”
Colbert then showed Gyllenhaal his container of sourdough bread starter, which was in a plastic container.
He asked Gyllenhaal for baking advice: “Now what do I do?”
Gyllenhaal responded by lifting a rising loaf of homemade bread to the camera.
“To go from that, to this, which is resting. It’s not yet fully rising, but it’s on its way,” Gyllenhaal said in a whisper.
“What I do with it, is I take the starter, and then you have to get a nicer wheat flour,” Gyllenhaal told Colbert. “You make what they call, in America, a pre-ferment. You let that rest for 12 to 24 hours, and then, you can start mixing it up into some other flour, and then make your dough.”
Gyllenhaal’s soothing yet serious way of tending to his rising sourdough – and the nearly five minutes of the episode he spent talking about bread – seemed to capture the hearts of fans and viewers of the show.
Gyllenhaal also spoke to Colbert about his performance in a musical tribute to Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim, as well as his attempt at the T-Shirt handstand challenge after being tagged by his “Spider-Man: Far From Home” costar Tom Holland.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte is often compared to a young Prince William, but fans are saying she looks just like one of her distant relatives</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princess Charlotte turned 5 years old on Saturday, and with her birthday came a new round of royal photographs taken by Kate Middleton herself.
In the photos that were released to mark her birthday, Princess Charlotte is shown helping her family deliver packages of meals to people in need. The young royal also posed for a formal portrait, which was also taken by the Duchess of Cambridge.
Photos of Princess Charlotte, the middle child and only daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are often compared to pictures of Prince William from when he was around the same age.
Prince William once even confused a childhood photo of himself for a picture of his daughter.
However, Princess Charlotte’s latest birthday portraits have brought to light another royal lookalike – one of her older cousins, Lady Sarah Chatto.
Lady Sarah Chatto is the only daughter of the late Princess Margaret, the Queen’s sister. This makes Lady Sarah Chatto a niece of the Queen, and a second cousin of Princess Charlotte.
Above, a photo from around 1969 shows a young Lady Sarah Chatto (then Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones) with her brother, Viscount Linley.
Princess Charlotte looked especially similar to her cousin when she wore a similar green coat and even, ironically, had her hair styled in a similar fashion during the family’s Christmas celebrations in 2019.
Other photos of young Lady Sarah Chatto resemble Princess Charlotte’s signature cheeky facial expressions and bashful waves.
Another interesting detail about the two distant cousins is that Lady Sarah Chatto’s birthday is May 1, and Princess Charlotte’s birthday is May 2. The cousins are some 51 years apart in age, but photos of the two taken around the same time of their lives have some pretty uncanny similarities.
In addition to Lady Sarah Chatto and Prince William, pictures of Princess Charlotte have also been compared to childhood photos of her great-grandma Queen Elizabeth II, Princess Diana, and Lady Kitty Spencer, the niece of Princess Diana.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Royals celebrate Princess Charlotte's 5th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON - The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have released new photographs to celebrate their daughter Princess Charlotte's 5th birthday.
The couple's middle child turned five on Saturday and they posted four new pictures to their Twitter account the day before and added a fifth picture on her birthday.
They wrote: "The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday tomorrow.
"The images were taken by The Duchess as the family helped to pack up and deliver food packages for isolated pensioners in the local area."
A message on the couple's Kensington Palace Twitter account on Saturday added: "Thank you for all your lovely messages on Princess Charlotte's fifth birthday!
"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share a new photograph of Princess Charlotte, taken by The Duchess this April."
All of the pictures were taken by keen amateur photographer Catherine and four of them showed Charlotte helping to pack homemade pasta and deliver food parcels to isolated pensioners near the family's home Anmer Hall, in Norfolk.
The entire family, including Prince William, 37, Duchess Catherine, 38, and their sons Prince George, six and Prince Louis, two, helped Charlotte deliver the food parcels, as part of an initiative started by Queen Elizabeth's staff at her Sandringham estate.
They spent two and a half hours driving around to deliver food and one delighted resident told the Daily Mail newspaper: "They got drenched as it was pouring with the rain but I think they just wanted to do their bit."
Meanwhile, Prince Charles and Duchess Camilla wished the youngster a happy birthday via Twitter, sharing one of Catherine's pictures and writing: "Wishing Princess Charlotte a very Happy Birthday."
And a message on the official Royal Family's account read: "A very Happy Birthday to Princess Charlotte who is celebrating her 5th birthday today. Princess Charlotte is The Queen's fifth great-grandchild.
"To mark the day @KensingtonRoyal have released new photos of Princess Charlotte taken by The Duchess of Cambridge."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte Has a Surprise Royal Twin</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Today is Princess Charlotte's fifth birthday, which means she joins the ranks of those of us who have to celebrate in quarantine. But her parents seem to be doing their best to give her a great birthday. On Friday, they posted four new photos that Kate Middleton took of the little royal to mark her special day. Royal fans who saw the images noticed one thing in particular: Charlotte has a royal twin.
Per Hello! magazine, the princess bears a resemblance to Lady Sarah Chatto, the only daughter of Princess Margaret, Queen Elizabeth's sister. Charlotte has also been compared to her great-grandmother the Queen; People magazine compared their childhood photos on the occasion of Charlotte's birthday, and the resemblance is definitely clear.
It makes sense that others would think she looks like Elizabeth's niece Sarah. When you look at Elizabeth, Margaret, and Sarah, it's very obvious that they're all related. It looks like Charlotte is taking after the Windsor side! Here's another photo of her that her parents added today:
One of the photos Kate took shows Princess Charlotte delivering food to people who are self-isolating in the global pandemic. In the photo, you can see a reflection of Kate and William in the door on which Charlotte is knocking.
Besides doing good deeds for others in quarantine, Charlotte and her brothers appear to have been having a lot of fun at home with their parents.
"Children have got such stamina," Kate said in a BBC interview last month. "I don't know how, honestly. You get to the end of the day and you write a list of all the things you've done in that day. You've pitched a tent, take the tent down again, cook, bake, you get to the end of the day. They've had a lovely time. It's amazing how much you can cram into one day, that's for sure."
Let's hope Charlotte has a birthday full of tens, cooking, baking, and lots of birthday hugs from her family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New photos released for Princess Charlotte's 5th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2 (UPI) -- Britain's Kensington Palace released four new photos of Princess Charlotte in honor of her fifth birthday Saturday.
"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday tomorrow. The images were taken by The Duchess as the family helped to pack up and deliver food packages for isolated pensioners in the local area," the palace captioned Friday's snapshots, which show the tiny royal wearing a black-and-white houndstooth coat-dress.
Charlotte is the middle child of Prince William and his wife, Kate Middleton.
The couple, who celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary Wednesday, are also parents to Prince George, 6, and Prince Louis, 2.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Thanks to royal family photographer Samir Hussein, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle may have a new favorite photo.
In a new interview with Us Weekly, Hussein shares that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were "really happy" with the now-iconic snapshot the photographer captured of the royal couple back in March. The photo in question was from the 2020 Endeavour Fund Awards in London—one of the last public appearances from the couple as active working royals— where Hussein captured the pair beaming at each other whilst under an umbrella as they arrived to the event.
"The picture that I took of Harry and Meghan in the rain recently, I’ve never had a reaction to a picture like that one. In terms of the reaction I’ve had from people, that’s got to be the most iconic from that point of view," Hussein told Us Weekly. "I spoke to some of their team and they were really happy about it and talking about it."
The photographer—who had spent time photographing the couple all around the world over the past few years, including locations such as Australia, Fiji and Africa—expressed how he'll miss being able to capture images of the pair due to their recent relocation to Los Angeles this spring.
"I’m really disappointed that I won’t get to photograph them so much anymore," admitted Hussein. "I hope to get to photograph them [again]."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Happy 5th Birthday, Princess Charlotte: See The Royal’s Cutest Photos Of All-Time</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prince William and Kate Middleton’s middle child, Princess Charlotte, turns five years old on May 2, and of course, we have to celebrate! It’s hard to believe that it’s been FIVE years since the royals brought their little bundle of joy home from the hospital, and Charlotte has been growing up right before our eyes. In pictures and videos, she’s proven to be quite sassy and outgoing, and there’s no denying that she’s absolutely adorable. We’ve rounded up some of Charlotte’s cutest photos of all in honor of her big day.
Some of the most adorable moments of Queen Elizabeth‘s granddaughter have occurred at weddings. She captivated our hearts alongside her brother, Prince George, at Pippa Middleton‘s wedding, where she served as one of the bridesmaids. Since then, she’s perfected the craft of being a show-stealing wedding party member. At her uncle, Prince Harry‘s, wedding to Meghan Markle in May 2018, Charlotte stuck her tongue out at the crowd from the car she was riding in to St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.
After getting out of the car, the princess joined her parents and brother. She could be seen smiling at the crowd while holding a bouquet in one hand and her mom’s hand in the other. Later that year, she was a bridesmaid yet again at Princess Eugenie‘s wedding where she captivated onlookers by adorably waving to the crowds and cameras.
But weddings aren’t the only setting where Charlotte has stolen our hearts. From doing somersaults at Polo matches to waving at cameras while heading to the hospital to meet her baby brother Prince Louis, there’s been no shortage of sweet moments involving William and Kate’s daughter. Head up to the gallery above to see more of her cute pics! Happy birthday, Princess Charlotte!

    <h5 class="mb-1">'She's Lady Sarah Chatto's DOUBLE!' Royal fans go wild over 'uncanny' family resemblance between Princess Charlotte and the Queen's niece in childhood snaps</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Royal fans are going wild over  the 'uncanny' family resemblance between Princess Charlotte and the Queen's niece Lady Sarah Chatto in childhood snaps.
To mark her birthday, Kensington Palace has released new pictures of Charlotte as she helped her parents deliver home-made pasta to vulnerable Norfolk residents isolated by coronavirus earlier this week. 
And many have been left stunned by the likeness between Princess Charlotte, 5, and Princess Margaret's daughter Lady Sarah, 56, after royal expert Victoria Arbiter tweeted a side-by-side of the duo.
The post was quickly inundated with comments noting the similarities between the two royal ladies. 
One person said: 'I'm blue in the face from saying she is Lady Sarah's double since she was born.'
Meanwhile another commented: 'Amazing resemblance to her cousin.'
Another wrote: 'Oh wow! Look at that resemblance.'
Another added: 'I've always thought Charlotte favours Sarah.' 
After she shared the side-by-side comparison, Victoria commented: 'I've always thought she looked like Lady Sarah, but with them both aged 5 the resemblance is uncanny.' 
New commemorative portraits were, as usual, taken by keen amateur snapper Kate, earlier this week in between home schooling sessions at Anmer Hall, the family's Norfolk home on the Queen's Sandringham estate. 
The entire family helped out with a local initiative started by the monarch's staff, who have been preparing and delivering meals for pensioners and the vulnerable in the area during the lockdown.
After sharing four images of the little royal yesterday, the couple went on to thank fans for their well wishes and released a fifth picture today.
In the new snap, which was taken by Kate as part of the series, the little royal can be seen thoughtfully holding one of the parcels of pasta.
Around 1,000 meals were dispensed in the first week alone, and the scheme has been running for five weeks so far.
This time the Cambridges, all keen cooks, rustled up some home-made pasta which they separated into 12 large bags and tied up with raffia to add to the food parcels. Sources said all the children – even little Louis, two – were involved.
The following day, the family – Charlotte smartly dressed in a black and white checked dress with grey tights and black Mary Jane shoes – then helped to load bags of fresh produce into a van from the Sandringham Visitors' Centre ready for delivery.
Sources say William, Kate, Charlotte and George spent two and a half hours driving around the area delivering food to those in need.
The princess can even be seen in one picture proudly knocking on an elderly resident's door with her goodies, standing on a mat which reads 'Welcome Home, Wipe Your Feet'.

A third commented on the similarities between the young Cambridge and the Queen. They said: "She looks just like Queen Elizabeth...!!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">A 'very Happy fifth Birthday' Lottie! The Queen shares a throwback snap with Princess Charlotte as she and Prince Charles share their 'best wishes' with the little royal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Queen and Prince Charles were among the first members of the royal family to share their best wishes with Princess Charlotte as the youngster celebrates her fifth birthday today.
Taking to Instagram today, the Queen's, 93, official account shared several snaps of Her Majesty alongside the little royal, including one alongside Prince Philip taken at Trooping the Colour in 2017 
Meanwhile Prince Charles, 72, also shared his 'best wishes for a very happy birthday' with the five-year-old today, posting a portrait taken by Kate Middleton, 38, to mark the day.
To mark her birthday, Kensington Palace has released new pictures of Charlotte as she helped her parents deliver home-made pasta to vulnerable Norfolk residents isolated by coronavirus earlier this week.
Posting on Instagram today, the Royal Family account shared a series of images to mark the big day, including a photograph of the little royal acting as a flower girl at Princess Eugenie's wedding.
Other images in the series included one of Princess Charlotte with her mother Kate, the Queen and Prince Philip, 98, during Trooping the Colour in 2017.
Another sees the Queen surrounded by her grandchildren and greatgrandchildren, with Princess Charlotte taking centre stage on Her Majesty's lap.
The image is just one of a series of photographs that was shot by contributing photographer Leibovitz to mark the Queen's 90th birthday in April 2016. 
Meanwhile Prince Charles' account Clarence House posted just one image of the little royal, the commemorative image taken by the Duchess last week.
They wrote: 'Wishing Princess Charlotte a very Happy Birthday - five today!'
The daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who is currently isolating in Norfolk with her family, is likely to chat over the phone with her great-grandmother The Queen and other loved ones on her special day.
In spite of the extraordinary circumstances around her birthday this year, Kate Middleton and Prince William have reportedly planned a fun day for their daughter's birthday on their Anmer Hall home. 
A source told the Sun: 'The family has arranged a Zoom party for her, so she can speak to family and friends. Then, they have put together a full plan that will give her all the fun of a birthday – including cake and games – despite the extraordinary circumstances we are faced with.' 
'Her great-grandmother will be joining the family call on the big day. As far as Charlotte is concerned, the important part is that her whole family are by her side to say: "Happy Birthday".' 
New commemorative portraits were, as usual, taken by keen amateur snapper Kate, earlier this week in between home schooling sessions at Anmer Hall, the family's Norfolk home on the Queen's Sandringham estate.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In pictures: Princess Charlotte celebrates fifth birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain’s Princess Charlotte, daughter of Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton, celebrates her fifth birthday on Saturday – an occasion marked by the release of four new photographs of the young royal.
The pictures shared by the Royal account were taken by the Duchess of Cambridge. The post also shared an adorable caption.
“The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are very pleased to share four new photographs of Princess Charlotte ahead of her fifth birthday tomorrow.” it read. ” The images were taken by The Duchess as the family helped to pack up and deliver food packages for isolated pensioners in the local area.”
The photographs were taken last month by her mother at the Sandringham Estate in eastern England where the family helped to pack and deliver food parcels for isolated pensioners in the local area.
Last month, Charlotte’s great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth, the world’s oldest and longest-serving monarch, turned 94. However, there was little fanfare to mark that occasion as Britain endures a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus outbreak – its worst national crisis since World War Two.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte marks fifth birthday delivering food packages</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princess Charlotte's fifth birthday has been marked by the release of photographs showing the young royal helping to load a van with food and delivering meals for those in need.
Charlotte was volunteering with her parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and brothers Prince George and Prince Louis, ahead of her birthday which she celebrates on Saturday.
The princess is shown in two photographs holding white bags of fresh food for pensioners shielding themselves due to the coronavirus outbreak or other vulnerable people in lockdown in Norfolk.
In another image she knocks on the door of an elderly resident as she holds a bag of fresh pasta which William, Kate and their children spent several hours making the day before the delivery.
Four pictures, taken in April by Kate, have been released and the final photograph is a portrait of her daughter smiling as she looks straight at the camera.
The Cambridges got soaked as they made their rounds, likely to be in the area around their home of Anmer Hall which is on the Queen's Norfolk estate of Sandringham.
Over the past five weeks, the Queen's Sandringham staff have been preparing and delivering meals for pensioners and vulnerable people living in the local area, Buckingham Palace has said.
Around 1,000 meals were made and delivered in the first week alone.
It is not known if William was behind the wheel of the delivery van which was from the Sandringham Visitor Centre.
The birthday girl's full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge,.
She was born at the private maternity Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, central London, at 8.34am on May 2 2015, weighing 8lb 3oz.
Kate is a keen amateur photographer and patron of the Royal Photographic Society which has regularly released pictures she has taken of George, six, and Louis, two, to mark their birthdays.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte’s birthday: Her life in pictures so far</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The young royal, who has become known and loved for her cheekiness, sassiness and adorable royal waves to the press and public, will today be celebrating her birthday at home in Anmer Hall with her family. 
To mark the occasion of her fifth birthday, her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, have released new images of the youngster.
Snapped by keen amateur photographer Kate recently near their home in Norfolk, the photos show Charlotte lending a helping hand in the local neighbourhood.
The new photos were taken when Prince William, Kate and the kids helped pack up and deliver homemade pasta and food packages for the vulnerable and isolated pensioners living in their local area in Norfolk. 
The photos, published by Kensington Palace on social media, have received thousands of comments from well wishers.
So, as Princess Charlotte celebrates turning the grand old age of five, we look back at her life in pictures so far, from her first introduction to the public outside the Lindo Wing in London, to her first royal tour, day of school and the moment she proved she mastered her Great Grandmother’s iconic royal wave. 
Princess Charlotte of Cambridge was born on the May 2 2015 in the Lindo Wing at St Mary’s Hospital in London. 
The second child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, she joined her big brother Prince George in one of the most famous families in the world and became fourth in line to the British throne. 
Despite rumours that she may be named Alice, Kate and William chose the moniker Charlotte for their little girl, which just so happens to be the middle name of her aunt – Kate’s sister – Pippa Middleton.
She is also named in honour of two very important women in Prince William’s life – his grandmother the Queen and his late mother, Princess Diana.
Princess Charlotte’s full name is Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge.
There hasn’t been a member of the royal family called Charlotte in over two hundred years, so this little Princess was destined to make her mark and carve her own path. 
At the tender age of five, Princess Charlotte has already completed her fair share of royal duties and appearances, joining her parents on her first ever royal tour before she was 18 months old. 
Charlotte also joined her family on The Duke and Duchess’s official visit to Poland and Germany in July 2017.
Before joining her big brother Prince George at Thomas’s Battersea school in London in September last year, Princess Charlotte attended Willcocks Nursery School in London.
The feisty character was reportedly known as the ‘warrior princess’ at nursery thanks to her confidence. 
In March 2017, Kate revealed that Princess Charlotte was ‘the one in charge’ in their family and she was ‘very chatty and likes doing play dates with George.’
According to royal expert and author Katie Nicholl, Charlotte loves playing outside and exploring: ‘She loves climbing trees and she’s very much an adventurer, she was quite known for her feisty personality.’
Happy Birthday Charlotte!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte Turns 5, and Helps the Needy During Lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PRINCESS CHARLOTTE PITCHES IN: Princess Charlotte turned five on Saturday and to mark the milestone, Kensington Palace has released a series of photos that show the little royal helping the needy during lockdown.
The pictures, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge in April, were shot on Queen Elizabeth’s Sandringham estate in Norfolk, where members of the royal family helped to pack up and deliver food to isolated elderly people in the local area.
 
 
The Cambridges have been staying at their home, Anmer Hall, on the estate during the lockdown. Charlotte and her elder brother Prince George are still being schooled at home — just like most British children right now — and have also been showing their support for National Health Service during lockdown. They’ve been pictured clapping for NHS workers on Thursday evening.
Last month, their little brother Prince Louis was photographed making rainbows with finger paints to help spread some cheer in these dark days. The Duchess of Cambridge took those photos, too, to mark Louis’ second birthday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Princess Charlotte joins parents in charity food deliveries as she turns 5</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New photographs of Princess Charlotte have been released to mark her fifth birthday.
The young royal is seen helping to load a van with food and delivering meals for those in need amid the coronavirus crisis.
Charlotte was volunteering with her parents the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and brothers Prince George and Prince Louis, ahead of her birthday which she celebrates on Saturday.
The princess is shown in two photographs holding white bags of fresh food for pensioners shielding themselves due to the coronavirus outbreak or other vulnerable people in lockdown in Norfolk.
In another image she knocks on the door of an elderly resident as she holds a bag of fresh pasta which William, Kate and their children spent several hours making the day before the delivery.
Four pictures, taken in April by Kate, have been released and the final photograph is a portrait of her daughter smiling as she looks straight at the camera.
The Cambridges got soaked as they made their rounds, likely to be in the area around their home of Anmer Hall which is on the Queen’s Norfolk estate of Sandringham.
Over the past five weeks, the Queen’s Sandringham staff have been preparing and delivering meals for pensioners and vulnerable people living in the local area, Buckingham Palace has said.
Around 1,000 meals were made and delivered in the first week alone.
It is not known if William was behind the wheel of the delivery van which was from the Sandringham Visitor Centre.
The birthday girl’s full title is Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge.
She was born at the private maternity Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, central London, at 8.34am on May 2 2015, weighing 8lb 3oz.
Kate is a keen amateur photographer and patron of the Royal Photographic Society which has regularly released pictures she has taken of George, six, and Louis, two, to mark their birthdays.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In Pictures: Princess Charlotte turns five</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princess Charlotte, known for being one of the feistiest of the Queen’s great-grandchildren, is celebrating turning five.
Charlotte has been seen in recent weeks enthusiastically clapping for carers as the Cambridge family stay at their Anmer Hall mansion in Norfolk during the coronavirus pandemic.
Over the past year, the Duchess of Cambridge revealed that her daughter, whom she has been heard referring to by the nickname “Lottie”,  was “pretty good” with spicy food, and also liked olives.
One of Charlotte’s favourite books as a toddler was Julia Donaldson’s classic The Gruffalo, and the princess loves horses, just like her great-grandmother the Queen.
William and Kate’s middle child was born at 8.34am on May 2 2015, weighing 8lbs 3oz.
Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana of Cambridge made her debut on the steps of the Lindo Wing of St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, London, the same day.
Since her last birthday, Charlotte has joined her family to explore Kate’s Back To Nature garden at the Chelsea Flower Show.
Prince George and Charlotte took off their shoes and paddled barefoot in the stream during their May excursion, with the princess shouting “Ooh la la” as she waded through the water.
When William asked Charlotte “Will you help George?”, the princess retorted “no” before skipping off.
In June, the Cambridge children gathered with their parents on the Buckingham Palace balcony for Trooping The Colour, with Charlotte waving her arms around to greet the crowds.
The fourth in line to the throne also had fun at the King’s Cup regatta on the Isle of Wight in July.
She was spotted poking her tongue out during the presentation ceremony after her mother had encouraged her to wave.
The princess’s big day came in September when she started school.
She arrived for her first day with her parents and George, looking a little nervous at first as she fiddled with her pony tail, but excited as she met her headteacher.
The young royal joined the Windsors for the Queen’s annual pre-Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace in December.
She was driven to the royal residence by her mother for the festive celebration.
The princess also made her first appearance at church on the Sandringham estate on Christmas Day.
Charlotte and George joined the rest of the royals as they met the public on the traditional walk from Sandringham House to St Mary Magdalene Church.
One well-wisher gave the princess an inflatable flamingo and was rewarded with a hug.
A picture of Charlotte smelling a bluebell was released by Kate in February after the duchess spoke about how important being outside was for children.
The duchess was interviewed for the Happy Mum Happy Baby podcast hosted by Giovanna Fletcher.
Kate said: “I’ve got this one photo of Charlotte smelling a bluebell, and really for me, it’s moments like that mean so much to me as a parent.
“And I try every day to put moments like that in, even if they’re small or even if I don’t have time – but that in an ideal world is what I would like to do.”
A smiling Charlotte was seen applauding the country’s NHS workers in March, alongside George and younger brother Prince Louis.
She is being home schooled by William and Kate while the country is in lockdown.
But the duchess confessed it was “challenging” and admitted she kept her children in class during the Easter holidays to give their days “structure”.
She said it was not all “hardcore” as she found fun activities online and the children had been baking, cooking and pitching tents in the garden.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lili Reinhart Slams ‘Cancel Culture’ And Defends Boyfriend Cole Sprouse From All The ‘Vile’ Haters Trending #ColeSprouseIsOver On Twitter!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Twitter tried to cancel Cole Sprouse, the hashtag‘#colesprouseisover’ managing to trend on the social media page! However, his girlfriend and Riverdale co-star, Lili Reinhart, was quick to come to his defense against the ‘vile’ haters!
It was also the actress’ way of slamming the whole canceling trend, her message being pretty much a PSA against it as well!
In a series of tweets that have been deleted in the meantime, Lili made it very clear that she’d like people to stop with the ‘#colesprouseisoverparty’ tweets!
She also stressed just how sick and tired she was of the whole ‘cancel culture.’
‘Twitter is such a vile place. It’s so easy to say s**t behind your f***ing phone, isn’t it? This is why people keep their relationships private… this is why people do not have social media.. because of this bullying. I don’t tolerate any of that s**t. Bully me? Sure fine. But attacking somebody for no reason, just for the sake of a f***ing twitter trend? Please…. reassess yourself and your ego before you post another tweet into the abyss,’ she wrote.
And that was not all! Reinhart stressed that people really need to stop with the canceling parties as well!
After all, sometimes they just come out of nowhere with no reason, just like it happened to her man, Cole Sprouse.
‘It’s easy to criticize someone and spew hate because it makes you feel like you have some sort of power over them. Truth is… you do not. Saying you hate someone or do not like them gives you no power over them. You need to tweet about someone you do not know in order to feel you have something going on in your life? That is sad. It’s really f***ing sad.’
The Riverdale actress went on to tell haters that attacking people online will never help them feel validated like they’d like to.
Instead, she encouraged them to ‘be better’ and do something ‘helpful with [their] time.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lili Reinhart hits out at trolls 'bullying' boyfriend Cole Sprouse</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lili Reinhart hit out at trolls for ‘bullying’ her boyfriend Cole Sprouse on Twitter.
The Riverdale star saw that the hashtag #ColeSprouseIsOverParty was trending and decided to call people out in a lengthy rant.
However, it looks as though the hashtag is trending for no apparent reason as many used the tag just to ask why Cole was even ‘over’.
Lili wrote in a now-deleted post: ‘Twitter is such a vile place. It’s so easy to say shit behind your f**king phone, isn’t it? This is why people choose to keep their relationships private… this is why people don’t have social media.. because of this bullying.
‘Please…. reassess yourself and your ego before you send another tweet into the abyss.
‘I refuse to keep my mouth shut about things like this. You have no idea how destructive this can be to someone. To anyone. It’s abusive. There is no excuse for this. You need god in your life or some form of help if you participate in cancel culture.’
Cole has yet to respond to the hashtag.
This incident isn’t the first time the Suite Life of Zack and Cody star has been the target of online abuse.
Cole had a massive rant about fans sending him death threats over rumours about his dating life and keeping his private life private.
Lili later appeared to add her two cents about the matter.
Taking to Twitter, she wrote: ‘Twitter is actually the most toxic form of social media. People are a**holes for the sake of being a**holes.
‘Do you not understand karma? It’s fine if you don’t, you’ll understand when it bites your miserable a**.’
While The Hustlers star also vented on Instagram too, writing: ‘Dear everyone on social media, Don’t put down people for the sake of putting them down.
‘Don’t be a f**king a**hole. The world doesn’t need anymore of that shit.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Twitter Tried to Cancel Cole Sprouse & Lili Reinhart Defended Him</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">No one is quite sure why Twitter tried to cancel Cole Sprouse this week, but his girlfriend Lili Reinhart is not having it.
The actress took to Twitter to post a series of tweets, which have since been deleted, to slam those who were using the #ColeSprouseIsOverParty hashtag.
“Twitter is such a vile place. It’s so easy to say sh-t behind your f–king phone, isn’t it? This is why people choose to keep their relationships private… this is why people don’t have social media.. because of this bullying,” Lili wrote in a tweet that was since deleted.
“I don’t tolerate any of that s–t. Bully me? Sure fine. But attacking someone for literally no reason, just for the sake of a f–king twitter trend?” Lili continued. “Please… reassess yourself and your ego before you send another tweet into the abyss.”
“It’s easy to criticize someone and spew hate because it makes you feel like you have some sort of power over them,” Lili said. “Truth is… you don’t. Saying you hate someone or don’t like them gives you absolutely no power over them.”
“You need to tweet about someone you literally don’t know in order to feel like you have something going on in your life? That’s sad. It’s really f–king sad. You want to feel validated or important? Attacking someone online won’t give that to you. Do something helpful with your time and be better,” Lili concluded.
Lili and Cole, who both star on The CW’s Riverdale, have been a couple since 2017. Just a couple weeks ago, she spoke out amid rumors that they had split.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lili Reinhart Defends Cole Sprouse From ‘Vile’ Haters After Twitter Tries To Cancel Him</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It’s not too clear why May kicked off with a Twitter hate campaign against Cole Sprouse. However, his Riverdale co-star and girlfriend Lili Reinhart, 23, doesn’t need an explanation — she’d just like people to stop tweeting “#colesprouseisoverparty.” In a series of now-deleted tweets, Lili shared her frustrated thoughts on cancel culture: “Twitter is such a vile place. It’s so easy to say s–t behind your f–king phone, isn’t it? This is why people choose to keep their relationships private… this is why people don’t have social media.. because of this bullying.”
“I don’t tolerate any of that s–t. Bully me? Sure fine,” Lili continued in another tweet. “But attacking someone for literally no reason, just for the sake of a f–king twitter trend? Please…. reassess yourself and your ego before you send another tweet into the abyss.”
Lili continued to stress why fans need to stop hopping on Twitter cancel parties, which sometimes start trending from out of the blue (as in Cole’s case). “It’s easy to criticize someone and spew hate because it makes you feel like you have some sort of power over them. Truth is… you don’t. Saying you hate someone or don’t like them gives you absolutely no power over them,” Lili continued in yet another tweet. “You need to tweet about someone you literally don’t know in order to feel like you have something going on in your life? That’s sad. It’s really f–king sad. You want to feel validated or important? Attacking someone online won’t give that to you. Do something helpful with your time and be better.”
Lili made it clear that she won’t stay silent when it comes to cyberbullying. “I refuse to keep my mouth shut about things like this. You have no idea how destructive this can be to someone. To anyone. It’s abusive. There is no excuse for this. You need god in your life or some form of help if you participate in cancel culture,” Lili wrote, concluding her Twitter rant.
Meanwhile, Cole, 27, had to recently defend himself against dating rumors, after he was seen leaving the same car as 18-year-old model Kaia Gerber on March 19. “I tolerate a lot of rumors and slander from people online claiming to be my fans,” Cole wrote on his Instagram Story on April 19. “Fans who feel entitled to my privacy precisely because I never indulge them. But attacking my friends, baseless accusations, leaking my address and sending death threats are all qualities of insanity and fanaticism. Choose humanity, stop being [clown emoji].”
Cole then seemingly addressed his longtime off-again, on-again relationship with Lili, whom he first sparked dating rumors with in early 2017 (shortly after Riverdalepremiered). “When I first stepped into a public relationship, this was one of the foreseeable consequences,” Cole wrote in another Instagram Story post. “And while I truly never intended to indulge any part of my private life to the ravenous horde, it’s clear my restraint in updating them has allowed them to push their own agenda onto my habits and lifestyle.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gorillaz have released their latest single, “How Far?” as a tribute to the late Afrobeat drummer Tony Allen, who features on the song along with Skepta. Allen died last Thursday and was a pioneer of the Afrobeat genre, drumming with Fela Kuti for 15 years. Gorillaz frontman Damon Albarn was Allen’s bandmate in the supergroup Good, the Bad and the Queen, as well as a close friend and collaborator on other projects like Rocket Juice & the Moon. Albarn tweeted out a short video of Allen performing in concert captioned “There is no end,” following news of Allen’s death. “The track was written and recorded with Skepta in London just before lockdown and is being shared immediately as a tribute to the spirit of a great man, Tony Allen,” the band shared in a press release. “How Far?” is the latest single in the band’s “Song Machine” series.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gorillaz have paid homage to Tony Allen with a new song called “How Far.” The track features the late drummer, as well as English rapper Skepta.
“The track was written and recorded with Skepta in London just before lockdown and is being shared immediately as a tribute to the spirit of a great man, Tony Allen,” Gorillaz wrote in a statement.
The band also shared some inspiring words from the Afrobeat pioneer: “I want to take care of youngsters, they have messages and I want to bring them on my beat.”
Listen to “How Far” below.
Allen passed away on Thursday (April 30) at the age of 79. He was known for his work with Fela Kuti, and in his later years became a frequent collaborator and good friend to Gorillaz’ Damon Albarn. The two made music together as The Good, The Bad & The Queen, along with The Clash bassist Paul Simonon.
He also drummed on a project called Rocket Juice & The Moon with Albarn and Flea. The Red Hot Pepper bassist wrote a touching tribute to Allen on Instagram after hearing of his death. He called him his “hero” and “one of the greatest drummers to ever walk this earth.”

The world of music faced another tragic death this week after it was announced that legendary Afropop drummer Tony Allen passed away. Allen was revolutionary in helping pioneer the Afrobeats sound, though his musical resume expanded into other genres. Allen and Gorillaz' Damon Albarn were also in the supergroup The Good, the Bad and the Queen together that dabbled into rock, reggae, and dub.
In tribute to Allen, Gorillaz released their new single, "How Far?" which features Tony Allen and Skepta. The song was recorded in recent times, prior to the global lockdown. "The track was written and recorded with Skepta in London just before lockdown and is being shared immediately as a tribute to the spirit of a great man, Tony Allen,” it reads in a press release.
Allen died this week after suffering a heart attack. He worked closely with Fela Kuti who said that "without Tony Allen, there would be no afrobeat".
Check out the track below. RIP Tony Allen.
Quotable LyricsMore money, more problems and more ladiesEveryday somebody dies, still mothers give birth to more babiesThe earth spins, the world gets more crazyYou got to have a suit for the ChristeningA suit for the wedding and a suit for the court caseProbably wear the same suit to the funeralTryna see the bigger picture, man it's bigger than the portrait

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Maya Jama is getting really sick of all the d*** pics in her DMs.
Yes, the 25-year-old – who split from Stormzy last year – is a single lady in lockdown and no, she does not want to see your meat and two veg.
‘It always goes through my mind, like, “You’ve sent me a picture of your willy,”‘ she said in an Instagram Live.
‘Even if I loved the sight of you, I can’t respond to you now because I’ve just seen your willy.’
She’s got a fair point.
There’s still hope for all you lusty lot though, because the radio presenter does reply to her DMs sometimes – you just have to be funny.
She explained: ‘I never used to reply to DMs because I’d be like, “I don’t ever want to meet somebody through DMs.”
‘But obviously, recently I’ve replied to DMs. If somebody’s done a funny meme or a gif, or something like that makes me chuckle, that’s good.’
And while she’s not a fan of genitalia close-ups, Maya is a strong advocate of phone sex.
She said: ‘If you are confident enough to do it, phone sex is the movement. That’s what people have been doing for years in long distance.’
Hinting that she might try it out herself, the DJ added: ‘I need to practice my sexy voice on the phone and see where it goes.’
Reading, cleaning, practicing your phone sex voice… all your standard lockdown activities.
Maya – who jetted off on a break to the Maldives before lockdown struck – got stuck in the middle of some serious beef recently.
Wiley kicked off feud number 625 with Stormzy when he thirsted all over one of Maya’s Instagram snaps on Friday.
He commented under a photo of the presenter posing in the mirror: ‘I say this with respect “Looking like a bloodclart Snack”.’
Maya and Stormzy split up in August 2019 after four years together and the rapper is still heartbroken about it.
Stormzy admitted back in January that he’d still love to marry his ‘amazing’ ex and have her children.
Ever considered sending her a GIF on Insta, Stormzy? Just a thought.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">They say motherhood is nothing less than a bliss for a woman. However, what they don’t say are the struggles that come along with it. There’s no denying that raising a kid makes a woman feel complete in a very beautiful way, but there are little struggles that come along the tiny troublemakers. For example, giving mom a tough time with a series of dirty nappies, and this is exactly what Kalki Koechlin is going through.
Sharing a post of her few months old toddler Sappho’s smudged nappies, Kalki wrote - “Three in a row, in the space of five minutes😝 #shitgetsreal #parenting #clothnappies”.
This cracked up a number of social media users. One user wrote - “This is just the beginning😜. Enjoy your motherhood. 😍”, while another posted - “I can totally relate. It's good that it's not your hand or your clothes. I have faced far worse! 😂 But, this too shall pass!!! 😁. And since people could relate to, one of the users wrote - “Lol welcome to the bandwagon❤️” Earlier, Kalki posted a video of her strumming the ukulele and singing a Portuguese lullaby to Sappho, who was enjoying her laid back time in the cradle. That video too gave mommy goals and made the internet fall in love with Kalki.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Influencers are posting before-and-after photos to show how bloated women's bodies can get during their periods</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Maeve Madden
Although each woman is differently affected by her menstrual cycle, you'll be hard-pressed to find anyone who says she doesn't experience any sort of discomfort both before and during her period.
For many women, one of these unpleasant consequences is bloating.
Your stomach feels swollen and hard, you may feel puffy all over — it's not pleasant.
Period bloat is completely normal and occurs due to hormonal changes which result in water retention, however, it's not something many people talk about publicly.
For this reason, influencers who do show the reality of how their bodies change around their periods are being praised by their followers.
When personal trainer Courtney Pruce, for example, posted on her Instagram story that she was feeling "fluffy and swollen" due to her period, she received so many messages that she had to delete the post as her inbox was so overwhelmed.
"The general theme of the messages I received were all much of the same; lots of women sharing their past or repeated experience with getting the same physical affects pre-period," she told Insider.
Equally, London-based fitness influencer Maeve Madden recently shared two side-by-side images taken just a few days apart to show how much she bloats around her period, and she was wowed by how much it resonated.
Maeve Madden
Madden told Insider that the lead-up to her period is "chaos, physically and mentally, for at least a week."
She said that her bloat was particularly bad due to the extra stress of being under lockdown.
"I often talk about my period and the effects, especially not to feel guilty when taking time off to rest the body," she said.
"But this month was different, with the stress of COVID-19 there has been a huge effect on the body hormone balance, resulting in delayed, irregular, and heavy periods. This month for me I was way more anxious, swollen, and emotional than before, and I knew other women could relate to this."
Madden explained that she received an influx of direct messages in response to the post, but actually not as many public comments as she'd expected, which she found sad. 
"In 2020, is speaking openly about your period still a taboo subject? It's something women have had since the dawn of time ... It blows my mind," she said.
Madden's advice for women is to "track your cycle, know when it's coming, understand your body, and listen to how you're feeling.
"When someone tells you, 'Oh just drink water to debloat,' tell them where to go. Every body is different. I generally lead a healthy balanced lifestyle, and it happens to us all.
"If you know it's coming you can prepare yourself for it, although every month I still have a meltdown and want to quit my job."
Here are 10 influencers showing the reality of period bloat.
Maeve Madden
 
Alongside images taken just a few days apart, Madden said she was so swollen that her hands "looked like sausages."
"Yes your sweatpants really do get tighter during your period, even my bra doesn't fit and they are so sore."
Hayley Madigan
 
Trainer Hayley Madigan posted photos taken two days apart to highlight how much her body changes in the lead-up to her period.
She recommended avoiding weighing yourself and sticking to low-intensity workouts.
Victoria Grimes
 
Fitness influencer Victoria Grimes told her followers that not only does her stomach bloat during her period but her energy drops drastically, she feels depressed, she gets cramps, an upset stomach, and gas, and she's "moody and emotional."
Lauryn
 
Fitness micro-influencer Lauryn showed how different her body looks before and after her period by posting two photos taken just nine days apart.
"No, I wasn't pushing out my stomach in the picture on the left ... I just had so much bloating that my belly was hardened and poked out from my bust and down," she said. 
Janice Liou
 
"Camera angles are real, period bloat is real, the up and downs of life are real ... but you know what? You're not alone," said yoga teacher Janice Liou.
Erika Weiss
 
Personal trainer Erika Weiss pointed out that bloating is just water retention and is caused by a number of factors.
"Bloating is caused by water retention and can occur after huge DELICIOUS meals, PMS, heavily drinking on the weekends, traveling — you name it ... it's NORMAL," she wrote.
Gabrielle Rodriguez
 
Fitness influencer Gabrielle Rodriguez shared photos of her PMS body with and without posing and said: "Just because you see girls AND guys working angles and lighting, doesn't mean they don't have days where they feel like a whale too."
Instead of seeking ways to counteract bloat, she's urging her followers to embrace it.
Rachel Osiecki
 
Rachel Osiecki highlighted how simply by flexing or posing in a certain way, it's possible to hide period bloat in a photo.
"There are so many reasons your stomach may not be flat and all of them are natural," she said.
Kaitlin
 
Personal trainer Kaitlin stressed that period bloat, much like bloat of any kind, is not weight gain.
"[Your body] will change throughout the month," she said. "As we menstruate, as we ovulate, as we enjoy the f--- out of our Thanksgiving meal. IT'S OK!"
Dace
 
Personal trainer Dace described her period bloat as her "five months pregnant look."
"My stomach hurts and actually almost every muscle in my body is sore," she added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Millie Mackintosh and Hugo Taylor cuddle up as they head to hospital for birth</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Millie Mackintosh and her husband Hugo Taylor were pictured leaving their house to go to the hospital, clutching bags and suitcases, hours before welcoming their baby girl.
The couple, who welcomed their new arrival this week, were spotted hopping into a taxi on their way to the hospital.
All smiles, Hugo carried the bags, which included a suitcase, as well as some new pillows, with Millie still managing to look incredible in a black dress and long coat.
One sweet snap shows Millie cuddling up to her husband, before the pair of them set off on their way.
The happy news was confirmed by Hello!, with a statement reading: ‘We are delighted to announce the arrival of our darling girl who arrived on Friday 1 May at 1:21pm, weighing a very healthy seven pounds.
‘We are eternally grateful to the doctors, nurses and midwives for taking such good care of us.
‘Mum and baby are both doing incredibly well and we are looking forward to bringing our daughter home and spending time together as a family.’
This is the first baby for both Millie and her hubby Hugo, who tied the knot in 2018 after being friends for years and starring on Made In Chelsea together.
And the little one arrived just a day after Millie explained she’d be taking a break from social media to prepare for motherhood.
She wrote: ‘Signing off for a while – looking back on the last nine months, despite it’s challenges, it’s been a real blessing.
The unwavering support I’ve had from you all as a community has been such a comfort to me.
‘Social media, for all its negatives, really has some sparkling gems of positivity along the way and connecting with you all has really helped me through my pregnancy struggles.
‘When I return I shall continue to be open and honest sharing my experiences and early days of motherhood. 
‘Until then, it’s with a huge, heartfelt thank you from me for all the support. Now onto the next part of the journey!’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine have welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Harper May Stefanovic.
The Today host confirmed his happy news on Saturday morning, revealing Jasmine, 36, gave birth in Sydney on Friday.
"I am in awe. Harper is absolutely perfect," Stefanovic said in a statement to Nine. "Harper and Jasmine are doing well and dad had a great night’s sleep."
The Sydney Morning Herald understands the new 2.9-kilogram addition arrived via a planned Caesarean section at North Shore Private Hospital with the 45-year-old Stefanovic by his wife's side in the delivery suite.
Friend and fellow Nine employee Richard Wilkins also confirmed the exciting news on the Weekend Today Show.
"To Karl and Jas, you guys are going to love this special time in your life," Wilkins said on air.
The proud new parents shared a beautiful first photo of their daughter hours after her Friday arrival.
Sadly, friends and family close to the couple, including Karl's three older children aren't able to meet their new half-sibling due to the coronavirus and visitation restrictions at the hospital.
Jasmine's parents, Bob and Cheryl Yarbrough, are currently self-isolating in Sydney after arriving from their home in Ascot Hill, Brisbane. The first-time grandparents are understood to be overjoyed by Harper’s arrival and are staying in town to help care for the new baby.
The couple married in a lavish Mexican wedding in 2018 after they began dating in 2016. Karl shares three children – Jackson, 20, Ava, 15 and River, 12, with ex-wife Cassandra Thorburn.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Check her out! Princess Charlotte dons a Zara dress in houndstooth print loved by Princess Diana and Kate Middleton as she volunteers to deliver food to vulnerable people in birthday snaps</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Princess Charlotte donned a sold-out Zara houndstooth dress with £12 leggings as she volunteered to deliver food to vulnerable people in new portraits taken for the little royal's fifth birthday.
Kate Middleton, 38, and Prince William, 37, have released new pictures of Charlotte as she helped to deliver home-made pasta to vulnerable Norfolk residents isolated by coronavirus earlier this week.
In the snaps, the little princess can be seen wearing a sold-out houndstooth dress with a trendy distinctive ruffle from Zara, as well as a pair of £12 cosy grey leggings from Amaia Kids. 
The houndstooth print is a favourite of her mother Kate, who has often been seen in the pattern, as well as being favoured by the late Princess Diana.  
The monochrome houndstooth style is one that Princess Charlotte hasn't been seen in before - but it is loved by her mother, and she returns to time after time.
Kate has been seen in a selection of different check dresses and jackets in a variety of styles over the years. 
In January, the Duchess stepped out in a houndstooth gown, which like her daughter's was from high street brand Zara, was the first of Kate's houndstooth outfits to in cooperate another of her favourite trends - the pussybow neckline. 
The choice to wear the bold print by the usually demure duchess could also be seen as a nod to Princess Diana.
The late royal wore a red and white houndstooth jacket by Moschino with a black and white houndstooth skirt on several occasions. 
Princess Charlotte opted for the pattern as she joined the entire family to help out with a local initiative started by the monarch's staff.
New commemorative portraits were, as usual, taken by keen amateur snapper Kate, earlier this week in between home schooling sessions at Anmer Hall, the family's Norfolk home on the Queen's Sandringham estate. 
The family joined with staff, who have been preparing and delivering meals for pensioners and the vulnerable in the area during the lockdown.
After sharing four images of the little royal yesterday, the couple went on to thank fans for their well wishes and released a fifth picture today.
In the new snap, which was taken by Kate as part of the series, the little royal can be seen thoughtfully holding one of the parcels of pasta.
Around 1,000 meals were dispensed in the first week alone, and the scheme has been running for five weeks so far.
This time the Cambridges, all keen cooks, rustled up some home-made pasta which they separated into 12 large bags and tied up with raffia to add to the food parcels. Sources said all the children – even little Louis, two – were involved.
The following day, the family then helped to load bags of fresh produce into a van from the Sandringham Visitors' Centre ready for delivery.
Sources say William, Kate, Charlotte and George spent two and a half hours driving around the area delivering food to those in need.
The princess can even be seen in one picture proudly knocking on an elderly resident's door with her goodies, standing on a mat which reads 'Welcome Home, Wipe Your Feet'.
While she loves arts, crafts, modelling and, of course, the recent craze for 'slime', Princess Charlotte is not adverse to kicking a football around with her brothers or getting covered in mud.
The little princess also has a mischievous streak – famously poking her tongue out when she spotted her grandfather, Michael Middleton, in the crowd at The King's Cup regatta last summer.
And most were left utterly enchanted when they saw her skipping around her mother's show garden at Chelsea last year, completely carefree.

    <h5 class="mb-1">CONGRATULATIONS: Karl Stefanovic and Jasmine Yarbrough have welcomed their first child together.</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine Yarbrough have welcomed their first child together, a baby girl.
The baby news was announced on Saturday morning on Weekend Today by Stefanovic’s close friend and colleague, entertainment reporter Richard Wilkins.
Their daughter was born at North Shore Private Hospital in Sydney on May 1, just after midday.
The couple has named their daughter Harper May Stefanovic, with the new arrival weighing in at 2.9kg.
“Harper and Jasmine are doing well and dad had a great night’s sleep. I am in awe. Harper is absolutely perfect,” Stefanovic told Today.
Karl Stefanovic announced his wife's pregnancy in December 2019, sharing a paparazzi photo of himself emerging from the ocean while holidaying in Byron Bay.
"After a great deal of speculation… the rumours are true," Karl wrote, alongside a baby emoji.
The Channel Nine presenter met shoe designer Yarbrough onboard a luxury cruise ship in Sydney in 2016, five months following Stefanovic's divorce from his wife of 21 years, Cassandra Thorburn.
Since then, they’ve fielded many scandals along the way, starting from when the couple was forced to go public with their relationship in 2017 when they were pictured in Bora Bora on James Packer’s yacht.
At the time, Karl’s detractors thought he had moved on from his marriage too quickly. Their relationship became the catalyst for an onslaught of media attention, intense scrutiny and the ruthless intrusion of their personal lives.
But despite it all, the couple remained strong and they married in a lavish three-day wedding ceremony in San Jòse del Cabo, Mexico, in December 2018.
One year later, in December of last year, Karl and Jasmine announced they were expecting their first child together, a baby girl.
In April, Karl Stefanovic spoke to Stellar about his marriage with Jasmine.
"She’s been through so much... It’s not her fault she fell in love with bugalugs, and the accusations were wrong about her stealing me from Cassandra. It’s rubbish and it’s hurtful.
Karl admitted the relentless public scrutiny led him to ask Jasmine if she was sure she wanted to be in a relationship with him.
"There were times when I asked, ‘Do you really want to do this?’" he explained to the publication.
"She’s just a beautiful, sweet woman from Queensland who runs a business and fell in love with me."
Stefanovic has three children from his previous marriage with Cassandra Thorburn: Jackson, 20, Ava, 15, and River, 13.

    <h5 class="mb-1">PHOTO: Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine welcome baby girl</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine Yarbrough have announced the birth of their baby girl, Harper May Stefanovic.
The Today Show host shared the exciting news with the breakfast show early on Saturday morning.
“I am in Awe, Harper is absolutely perfect,” Stefanovic said.
The program uploaded an adorable photo of the couple’s new bundle of joy, writing “Karl Stefanovic and wife Jasmine Yarbrough have welcomed the arrival of a baby girl”.
Karl said Jasmine and bub are both doing well following the birth at Sydney’s North Shore Private Hospital on Friday.
It comes after the Mara & Mine shoe designer shared a photo to Instagram earlier this week, counting down their daughter’s arrival.
The couple tied the knot in a stunning ceremony in Mexico in December, 2018.
Harper May is a half-sister to Stefanovic’s three children Jackson, River, and Ava.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thank you for showing me true meaning of love - Khafi celebrates fiance Gedoni on his birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- BBNaija 2019 couple, Khafi and Gedoni, celebrated 'their birthday' on Saturday, May 2
- It was Gedoni's birthday but Khafi said his day is also her own and vice versa
- A video of their love journey was used to celebrate the special day
BBNaija 2019 couple Khafi and Gedoni's love has continued to wax stronger since they made it public after their engagement.
Theirs is not a love that is one-sided as both gush about each other at every given opportunity and that is exactly what Khafi has done by celebrating the love of her life Gedoni as he adds another year to his age.
Saturday, May 2, is Gedoni's birthday, and his affianced, Khafi, rather than tell too much story, decided to celebrate the love they have between them. She said that Gedoni's birthday is also her birthday so it is their birthday together.
In a short video of one minute, she appreciates Gedoni for the love he has shown her thus far as she noted that she never knew she will find through love but has found one in him. She also highlighted his qualities. She said he is gentle, generous, and genuine.
This is what BB Naija's Mercy Eke told ex-housemate and lover Ike that set social media on fire
She captioned the video:
"Today is our birthday. Yes, our birthday because I am you and you are me. Your full name means God's blessings, and I can't tell you how much that is what you are to me. I thank you for showing me the true meaning of love and loving every part of me. The good, the bad, and the parts no one else sees. Trying to put this altogether in a video is just a fraction, but just know that I love you. Now and always. Happy birthday my baby"

Meanwhile, Legit.ng had previously reported that Saturday, April 4, would have been Khafi and Gedoni's wedding day but it was cancelled.
The bride-to-be, Khafi, took to her social media page, Instagram, and her Youtube channel, to announce what led to the cancellation of her wedding to the love of her life.

On Instagram, Khafi who could have gotten away with getting married with less fuss as many were not aware of her wedding date wrote: "A lot of people don't know this but I was supposed to be getting married today."
She further noted that she had planned getting married on April 4, but her mother kicked against it, asking for more time for the family to prepare for the couple's big day.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chris Evans joins Instagram for a cause</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Los Angeles: "Captain America" star Chris Evans has finally joined Instagram to raise funds for the fight against the novel coronavirus.
Evans made his debut on the photo-sharing website on May 1 and shared that he is taking part in the All In Challenge, launched to help raise money to fight hunger during the COVID-19 pandemic, reports aceshowbiz.com.
In his debut video Evan says: "A virtual hangout with me and five of my closest friends.
He was referring to his "Avengers" co-stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner.
"We can do a private Q&A. You can ask us anything. We'll spill the beans. And then maybe some games."
Evans feels the cause should encourage fans to join in. "This is a great cause. This helps people who are in need during this COVID nightmare. So I am very happy to be doing this."
He then passed the challenge to fellow Marvel star friends, Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie, as well as "Pose" star Billy Porter.
The actor's challenge page shared details that the offer of hanging out goes to one lucky winner and two friends.
"100 per cent of the money raised through this Game/Auction will go directly to Feeding America, Meals On Wheels, World Central Kitchen and No Kid Hungry," read his statement.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chris Evans has joined Instagram and offered a virtual hangout with the Avengers as part of the All-In Challenge.
Evans, who plays Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, is the latest celebrity to offer fans a once-in-a-lifetime experience in aid of the coronavirus relief effort.
He had been nominated by his fellow Hollywood actor Chris Pratt, who is auctioning off the chance to be eaten by a dinosaur in the new Jurassic World film.
Announcing his own prize – a virtual meeting with his Avengers co-stars – Evans posted his maiden Instagram video and said: “This is a great cause, this helps get food to people who are in need during this Covid nightmare, so I am very happy to be doing this.
“Now I saw what Pratt is offering, I can’t compete with that, I can’t get you eaten by a dinosaur. But here’s what I can offer: a virtual hang out with me and five of my closest friends: Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner.”
Evans, 38, added: “We can do a private Q&A, you can ask us anything, we’ll spill the beans, then maybe some games. I would recommend Scattergories.”
He then nominated Marvel actors Sebastian Stan and Anthony Mackie as well as Pose star Billy Porter.

Other celebrities taking part include Leonardo DiCaprio, Drake and Kim Kardashian West.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chris Evans knew what we wanted and is reuniting the Avengers for a charity zoom hangout.
Captain America will be having a virtual hangout with the original six heroes, including Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner (Iron Man, Black Widow, Thor, Hulk and Hawkeye), and it’s all for a good cause.
But wait, there’s more.
Fans can enter for a chance to join the call by donating to the All-In Challenge, which helps organisations providing food to people during the coronavirus pandemic.
In a video posted to Chris’s Instagram, he said: ‘We can do a private Q&A. You can ask us anything. We’ll spill the beans. And then maybe some games.’
Games with the Avengers? We’re in.
A host of other celebrities are also taking part in the All-In Challenge – a fundraiser created by Philadelphia 76ers basketballer Michael Rubin.
Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert De Niro have offered an amazing walk-on role on their next film, Martin Scorsese’s Killers Of The Flower Moon.
A chat with the Avengers and a role with Leo and our best pal Rob?
That’s not all as Pearl Jam’s Eddie Vedder has also joined to raise money for relief efforts, offering a special concert ‘birthday package’ that includes a chance to join the band on stage.
The winner and a guest would get to attend the Pearl Jam show of their choice — it doesn’t actually have to be on their birthday, it could be anything.
Fans get to start the day at the band’s soundcheck where they’ll get to see how the setlist comes together, and even offer a bit of input on song choices to Vedder.
The fund has raised $5.6 million (£4.4m) in just three days.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Victoria Beckham has given fans a glimpse of her family’s celebration for husband David’s birthday.
The star turned 45 on Saturday and enjoyed the day with his family at home.
Victoria, 46, who recently reversed her decision to furlough staff at her fashion label, posted a video of David blowing out candles on a cake.
“Happy Birthday David Beckham!! We we love you so, so much,” she wrote.
Their children – apart from Brooklyn Beckham who is in lockdown in the US with his girlfriend – could be heard singing “Happy birthday” with David joking it should be a “bit more upbeat”.
Victoria also posted an old snap of the couple walking their dogs in Manchester.
“Remembering our walks with Snoop and Puffy in Manchester all those years ago.
“Still dog walking together 23 years later. Love you so much,” she said.
Victoria declared David to be the “best daddy” and wrote: “Celebrating in lockdown and missing Brooklyn Beckham and all our friends and family today.”
And she also showed off the personalised wrapping paper containing David’s presents.
“I’m quite obsessed with it,” she said of the paper, featuring his face.
Victoria made a U-turn about furloughing staff at her fashion label following controversy over the decision.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Victoria Beckham pays sweet birthday tribute to husband David with adorable family video</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VICTORIA Beckham paid a sweet birthday tribute to husband David today as he celebrates turning 45.
The designer put together an adorable family video montage on Instagram featuring loads of cute Beckham moments.
Giving a detailed glimpse into their life over the years, David could be seen being affectionate with his wife as well as being a doting dad to their four kids.
Victoria's first snap was a throwback of the pair walking their dogs Snoop and Puffy in Manchester in 1997.
She wrote: "Happy birthday @davidbeckham x Remembering our walks with Snoop and Puffy in Manchester all those years ago. Still dog walking together 23 years later. Love you so much x
The video collection followed with a bittersweet caption about how they were missing eldest son Brooklyn, family and friends in lockdown.
On her Instagram stories, Victoria shared a picture of David's birthday breakfast: a bacon and egg sarnie with ketchup.
His presents were covered in wrapping paper with his face on for an extra personal touch.
David's kids also wished him well, with Romeo writing: ""Happy birthday dad I love you so so so so much and hope you have the best day ♥️sorry for being officially taller than you now 😂♥️."
While Cruz posted: "Dad, I love you so much happy birthday have a great day ❤️❤️❤️."
The tribute comes a day after Victoria made a U-turn - and pledged to reverse her decision to furlough staff.
The star has decided against a government bail-out following a furious backlash from the public.
News of her change of heart comes after the Sun on Sunday revealed the 46-year-old designer’s company was using Chancellor Rishi Sunak’s scheme to furlough 25 members of staff - despite being boasting a family worth of £335million.
A source added: “Victoria is devastated about the backlash she’s faced.
“The original decision to furlough wasn’t actually hers - it was more a board thing, and she was persuaded that it was the right thing to do. Obviously she now realises this is wrong.
“Victoria realises she still has some way to go when it comes to endearing herself again with the great British public, but she is going to use her position and influence to start giving more back.”
The former Spice Girl, married to ex-England captain David, has had a relatively rough few months.
Her business empire has taken numerous hits, and in November it emerged the company had recorded losses of over £12million.
She has also made dramatic cuts to the business empire, slashing her own salary and even losing the use of her chauffeur.
Since its formation in 2008, it has made losses of around £35million - despite boasting celebrity fans including Michelle Obama, Cara Delevingne, Jennifer Lopez and Meghan Markle.
And after news of her decision to furlough staff emerged - albeit on an ‘enhanced package’ - social media was flooded with scathing comments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Victoria Beckham shares unseen footage to celebrate David's 45th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Victoria Beckham has shared a heartwarming video montage to celebrate her husband David's 45th birthday today.
The fashion designer, 46, shared the clip this morning showing nostalgic unseen videos and pictures, and had The Doobie Brothers hit Long Train Runnin' playing in the background.
A clip also shows son Brooklyn, 21, surprising his dad for his 43rd birthday.
She also shared a snap in a separate post of the pair walking Rottweilers Snoop and Puffy in Manchester 23 years ago.
The former Spice Girl Victoria captioned her post: "Happy birthday @DavidBeckhamx Remembering our walks with Snoop and Puffy in Manchester all those years ago."
David was also seen in a video with his family walking through Disneyland Florida wearing Mickey Mouse ears on over his black baseball cap.
Cruz and Romeo were also shown playing guitars when they were children.
Another snap shows the Beckham family sat on the front row at one of her fashion shows.
The family were also seen in a throwback pic when they were at the Grand Canyon in the US.
She captioned her sweet montage: "Happy bday to the best daddy. Celebrating in lockdown and missing @brooklynbeckham and all our friends and family today. We all love you so much xxx', she captioned the post."
Many fans rushed to the comments section to send David well wishes.
One wrote: "Many happy returns to the most wonderful David!"
Victoria also shared a picture of a bacon and egg sandwich on her Instagram stories with "love" written in tomato ketchup, which was captioned "happy birthday David Beckham".
This week Victoria reversed her decision to furlough 30 employees at her fashion company after coming under immense criticism.
The entrepreneur, who has a combined fortune of £335 million with husband David, opted to use the government bail out scheme and use tax-payers' money to pay 80% of her staff's wages while they are at home.
However, Posh has now undergone a change of heart after being 'devastated' by the public reaction.
Her fashion brand had earlier sent letters to staff warning them that they were going to be furloughed under the Government's scheme for two months.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Another Bachelor baby is on the way!
Original The Bachelor Australia couple Tim Robards and Anna Heinrich have announced they’re having a baby.
The pair both took to social media on Saturday to share the exciting news with fans.
“It’s been so hard to keep this a secret, over the past few months, but I can now finally shout… I’M PREGNANT!!!” Heinrich wrote alongside a collage of adorable photos.
“With everything that’s going on in the world we feel incredibly lucky and grateful to be starting a family together, and we’re so looking forward to this next chapter in our lives.”
Tim also revealed his excitement to become a father.
“We’ve been keeping busy in lockdown,” The Neighbours TV star joked.
“I can’t wait to be a Dad!!! The giddy feelings in my stomach show there must be a few nerves, but I know Anna’s going to be an absolutely amazing mother and I couldn’t be more excited to start a family with her!”
The couple met on the first season of The Bachelor Australia  in 2013, and tied the knot in a magical ceremony in Italy in 2018.

There were rumours about Krishna’s secret marriage with Eban after he addressed her as ‘wifey’ in his Instagram stories. During the recent chat with Mumbai mirror, she opened up about it and said, “hilarious, just a term. And it’s crazy how there are so many articles saying we were secretly married. Even my mum asked me what was going on.”
Opening about Eban, Krishna revealed that she met him through a common friend whom she was meeting after a long time. She was quoted as saying, “I was catching up with a friend of his whom I hadn’t met in a long time, but eventually ended up chatting with Eban. Eban and Tiger have played basketball together but he never knew that Tiger has a sister.”
Talking about family’s response on their relationship, she stated that they will be involved but for now they are trying to spend more and more time together. She said, “They don’t interfere much, they trust my judgement. Families eventually do get involved, but I’d like to take my time and keep it between us for now.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Krishna Shroff shares loved-up photos with beau Eban Hyams while he spends quarantine time Australia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Krishna Shroff seems to be missing beau Eban Hyams as he jetted off to Australia recently. She posted a few loved-up photos on Instagram, which seem to be from one of their many fun outings. The couple was together during lockdown and was making the most of it by doling out massive fitness goals.
Eban’s Instagram story recently had a post which read, ‘Last day in Mumbai’, he had also tagged Krishna’s mother Ayesha Shroff and written, “Gonna miss them”. While in another post he had thanked Krishna and Ayesha Shroff, “Thank you both for the amazing company through these crazy times. Blessed to have you both in my life. See you again soon.” Eban has been posting glimpses of his quarantine life in Sydney.
Speaking about her family accepting Eban, Krishna told Mumbai Mirror in an interview, “They don’t interfere much, they trust my judgement. Families eventually do get involved, but I’d like to take my time and keep it between us for now.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Not just child's play! Mother delights in dressing up her one-year-old daughter in HILARIOUS costumes to recreate famous movie scenes - including Kill Bill and Hellboy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A baby girl is recreating famous movie and TV scenes - including Die Hard and Silence of the Lambs.
Evie Simpson wears a variety of costumes, wigs, makeup and props to copy clips from The Matrix, Hellboy, Breaking Bad and Kill Bill.
Her mum Jessica Simpson, 32, a business manager from Indian Queens, Cornwall, started the photoshoots as a joke for family and friends, but now spends hours making the perfect setting for her shots.
She uses her daughter, Evie, who is twenty-months-old, to pose as the actors with the versatile tot pulling off roles of household names from Uma Thurman in Kill Bill to the Anthony Hopkins serial killer.
In one image, young Evie can be seen crawling towards the camera just like Bruce did in the 1988 action film.
In another, dressed as the infamous Hannibal Lecter, Evie is snarling at the camera while holding a knife and fork.
She has also reprised Gerard Butler's role as Leonidas in cartoon-epic 300, complete with a six-pack and abs drawn on with make up.
Other film roles she has stared in have included The Matrix and Hellboy. 
And she has also been Tom Hanks, Marilyn Monroe and Emilia Clarke as Daenarys Targaryen from Game of Thrones - complete with white hair, astride a dragon.
In addition to the movie scenes, Evie has also played the roles of singers including Madonna and Britney Spears.
Jessica started it as a joke but her family and friends love it, regularly sending her messages asking for the next instalment.
She said: 'I'd seen something similar online, I think someone was doing book characters. 
'It was just supposed to be a laugh but it went down really well.
'It feels to me like they're really hashed together but I get lots of messages asking for the next one.'
Jessica creates a new image each month, and every time the new subject is a closely guarded secret until the big reveal.
It started last year, when the mum-of-two dressed up her eldest child as celebrities who were enjoying their birthday that month. 
She added: 'That's how it started, but now we're focusing on movie scenes. We have just done Bruce Willis in Die Hard.
'I got a box from work and lined it with tin foil, then I got a battery powered tea light and made it look like a lighter.
'I had to dirty up one of her vests and put some eye liner on her face to look like stubble.'
Jessica added: 'We've also done Marilyn Monroe, Gerard Butler, and Tom Hanks.
'Now we're doing scenes from movies, we've done Trinity in The Matrix and Hellboy.'
She explained: 'I jot down ideas when I get them but I don't plan too much. I look at what films have been released that month and pick my favourite.
'The one for next month is planned, but that's it. I can't tell you what it is, it's a secret.'

Actress, Mercy Aigbe, has revealed that for a long time, she had a crush on ‘African Queen’ singer, 2baba (formerly 2face Idibia).
Aigbe stated this during the week as a guest on Gbenga Adeyinka’s Instagram Live chat. After Adeyinka played ‘African Queen’ while on the video call, Aigbe said with a broad smile, “Don’t tell anybody o. For a very long time, I had a crush on 2baba.”
The fashionable role interpreter also stated that before she got into the industry, she admired Liz Benson and Sola Sobowale. She said, “Coming into the industry, there were two people I admired a lot— Liz Benson and Sola Sobowale. Liz Benson was just so beautiful and she still is. I absolutely loved her back then. I also loved the way Sola Sobowale interpreted her roles. She inspires me whenever I see her on a movie set.”
Recounting the first encounter she had with Sobowale, Aigbe said, “Before I got into the industry, I admired Sola Sobowale because she knows her onions. One day, I got a call to come on set for a movie titled, ‘Ohun Oko So Mi Da’.
“The movie was produced by Aunty Sola and I was shivering when I got to the set. I asked myself, ‘Would I be able to act in the presence of my role model?’ I went to a corner and prayed to God and told myself, ‘This is my opportunity. I shouldn’t allow Aunty Sola overshadow me. I should let my star shine.’
“Unfortunately for me, in that particular scene, I wasn’t meant to talk at all. I acted the role of her husband’s secretary and was dating her husband. She came to my character’s house to warn her. I was not supposed to say anything but I thought that as an up-and-coming actress, she would just kill my ‘star’ if I didn’t say anything. Guess what I did. I gave myself lines. As she was ranting, I was reacting to her rants. When she held me, I put my hands inside her brassiere. She just told the director to end the scene at that point, asking where they found ‘this kind of girl’.”
The ‘77 Bullets’ actress also maintained that she learnt consistency and doggedness from her mother. She added, “I learnt being dogged from my mum. She is a very strong woman, who never gives up. She is very consistent and hardworking. I believe that whatever one wants to do, one has to keep at it until one succeeds.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Katie Price finally reunites with Bunny after she and Jett quarantined at dad Kieran Hayler's</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Doting mum Katie Price has been reunited with the youngest of her brood.
Katie, 41, shared a series of clips of her and Bunny, five, spending Sunday together with drawing and nail painting.
Bunny and her brother Jett, six, have been spending lockdown with their dad Kieran, as Katie self-isolated with eldest lad Harvey.
"This is my picture for my mummy," Bunny tells the camera, "It's me, her and Blade."
Blade is Katie's beloved dog, but she was focused on another part of the drawing.
"So I've got no hair?" Katie laughed.
Bunny frowns, then leaves to make amendments to her drawing.
Another clip shows Bunny wearing fake nails.
"You've done that this morning all by yourself?" an impressed Katie asks, "They're just like mummy's!"
The star captioned the clip: "Sunday morning fun with my Bunny bops."
Later in her Instagram Stories, as Katie speaks to the camera, we see Jett cuddled up to her.
She recently opened up about what it was like to see Junior, 14, and Princess, 12, again after six weeks apart.
The pair, who she shares with Peter Andre, had been isolating at their dad's.
Katie, for one, couldn't believe how much the teens had changed.
"I can't believe how much the kids have grown in six weeks," she told The Sun, "Pete's had them sleeping in growing bags!
"I welled up, it's been a tough six weeks not being able to hug them."
Katie's ready for a one off special of her show Katie Price: My Crazy Life to air on Monday night.
In a preview clip, she dishes about her past and how she's ready to move on to a new chapter.
"Four weeks in hospital and some intensive therapy that will continue for the rest of my life," she said.
"I've been to hell and back and I'm starting to feel like me again."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Celebrity mum Stacey Solomon has filmed herself sitting on the toilet after being rudely interrupted by her son Rex.
Stacey, 30, was trying to take a moment to herself when her 11-month-old baby barged in to say hello.
In scenes familiar to parents everywhere, the Loose Women star captured the funny moment on camera before sharing it online.

Stacey's legs can be seen as she asks: "Can I go to the toilet please? Can I? Can I go to the toilet in peace?"
The mum-of-three also captioned her Instagram stories post: "When you don't shut the toilet door properly.
"Haven't finished a poo since [I] became a mum in 2008."
Stacey, who welcomed Rex into the world with long-term boyfriend Joe Swash in May 2019, is loved for her honesty about parenting.
The star is also mum to Zachery and Leighton from previous relationships and she isn't shy about documenting her motherhood journey online.
Following the toilet incident, Stacey revealed that she was having quite a day with Rex. In another clip, the star managed to film herself as she held the tot in one arm and peeled potatoes with her other hand.
She admitted; "He has decided against the morning nap and also does not want to be put down...at all!"
Breaking into Blue's hit song One Love, Stacey sang: "It's okay. I'll just have to do everything with...one hand, for the mother's cry, one hand, for the times we cry!"
Meanwhile, on Saturday night (May 2, 2020), Stacey experienced a dramatic near miss thanks to Joe, 38.
The Dancing On Ice 2020 winner convinced Stacey to perform a move he had learned on the ITV show...and almost dropped her!
As one of her older sons filmed, Stacey said: "I don't want to do it, give me my phone back.
"No, I'm not going backwards, no, what the hell?! What the hell, Joe?!"
Stacey was then seen yelping as Joe tried, and failed, to elegantly hoist her onto his shoulder.
She then screamed: "How did you win this, Joe? I'll dismount the other way! No, Joe, no!"

Thankfully Stacey made it back down to the ground in one piece...and all was forgiven within a few hours.
The couple were snapped cuddled up together with their pet dog before heading to bed. Phew!

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Huge and very creepy': Vancouver Island woman stumbles upon rarely seen spider</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">VANCOUVER -- Krysten Leigh was walking her dog in Langford when she spotted something that made her do a double-take.
"He was pulling at something and it got my attention and when I looked over there was a spider," Leigh said. "I definitely had to take a second look because it was huge and very creepy-looking."
The arachnid on the pavement in front of her was like nothing she'd ever seen before. She wondered if it was someone's pet. She also wondered if it was poisonous. Mostly, she knew she had to take a picture.
"It wasn't as big as a tarantula, but it definitely looked like a miniature version of one," Leigh said.
Experts say the spider she spotted is a Pacific folding trap-door spider. It's not a tarantula, but it is a "tarantuloid" - a related type of arachnid - according to Jaymie Chudiak, general manager of the Victoria Bug Zoo.
"It is the closest thing we have to a tarantula," Chudiak said. "They are incredibly beautiful, but also very large, so people who do see them go, 'Oh my gosh, what is that? It's enormous.' But they're actually extremely docile and timid."
Pacific folding trap-door spiders typically grow to between three and five centimetres in length, considerably smaller than tarantulas, but larger than most species commonly seen in B.C.
"They do have venom, but it's incredibly mild," Chudiak added.
Asked what she did after she took the photo, Leigh said she "ran away."
"I was terrified," she said. "I'm definitely not a spider person."
She shared the photo she had taken with her mother, and then with a pest control company, which was eventually able to confirm the spider was a native species and not an escaped pet.
Leigh then shared the photo on Facebook, where it generated much more attention than she expected. In the first 24 hours, her post was shared more than 200 times, she said.
Chudiak said Pacific folding trap-door spiders are "absolutely everywhere" on Vancouver Island, but people rarely see them because they spend most of their lives hidden away inside their burrows.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020

Ivy Jane is seen helping her daddy brush his teeth.
Jessa Duggar took to her Instagram account recently to share a video of her husband, Ben Seewald, and their 11-month-old daughter, Ivy Jane. The Counting On star captured an adorable moment between the two that had her fans melting once again.
Ben is multitasking as he is seen holding the baby girl in his arms at the same time that he is busy brushing his teeth. Ivy is very interested in what her daddy is doing. She has her mouth open looking like she wants to do the same thing, She is attempting to put the other end of the toothbrush in her own mouth. The Duggar son-in-law finally gives in and lets her do it. They share the cutest father-daughter moment as they both grin at each other.
When Ben realizes that his daughter wasn’t about to let go, he guided his hand over hers and they both brushed his teeth together. Ivy thought that was pretty cool as she smiled big. It appears that they were either getting ready for the day or getting ready for bed. Ben is in a white t-shirt and sporting a bit of a beard once again. Ivy Jane is seen wearing pink pajamas with a rainbow and unicorn print.
Jessa Duggar was filming the whole thing and posted it on the social media platform. You could hear her talking softly in the background. She then walked into the bathroom, picked up Ivy’s little toothbrush, and began brushing her baby teeth. The little girl seemed to love it.
Duggar fans were so excited to see how big Ivy Jane is getting and watching her interact with Ben. The comments were all about how sweet she is.
“OMGGGGG Indeed the cutest‼️” one fan said.
“She’s so beautiful, she has the best eyes,” another follower mentioned.
“I cannot even wrap my head around how cute this is,” someone else said.
Jessa also loved seeing her two family members in such a sweet moment as she deemed it the “cutest” thing she has ever seen.
The 27-year-old reality star is no stranger to sharing her three kids with her 2.2 million Instagram followers. Just about a week ago, she posted a cute story of her eldest, Spurgeon, 4, wanting to add some salt to the eggs that she was making for breakfast. He assumed that the S on the salt shaker was meant for him. There certainly doesn’t seem to be any shortages of adorableness in the Seewald household.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mom Accidentally Names Her Child 'Lasagna,' Discovers Only Months Later</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Parents-to-be spend months picking out the perfect name for their impending arrival, but one new mom’s sweet intention to honor her late grandmother-in-law inadvertently led to a humorous moniker. In a Reddit threat first reported on by Cafe Mom, a newly-minted mother recalled how she had accidentally named her daughter "lasagna."
In the post, the mother explained how she and her husband had welcomed their first child, a daughter, about nine weeks ago. After learning that they were expecting a girl, they immediately decided on a name: Elizabeth Jane, with the intent to call her EJ. However, those plans changed when, seven months into her pregnancy, her husband’s grandmother Anya lost her battle to breast cancer. Wishing to pay tribute to her, the expectant mom decided to change her daughter’s name to Anya, writing that "my husband and his family were touched and agreed so our daughter became Elizabeth Anya Jane Last-Name." It wasn't long before she realized the uncanny nickname her daughter would have.
"We've been having frequent group Skype sessions with family during the stay-home mandate so our families can see the baby, see us, see each other and stay connected," she continued. "My sister pointed out that we named our baby 'Lasagna.' I hadn't made the mental connection but if you put her first and second names together 'Liz Ayna' it really does make 'lasagna.'"
Now, the mother wrote, the nickname seems to have stuck and "everyone keeps calling my daughter 'Lasagna.'" Although it may seem like something to laugh about, the mother expressed her fear that the moniker will lead to mocking once her baby girl enters school. The name has even stuck with her family, with her sister telling her that if she didn't want her daughter to get teased "then I shouldn't have named her what I did."
"They won't stop and every time I protest they remind me that I'm the one who named her so I've made my bed," the mom continued, revealing that she is no longer speaking with her family after she requested that they stopped calling her daughter "lasagna" and they refused. "Have I brought this on myself?"
Of course, Redditors were quick to show their support, with one person writing "it's ok that you didn't catch it" while a second person commented that "your family should drop it once you said it bothered you." Several other suggested that she change her daughter’s name to Elizabeth Jane Anya or Anya Elizabeth. In an update, the mom said that after discussing it over with her husband, they came to the decision "to legally have her middle names switched around, so we just need to figure out a time to get down to the courthouse and do that."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A new mother who went through the heartbreak of losing five babies in her desperate journey to become a mum finally has reason to smile - after she gave birth to a beautiful baby girl.
Danielle Wilson, 24, from Peterborough, was left battling depression after she suffered five devastating miscarriages as she desperately tried to fulfil her dream of becoming a mum.
When the mortgage underwriter fell pregnant for a sixth time, she and her partner Edward Painter, 32, prepared themselves for more heartbreak.
But she was overjoyed when she gave birth to daughter Georgia on March 16, saying: 'If I hadn't gone through all that, I wouldn't have had her today so it was all worth it.'
Danielle had her first miscarriage in March 2016, at almost six weeks and says the doctors weren't alarmed as it was only her first one.
Sadly, a few months later, in October 2016, she experienced the second one and although she was devastated she still didn't have any medical explanation.
Danielle fell pregnant again but in July 2018 she had another miscarriage- it was then when she started getting worried and decided to look more into it.
Danielle said: 'The first time I was only about six weeks when I started bleeding- the doctors weren't worried because it was my first miscarriage.
'I had only known for about a week when I had the pregnancy test so it was quite a wild ride from being happy to 'this has happened' - It was very hard for me.'
Danielle explained: 'The second time it was the same scenario again, I got all happy when I had the pregnancy test, I didn't really learn from my past mistake and I told all my family because I didn't think it was going to happen again.'
But she was left devastated and disappointed by the reaction of medical professionals.
She said: 'Doctors don't run any tests until you have three miscarriages- I was just told "It's common, one of those things".
'At that point I started to notice a pattern and I was apprehensive - apparently it's quite common to happen the first time but surely not common to happen again and again.
'The next time I took the pregnancy test at four weeks and at six I miscarried again so I knew there was a problem with me.
'My miscarriages made me feel like a complete failure as a woman, like I could not do what I should be able to do.
'Especially as Ed has two lovely little girls from a previous relationship, although he knew what I had been through as we had been friends for years, it still devastated me that I may not be able to give him what another woman could.'
Danielle asked her GP to refer her to the miscarriage clinic at her local hospital but she says it was 'disappointing' and got told she is young and 'it's just one of those things'.
She said: 'The doctor asked me some questions and followed up with "You're young and healthy, there's no reason to believe there is anything wrong, it's probably just one of those things-you may not have even been pregnant, they could have been false positives"- I just sat there, mortified.
'The miscarriage clinic was in the maternity ward so I was surrounded by pregnant women as well, which was awful.
'I felt so lost, I thought we were going to get the answers we so desperately wanted.
'In a way I was hoping something was wrong with me so they could fix it, it was frustrating seeing all the results coming back fine. '
After a long research she ended up booking her first appointment, at Tommy's National Centre for Miscarriage Research at Birmingham Women's Hospital a charity that helps people who have experienced miscarriage and stillbirth - meanwhile she has had yet another miscarriage in October 2018.
Danielle and Ed had their first appointment in December 2018 and after several tests, scans and participation in trial research, they were prescribed progesterone and Danielle got pregnant- unfortunately it resulted in the fifth miscarriage in February 2019.
A few months later after more scans, progesterone from a positive ovulation test was what actually worked.
Progesterone is a hormone that is secreted by the corpus luteum, a temporary endocrine gland that the female body produces after ovulation.
It prepares the body for the possibility of pregnancy after ovulation. 
It causes a thickening of the uterus lining to allow for an egg to embed into the wall. 
After a woman's cycle is completed and they are not pregnant the gland breaks down and the menstrual cycle begins. 
If a woman does become pregnant the chemical continues to be produced to maintain the layer and provide oxygen to the developing fetus.  
Said to be 'oestrogen's cousin' or the 'relaxing hormone', is thought to help to maintain pregnancy.
It is not typically prescribed on the NHS in the UK unless a woman has three or more miscarriages in a row.
If progesterone levels are too low with regard to estrogen levels, a woman will experience sleep disturbances, irritability, anxiety, weight gain, breast swelling, breast tenderness, and itching, bloating, sweating, loss of memory, and loss of libido. 
Despite its widespread use in pregnancy the hormone has also been shown to promote nerve, blood vessel, and bone tissue repair. 
This has therefore brought around applications in tissue regeneration.  
The couple was hesitant to believe they were going to become parents after a positive pregnancy test in July 2019.
Danielle added: 'Dr Craciunas was amazing, he was determined to find out what was going on with me and he did.
'The first weekend in July, Ed and I had a wonderful mini break in London of which Ed proposed and for a while everything else that had been going on didn't matter, we were in our own little bubble.
'That bubble was popped when I got a positive pregnancy test a few days later We were just waiting for bad news again.'
She said: 'We were past being excited when we saw those two lines, all we now felt was heartache of what could happen again' 
'When we went for a scan and we heard a heartbeat, we knew she was there.'
She explained: 'I started feeling more calm after the 20 week scan when we found out she is a girl. When I got to 35 weeks I think it hit me, it was finally happening.'   
But amazingly, little Georgia entered the world on March 16, weighing 7lb 10oz.
Danielle said: 'The overwhelming feeling of love when she was placed on my chest is something I simply cannot describe, it's a feeling like no other.
Danielle continued: 'It's something I never knew if I would get to experience. It was quite nerve-wrecking because when I got to six weeks I was expecting something to go wrong.
'And even my family couldn't get excited anymore because of all the miscarriages before.
'It's a horrible feeling when you take a pregnancy test and as much as you want a baby, are dreading what's coming because you end up thinking it might happen again - the paranoia never leaves you.
'We are just so happy that we finally have our little family.'
Three days later, Danielle and Ed welcomed their new baby home to join their family. 
Danielle said: 'I can't describe the feeling when I saw her for the first time, I had this overwhelming feeling of love.
'I was so proud of myself especially after everything we've been through.' 
'Taking her home was amazing, putting her in the car seat just didn't seem real, I was so happy.
'She is doing great now, she is very sassy and clingy but I don't mind because that means I get more cuddles.
'She is over 9 lbs now, she loves her food.'
She added: 'My advice to other couples struggling would be to make sure you speak about it and don't give up hope- there is always someone who will help you, I was lucky to find that someone.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rosanna Davison explains why she shields her baby Sophia's face on social media</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rosanna Davison has opened up on her decision to shield her baby’s face from the world saying it’s not her right to show Sophia online.
The 36-year old former Miss World and her husband Wes Quirke welcomed baby Sophia in November via surrogate.
The couple helped couples struggling to conceive across the nation by sharing their heartfelt story on their journey to parenthood on social media.
Rosanna opened up on how multiple failed attempts to conceive ended in happiness as they welcomed their miracle baby last year.
The couple made the decision early on to protect baby Sophia’s identity online.
Rosanna told the Irish Mirror: “We knew a long time before she was born that we wouldn’t show her face online, primarily for her safety and privacy and because we feel that it’s not our right to put her face online until she’s old enough to decide for herself.
“Each to their own. But she’s super cute, so we bombard our family WhatsApp group chats with her photos and videos instead!”
The model turned nutritionist said to help with the crisis she’s sharing as many immune boosting recipes on her website, but with motherhood taking over, her time is no longer her own.
She said: I’m sharing tips and recipes on social media for immune-boosting foods and I regularly share my smoothie recipes.
“I always think I’ll have more time for that but having a small baby is incredibly demanding on your time as any parent knows!”
She advised that our lifestyle choices are of paramount importance when it comes to boosting our immunity.
She said: “Our lifestyle choices, from food to sleep and physical activity, can all have a positive influence on our immune system health.”
The stunner told how this month was to mark her first family holiday with baby Sophia but the pandemic put a stop to that.
She explained: “We had a trip to Ibiza booked for the first half of May.
“It would have been our first family holiday with Sophia and we had planned to go to a quiet family resort.
“I just can’t imagine this crisis disappearing for another few months at the least. However, we’re all in this together and need to work as a team and look after each other.”
Rosanna’s international work has also been cancelled she added: “ I had a work trip to Germany next week cancelled, and understandably so.
“But yes, I’m so grateful to be home and safe with my little family.
“I love my work trips abroad and I’m back to work with TanOrganic, a brand I adore, but it’s been lovely to spend so much time at home with Sophia since she’s been born.
“Being a mum is the best job in the world!”
Rosanna recommends a simple ginger cinnamon and apple porridge to boost immunity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joe Wicks 'feeling fantastic' after operation and vows he's 'back in the game'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Wicks has admitted he’s feeling ‘fantastic’ after having surgery on his hand and shared an update from his hospital bed.
The Body Coach had been admitted to Kingston Hospital in London over a painful injury and underwent an operation to repair it after falling off a bike, but he’s now fighting fit and rearing to get back to keeping the globe healthy during coronavirus lockdown.
‘Good morning everybody, I feel fantastic,’ Joe said in a video posted on his Instagram Stories.
‘The antibiotics have well and truly kicked in. The inflammation and the swelling has gone right down.’
He then wiggled his fingers and joked he might now write some emails and play the guitar.
‘I’m back in the game so see you Monday morning for some nose-picking,’ Joe added.
Joe revealed that he will be returning to his PE session next week, with the 33-year-old previously telling his followers: ‘See you Monday for PE with Joe.’
He also explained that his wife, Rosie, will be helping him for the upcoming session, as he might not be able to showcase many exercises due to his injury, but he ‘doesn’t want to let anyone down’.
‘I’ve just asked my lovely wife Rosie to help me with #pewithjoe on Monday morning and she’s kindly agreed,’ he said, as he posted a picture of Rosie with their son, Marley, to his story.
‘It’s well out of her comfort zone but she’s my best friend and she knows how much this means to me.
‘I don’t want to let anyone down but I don’t think I’m going to be able to demo many exercises so I’ll be having Rosie on camera with me.
‘I’ll still lead the session and coach you through it. I’ll just have Rosie demonstrating the moves.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joe Wicks reveals he's been hospitalised as he releases heartfelt message to fans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For weeks, Joe Wicks has kept the nation exercised and entertained with his live fitness classes during lockdown.
The health and fitness guru has become a national treasure thanks to his dedication and positive attitude, and it's safe to say that we're all thankful for it. But things have been put on hold for a bit, with Joe revealing that he is currently in hospital awaiting surgery.
The 33-year-old Body Coach took to Instagram to tell his 3.4 million followers that he had admitted himself into hospital on Friday after a previous hand injury became inflamed, The Mirror reports.
Joe initially fractured his hand at the end of March after falling off his bike and has already had one operation on the injury.
Despite making progress in his recovery in the last few weeks, the YouTube star said he woke up on Friday and his hand was throbbing "like liquid hot magma".
He said to fans: "Great news. Bones have healed. Wires haven’t broke but the soft tissue is inflamed and possibly infected. They are operating today and removing the wires. They’ve given me some strong painkillers which have taken the edge off it."
However, medical staff at Kingston Hospital were unable to take Joe into surgery immediately because other patients were waiting, so the fitness guru spent Friday night in a hospital bed ahead of the minor procedure scheduled for Saturday.
Wearing a hospital gown in the majority of his social media stories, Joe was put on an IV drip to ease the pain.
Later on Friday evening, Joe spoke from his hospital bed about how thankful he was for the NHS and shared a number of kind messages from well wishers.
"I'm feeling super grateful for this healthcare system we've got, and there's people of all nationalities coming in here and taking care of me."
In the heartfelt message, the health guru explained that he was in safe hands thanks to the incredible staff at Kingston hospital.
"It doesn't matter how old you are, when you see a nurse or a doctor you instantly feel safe , calm and relaxed."
In his final posts of the evening, the health and fitness coach explained that his thoughts were with the country's front line staff and healthcare workers.
"Lots of love to anyone out there who are NHS staff," he added.
Joe is yet to update social media followers on how today's minor procedure went.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Wicks was due to undergo surgery today after ending up back in hospital following an accident on his bike.
The Body Coach star, whose YouTube fitness sessions have attracted millions of viewers during the lockdown, initially fractured his hand in the accident back in March.
He has already had one operation on the hand, but the 33-year-old admitted himself to hospital for a second time on Friday after suffering from pain and swelling, The Mirror reports.
He told his followers online it felt like his hand was throbbing "like liquid hot magma".
The 33-year-old, dubbed 'the Nation's PE Teacher' also posted an x-ray image of his hand which showed a number of wires.
"Great news," he said online. "Bones have healed. Wires haven’t broke but the soft tissue is inflamed and possibly infected.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joe Wicks in hospital on a drip fighting infection after hand injury</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Wicks, the nation's PE teacher, is in hospital on a drip fighting off an infection.
The Body Coach star, who has become a lockdown hero thanks to his daily PE lessons on YouTube, is slated to have an operation today.
He had previously injured his hand after falling off his bike and updated fans yesterday, saying: "Great news. Bones have healed.
"Wires haven’t broken but the soft tissue is inflamed and possibly infected. They are operating today and removing the wires. They’ve given me some strong painkillers which have taken the edge off it."
However, speaking from his hospital bed later, the 33-year-old told his social media followers: "They aren't able to do the operation today, they have other patients in the queue.
"They are a bit slower with certain things so I'm staying tonight.
"They're going to give me some nice morphine, and some antibiotics on the drip-a-roo. In the morning, hopefully first thing, I'll be having the wires taken out."
He added later: "I tell you what, this infection is no joke. I've had codeine up to my eyeballs. They gave me liquid morphine, but it ain't taking the edge off it. It's throbbing."
He added: "I've got a drip of liquid paracetamol. That is absolutely fantastic. Paracetamol IV saves the day for now, almost instant effect and on the pain.
"So glad I'm staying here tonight. I woke up all night last night as it was throbbing and pulsating like liquid hot magma.
"Thanks for all your well wishes. Gonna get a good night's sleep I think."
The dad of two had minor surgery for his injured hand in March and had recently been wearing his arm in a bandage.
He continued his online fitness classes, raising money for the NHS, but he hasn't been able to do push-ups.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Wicks has been admitted to hospital over his painful hand injury, with the Body Coach star set to undergo an operation.
The YouTuber, who’s been keeping fans fit and active with his daily PE classes, fractured his hand a few weeks ago after falling off a bike.
Updating viewers on his Instagram Stories, he explained: ‘Great news. Bones have healed.
‘Wires haven’t broke but the soft tissue is inflamed and possibly infected. They are operating today and removing the wires. They’ve given me some strong painkillers which have taken the edge off it’.

‘They gave me liquid morphine, it ain’t taking the edge off it. It’s throbbing,’ he added, before declaring himself: ‘Throbbington Crusoe.’
He added: ‘So glad I’m staying here tonight. I woke up all night last night as it was throbbing and pulsating like liquid hot magma. Thanks for all your well wishes. Gonna get a good night’s sleep I think.’
Nevertheless, the fitness star kept positive and thankful, adding before he went to sleep: ‘I’m just having a bit of a moment really, where I’m feeling super grateful for this healthcare system we’ve got, and these people that are coming in.
‘There’s people from all different nationalities, coming in here, taking care of me, nurturing me.’
‘Lots of love to anyone out there that’s NHS staff in any hospital, anywhere in the country,’ he continued.
Joe has been raising money for the NHS with his workout videos, donating all the ad revenue to charity. So far, he’s raised more than £91,000 as thousands around the world tune into his videos every day.
‘Thank you so much for taking part and helping raise all this money for a cause which I feel we can all be proud of,’ he told fans. ‘The great news is we can grow this number even bigger each week by coming back and tuning in again.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joe Wicks gives updates on hand injury from hospital</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Wicks has been in hospital after injuring his hand.
The Body Coach, 33, showed fans an X-ray before the procedure, saying he would be operated on because the soft tissue in his hand is “inflamed and possibly infected”.
He previously told followers of his hit PE workouts that he broke a bone in his hand after falling off his bike.
Wicks, who is donating the money raised from his online PE lessons to the NHS, posted a video of himself “gowned up” with “the socks on” and waiting for his operation.
He later said, from his hospital bed, that the operation had been delayed.
“They aren’t able to do the operation today,” the star said. “They’ve got other patients in the queue and they’re a bit slower than normal with certain things.”
Wicks said the pain from the “infection” was excruciating, adding: “I woke up all night… as it was throbbing and pulsating like liquid hot magma.
“Thanks for all your well-wishes. Gonna get a good night’s sleep I think.”
Wicks told fans that “Paracetamol IV” had “saved the day for now, almost instant effect on the pain….
“So glad I’m staying here tonight,” he said, adding he was feeling “super grateful” for the NHS.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Phillip Schofield has taken to Instagram to show off his wildly different lockdown hair choices.
In one picture he showed off slick back and styled hairdoo, while in another his silver hair was sticking up and unkempt.
The TV personality wore a smart polo shirt in the black and white pic of his slick look while in the other he grimaced as his mop spiked in all directions.
And fans of the presenter who wrote with his snap: "Lockdown hair options" had mixed opinions about his wacky hair styles.
One wrote: "The second wild look!!."
Another said: "Silver fox, followed by two flame emojis."
A fan wrote: "Wow Phillip! Rocking them hair styles."
Another added: "I like the nutty professor look!"
While other fans were not as impressed with Phillip's lockdown hair choices.
One wrote: "Cut it all offfffffff."
Another said: "How many likes on this comment for you to shave it all off."
The This Morning host also posted his smart hair style on his Instagram stories, captioning it: "If ya can't cut it, slick it."
Philtook to his Instagram earlier this week to share the same snap of is unkempt hair.
In the pic Phil appeared to be sitting in a balcony area on on a plush grey sofa in his new place.
The pic was taken from his new bachelor pad where he moved to after moving out of the home he shared with his wife Steph when he came out as gay earlier this year.
Phillip admitted that he 'misses hugs' after moving out of the £2million family home on Monday's episode of This Morning.
He also this week opened up on how This Morning going ahead amid the coronavirus lockdown allowed him to keep positive mentally.
He said: "It's very good for the head isn't it. I think this has saved my head actually, being able to come in here and keep going."
Later on in the show, Phillip shared important advice as he encouraged one tearful viewer to remain positive during the unusual situation of lockdown.
He said: "You've got to think positive, it's a time where we are all trying to find a silver lining in what is a very dark cloud... we will all get through this."=

    <h5 class="mb-1">Phillip Schofield has given up on lockdown routine as he shows off unruly hair</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Phillip Schofield has given up on his usual styling routines like the rest of us and showed off his new hair.
The This Morning host debuted his unruly mane, looking rather similar to Dr. Emmett ‘Doc’ Brown from Back To The Future.
Sharing a side-by-side picture to his Instagram, the 58-year-old captioned the post: ‘Lockdown hair options.’
One of the photos had Phillip slick his hair back with gel and all he’s missing is a tuxedo.
Of course, the snap had to be black and white to add to the suave effect.
Fans found the two styles hilarious, leaving jokes under his post.
One fan made the perfect comparison, stating: ‘Is that like Tom Hardy vs Boris Johnson.’
However, some weren’t too appreciative of the slicked back look, writing: ‘Deffo the second look!😂😂’
Or maybe this comparison is more accurate: ‘Richard Gere V Freddie Boswell 🤣 ❤️ u Phil.’
The talk show host has been isolating in his new flat, after being spotted moving out of his £2 million family home after coming out as gay.
However, Phillip and Holly Willoughby continue filming This Morning from the studio.
And ITV boss Kevin Lygo has plans in place if the coronavirus pandemic ever forces the show out of ITV studios.
Holly and Phil have been equipped with expensive cameras in their respective homes so they can continue filming the day time TV show as normal.
Lygo said: ‘When it looked that lockdown was coming, I quickly went into what are our priorities here, what are the main things ITV should be doing?
‘I prioritised quite early the news and the regional news, we have to keep them on air, they must continue broadcasting for a long as possible.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Little did Emilia Memory know what was to come when she placed a yellow house on the edge of an iceberg.
How her final year of secondary school would turn out. That her resulting artwork would end up being shown by Brisbane's Gallery of Modern Art. And that the piece would be shown virtually, as the world was plunged into a new unknown - brought about by the coronavirus pandemic.
Ms Memory became one of 33 Queensland senior high school recipients of the annual Creative Generation Excellence Awards in visual art.
The Lourdes Hill College graduate said she had no intention of her artwork going “anywhere” until her teacher nominated the piece.
“I drew my first sketch based on where my headspace was at, at the time,” she said.
“It's so surreal. I never would've thought I'd be someone to get into GOMA.”
Ms Memory took the sketch-turned-installation a step further and photographed the work.
She drew inspiration from artist James Casebere and architect Ricardo Bofill as well as National Geographic photographs.
“At some point in a person’s life, they will confront places, people, things or situations that are foreign to them,” she said.
“It could be moving to a new house, starting a new job or changing schools.”
Ms Memory said uncertainty and fear crept in at the time of creation because she was beginning her first term in her final year of schooling.
“It’s crazy that we’re talking about the theme of the unknown, where we are now, living during the pandemic,” she said.
“What I learnt in my final year was that everything will work itself out.”
Ms Memory is now studying a nursing diploma but continues to create art during her spare time.
“I really want to get into fashion someday and somehow,” she said.
“I honestly feel blessed and this exhibition is such a great opportunity that I hope it can open new avenues for me as well.”

She drew inspiration from artist James Casebere and architect Ricardo Bofill as well as National Geographic photographs.
“At some point in a person’s life, they will confront places, people, things or situations that are foreign to them,” she said.
“It could be moving to a new house, starting a new job or changing schools.”
Ms Memory said uncertainty and fear crept in at the time of creation because she was beginning her first term in her final year of schooling.
“It’s crazy that we’re talking about the theme of the unknown, where we are now, living during the pandemic,” she said.
“What I learnt in my final year was that everything will work itself out.”
Ms Memory is now studying a nursing diploma but continues to create art during her spare time.
“I really want to get into fashion someday and somehow,” she said.
“I honestly feel blessed and this exhibition is such a great opportunity that I hope it can open new avenues for me as well.”
View the exhibition here until July 26.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sam Lloyd, ‘Scrubs’ star, dies of brain tumour at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, an American actor renowned for his role as Ted Buckland in ‘Scrubs’, a comedy-drama television series, has died after battling a brain tumor.
In January last year, the 56-year-old singer was diagnosed with an inoperable tumor and cancer, which eventually spread to his lungs, jaw, liver, and spine.
Lloyd, however, breathed his last on Thursday, a year after Vanessa Lloyd, his wife, had given birth to their first child together.
“Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many,” Bill Lawrence, the creator of ‘Scrubs’, said while confirming his death on Friday.
“Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with,” Zach Braff, another US actor, who also played a role in ‘Scrubs’, wrote while paying tributes to the late actor.
“Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy.”
Lloyd is also known for his roles in a slew of TV shows including ‘Desperate Housewives’, ‘Happy Together’, ‘Shameless’, ‘The West Wing’, and ‘Modern Family’.
He also had guest spots on ‘Spin City’ and ‘Seinfeld’ and notable credits in films like ‘Galaxy Quest’ and “Flubber’. The late actor is survived by his wife and a child.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scrubs stars pay tribute to Sam Lloyd, aka Ted Buckland, as he dies aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scrubs stars have been paying tribute to Sam Lloyd, after the actor died aged 56.
Lloyd, best known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland on the hospital comedy, passed away on 30 April.
While his cause of death has yet to be confirmed, he had been battling cancer, having been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour at the beginning of 2019.
He was then diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer, which had spread to his liver, spine and jaw bone.
Following the sad news, Sam’s Scrubs castmates shared tributes on social media, including Zach Braff, who played JD on the show.
The 45-year-old tweeted: ‘Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. 
‘He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy.’
Zach went on to share a clip of Sam singing Somewhere Over The Rainbow with his a capella group The Blanks, who made recurring appearances on Scrubs, as well as pictures of some of Lloyd’s most memorable scenes.
Sarah Chalke, who played Elliot Reid, tweeted: ‘Oh Sam…I feel so lucky I got the chance to know and work with you. You were the the kindest, funniest man. Sending so much love to your family. Rest In Peace.’
Series creator Bill Lawrence posted a BTS picture from the show and wrote: ‘Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many.’
He added: ‘Spent the night watching clips of Sam (The songs! The greatest sweaty pratfall of all time!) Those who reached out, our “Scrubs family” appreciates it – he had the biggest heart of all of us. 
‘But now send all those good thoughts to his family. And to your own loved ones. #RIPTed.’
Actress Kate Micucci played Ted’s girlfriend Stephanie Gooch on the show, and posted a picture with Sam to Twitter.
‘So sad to hear the news about Sam Lloyd,’ she tweeted.
‘Sam was one of the warmest, funniest and most generous actors I’ve ever worked with. I loved getting to sing with him and it was an honor to play his girlfriend on Scrubs. He will be so missed.’
Robert Maschio, who played The Todd on Scrubs, tweeted a selfie with Sam and wrote: ‘Simpler times, happier days, the kindest man I ever met. Easy going Sam, Rest In Peace.’
Meanwhile, other actors who had worked with Sam on different shows also shared their condolences.
The Masked Singer judge Ken Jeong tweeted: ‘I was just talking about Sam Lloyd and how amazing he was when he appeared on @DrKenABC. Oh man, this hurts. It was a true honor working with you. A genius and a gentleman. Rest In Peace.’
While Lloyd was best known for his role as miserable lawyer Ted, he also starred on shows including Seinfeld, The West Wing and Desperate Housewives, and reprised his role of Ted Buckland in Cougar Town. 
Lloyd is survived by his wife Vanessa and their son Weston.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zach Braff leads tributes to Scrubs co-star Sam Lloyd following his death aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tributes have been paid to actor Sam Lloyd, who was best known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland on medical comedy Scrubs, following his death at the age of 56.
In January 2019,  the actor informed fans he had been diagnosed with cancer of the brain and lungs.
Sam announced the news about his health just a month after welcoming a son named Weston with his wife, Vanessa.
Sam’s co-stars from the popular comedy series took to social media to pay heartfelt tributes to him after the tragic news of his death broke yesterday.
Zach Braff, who played John ‘JD’ Dorian in Scrubs, wrote on Twitter: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I've ever had the joy of working with.
“Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together.”
He added: "He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Bill Lawrence, creator of Scrubs, tweeted: "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."
Sam’s co-star Robert Maschio penned: “Simpler times, happier days, the kindest man I ever met.
“Easy going Sam, Rest In Peace. #RIPSamLloyd.”
After Sam was diagnosed with cancer, the cast and crew of Scrubs supported him by launching a GoFundMe page to help him in his fight against the disease.
The page was updated in March to share news about Sam celebrating his young son’s first birthday.
The post, updated by Scrubs writer Tim Hobert, read: "In the 13 months since Sam’s original diagnosis, with help from you guys (incredible people from all over the world), he has made the most of the time that he has been given.
"He was able to go back to his home state of Vermont and play his annual gig with his Beatles band, The Butties.
"He was able to do guest spots on Modern Family and American Housewife that allowed him to qualify for the Screen Actors Guild insurance policy.”
The post continued: “He was able to spend time with dear friends, help his mother in the last stages of her life, and sing for her at her funeral, and most importantly, he was able to spend time with his wife, Vanessa, and celebrate Weston’s first birthday!"
The GoFundMe page raised over $150,000 towards the actor's medical bills.
Sam had begun to suffer headaches and after losing 10lbs and with the headaches continuing, he decided to get a CT scan.
The scan revealed a mass on his brain and he was taken in to have brain surgery, but the tumour was unfortunately too intertwined, so the surgeons couldn’t remove it.
Sam and his wife were then told by doctors that the cancer in his brain had metastasized from his lungs. Further scans showed the cancer was also in his liver, spine, and jaw.
Sam, who was the nephew of Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd, played Ted Buckland in 95 episodes of Scrubs.
Alongside his acting career, he was a talented singer and performed with the A cappella group The Blanks.
Sam also had roles in Cougar Town, Desperate Housewives, and appeared as the character Ricky on Seinfeld.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Scrubs' actor Sam Lloyd has died</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, best known as sad-sack lawyer Ted Buckland on Scrubs, died Friday. He was 56.
The actor had been diagnosed with lung cancer in January 2019, per Entertainment Weekly, only weeks after his wife, Vanessa, gave birth to their first child. At the time, doctors discovered an inoperable tumor in his brain. 
Lloyd, who is the nephew of Back to the Future star Christopher Lloyd, had screen career spanning three decades. He jumped between TV and film, in projects as wide-ranging as Flubber, Galaxy Quest, Seinfeld, The West Wing, and Desperate Housewives. 
In addition to his work as an actor, Lloyd was an accomplished musician with the a cappella group The Blanks (which Scrubs fans might recognize as The Worthless Peons) and the Beatles cover band The Butties.
But Lloyd was probably most recognizable as Ted on Scrubs, appearing in all nine seasons and even reprising the role for a guest arc in Cougar Town. 
Some of Lloyd's former colleagues paid tribute to him on social media, including Scrubs star Zach Braff and Scrubs and Cougar Town creator Bill Lawrence.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scrubs Actor Sam Lloyd Has Died Aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Sam Lloyd has died aged 56.
Lloyd is most well-known for playing hospital lawyer Ted Buckland in Scrubs. He appeared in 95 episodes of the series which ran from 2001 - 2009.
A career which began in the late 80s also saw him make appearances in Seinfeld, Mad About You, The West Wing, 3rd Rock From The Sun, Spin City, Desperate Housewives, Modern Family and Galaxy Quest.
He was also a member of a capella group The Blanks which appeared on Scrubs.
Entertainment Weekley reported that Llyod had been diagnosed with cancer in January 2019 when doctors discovered an inoperable brain tumour.
Actor Zach Braff, who was one of the main stars of Scrubs, paid tribute to Lloyd.
"Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with," Braff said on Twitter.
"Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence also paid tribute.
"Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today," he said.
"Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many.
"Spent the night watching clips of Sam (The songs! The greatest sweaty pratfall of all time!) Those who reached out, our “Scrubs family” appreciates it - he had the biggest heart of all of us. But now send all those good thoughts to his family. And to your own loved ones."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WASHINGTON: American singer Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber have teamed up to help others in need during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Grande and Bieber announced on Friday(local time) that they are working on a song, 'Stuck With U,' which will drop next week with all proceeds slated to go to coronavirus relief.
The 26-year-old songstress Ariana tweeted on Friday, "Stuck with u by me and @justinbieber out May 8th. head to my Instagram for more info. thank u to @1strcf and @sb_projects for making this possible."
Grande also announced the news on Instagram, and wrote, "Grateful to announce that my friend and i have partnered with @1strcf and @sb_projects on this release. proceeds from the streams and sales of #stuckwithu will be donated to first responders children's foundation to fund grants and scholarships for children of healthcare workers, emergency medical technicians (EMTs), paramedics, police officers and firefighters serving at the front lines during the global pandemic."
The 26-year-old pop-star Bieber, also added in a statement, "More than ever we are seeing the selfless, tireless and amazing work that doctors, nurses and healthcare providers give to the world every day. It is our hope we can lend our voices to raise awareness and give much-needed support for them and their families. It's my honour to come together with my friend Ariana and our SB Projects family to try and do some good."
The two music superstars have also independently been helping people in need. According to sources to Page Six, Grande, who has been communicating her longing to make music during the quarantine, has sent fans between 500 and 1,000 USD using the Venmo app.
One of the Ariana fans told Page Six that the 'Senorita' singer "took care of my salary for the month." She has helped more than 20 fans, said the outlet.
The '7 rings' singer also joined the Disney family singalong in April and sang 'I Won't Say I'm In Love' the animated film 'Hercules.'
Back in February, Bieber cantered his efforts on China, saying at the time that he "couldn't imagine how scary it would be if a new disease was effecting my wife and my family and friends."
The 'Yummy' singer said he made a donation to the country and urged his followers to join in on the conversation.
Bieber also accepted the #AllInChallenge to raise money for COVID relief. The singer said he will fly to your house for a private concert and sing 'One Less Lonely Girl.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">You could be in the music video for Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber's new track</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber are teaming up for a new track, and they want fans to be a part of it.
Grande and Bieber made the announcement Friday, on their respective social media pages. The song, called "Stuck With U," is set to be released on May 8, with proceeds going to the First Responder Children's Foundation, to fund grants and scholarships for children of health care workers, EMTs, paramedics, police officers and firefighters on the frontlines, Grande said.
But wait, there's more.
Bieber and Grande went ahead and posted an instrumental version of the song, instructing their fans to tweet videos of themselves dancing to the track -- in the prom dresses or suits they didn't get to wear, with their dogs or just alone in whatever is comfy.
The fan videos will end up as a part of the music video for the track when it's released.
Grande and Bieber aren't the first artists to release new music during the pandemic, with proceeds going to frontline workers.
Internationally renowned Nigerian singer Davido released his new music video, "Dolce & Gabbana," last month, and announced all proceeds would go to the Dolce & Gabbana and Humanitas Together for Coronavirus Research fund.
U2 singer Bono also wrote a new song back in March, called "Let Your Love Be Known," dedicated to health care workers on the frontlines and anyone struggling.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Selena Gomez Looks Absolutely Gorgeous In Makeup-Free Selfie: ‘Today I’m Choosing Happiness’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While Selena Gomez remains in lockdown due to the coronavirus, she’s making sure to keep a positive attitude by leaving herself uplifting post-it notes on her mirror. Her cosmetics brand Rare Beauty posted an Instagram photo of their boss on May 1, nearly makeup free while taking a selfie. Selena is looking down at her phone and smiling in the pic, looking so gorgeous with her hair pulled back and wearing a casual black crew-neck sweater. It’s the message in the mirror that has her appearing so content. On a post-it with her cosmetic brand’s name at the top, it reads “I am in charge of how I feel today. I am choosing happiness.”
In the caption her brand posted, “Choose happiness. Every month is Mental Health Awareness Month – we’ll be sharing more resources, community stories and ways we stay positive all month long. Enjoy your weekend, log off and do something that makes you feel good. #mentalhealthawarenessmonth #rarereminder.” May 1 marks the beginning of Mental Health Awareness Month, and Selena has long been an advocate of taking care of one’s mental health, as well as erasing the stigma around it.
Selena, 27, has been open about her struggles with anxiety and depression. She made a new revelation to Miley Cyrus, 27, on the “Wrecking Ball” singer’s Apr. 3 Instagram Live show, BRIGHT MINDED: Live With Miley that she’s bipolar. “Recently, I went to one of the best hospitals in the world — or definitely in America — McLean [Hospital, in Massachusetts], and I discussed that after going through years of a lot of different things, I realized that I was bipolar,” Selena told Miley. “And so, when I know more information it actually helps me; it doesn’t scare me once I know it. And I think people get scared of that…I’m from Texas, where it’s not known to talk about your mental health. You’ve got to seem cool.”
Selena’s first connection to McLean was in Sept. 2019, when the Boston-area psychiatric hospital gave her an award at their annual dinner for her efforts to raise awareness about mental health. Selena posed with her award in a photo that she posted to her Instagram account and wrote next to it, “So humbled to have been part of the incredible McLean Hospital’s Annual Dinner and was honored to be able to share a bit of my story. Thank you Dr. Rauch for inviting me and spending time speaking with me about mental health. And thank you to all the amazing staff at McLean. And a huge thank you to (film director) David O. Russell for connecting me with these amazing humans. These are the moments where I am so grateful for the platform God has given me.” It turns out the connection was a tight one, as Selena returned and was able to work with McLean’s doctors to realize that she was dealing with bipolar disorder.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1, 2020
Sarah Batool Haider
Instagram model Eden Levine recently took to her account and wowed her fans with a very sexy, lingerie snapshot.
In the pic, which was uploaded to the photo-sharing website on Friday, May 1, Eden could be seen rocking sexy silk lingerie that allowed her to show off a lot of skin. To strike a pose for the pic, she lied on her bed over her belly and flashed major sideboob to tease her fans. That’s not all, but the picture also captured an eyeful of her pert booty.
Staying true to her signature style, she sported a full face of makeup. The application featured foundation, a pink lipstick combined with a slick of gloss, nude eyeshadow, heavily lined eyes, and a thick coat of mascara. Eden dusted her cheeks with a pink blush and highlighter, while she finished off her makeup application with dark, well-defined eyebrows. She wore her raven-colored tresses in soft curls and swept them to one side.
In the caption, Eden shared an incident with her fans, telling them that she burned herself while curling her hair with an iron rod. She also asked her followers to watch her latest Instagram Stories where she shared screenshots of how people troll her and other models on social media.
Within eight hours of going live, the snap garnered more than 8,700 likes. Some of her fans also flocked to the comments section and posted above 220 comments in which they praised Eden for her sexiness. Not only that, but many users also extended their support because she has to face a lot of trolling on a daily basis.
“I love you, sweetheart! You are outstandingly beautiful, gorgeous, and nice,” one of her fans commented on the snap.
“Wow, so beautiful. Happy Friday, I hope you have a great weekend,” another user chimed in.
“Sorry, darling. You have to deal with trolls. You are beautiful, confident, and brave! Keep it up!” a third admirer remarked.
Meanwhile, a fourth follower asked Eden to marry him.
“How can someone be this gorgeous and perfect? Will you be my wife?” they wrote.
Other users posted words and phrases like “goddess,” “very, very pretty,” and “I love you,” to express their admiration for the model.
Aside from her regular followers, many of Eden’s fellow models and influencers also liked and commented on the snap to show appreciation, including Pandora Blue, Viviana Castrillon, Gia Macool, and Rachel Ann Cook.
Eden likes to show off her feminine curves in a variety of revealing outfits. Not too long ago, she gave her fans an eyeful of cleavage in a photo that featured her wearing a stunning red dress.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While social media has its own perks, it has some disadvantages too, and who better than celebrities know it! We see quite often fans commenting about celebs’ personal life and create a whole scene out of it and one such instance was witnessed with actress Eva Mendes, as one user questioned the Ryan Gosling’s parenting.
On Thursday, Eva Mendes shared a picture on Instagram with a caption that reads, “Tired Mama. Stayed up laaate trying to make my baby’s 4th birthday extra special since she won’t see the family. Here’s to all you having a quarantine birthday …sending extra love. Here’s to all you tired mamas…sending extra love.”
One of her fans commented, “Hi Eva, hope you will answer to my question. I really love you, really I do, but yesterday under your latest I saw that someone had thought what sometimes I thought about your post. I mean sometimes you seem a struggle single mother and we know that you have a man, but the way you write, I mean, seems that your husband let the hard job to you and he doesn’t help you.”
Without ignoring the comment, Eva Mendes was quick to reply and her answer literally won our hearts. She wrote, “I love women. I’m a girls’ girl. I love connecting to women. That’s mainly why I have this page. So when I say I’m a ‘tired mama’ and want to connect to other ‘tired mamas’ it’s not about excluding the fathers or other caregivers that do so much. It’s just me connecting to other women but in no way does it de-value what papas do.”
“And why I don’t talk about Ryan and all the wonderful things he does as a father is because I keep that part private. I don’t want to involve him or how he parents because I don’t feel comfortable crossing that boundary that I have set for myself,” she continued.
“I feel it’s best that I continue to disclose what I’m comfortable with but not involve him or my kids too much. It’s not about being cagey or weird, it’s just about staying private in a public space. Does that make sense? Hope so. Because this is my honest answer and I really do love connecting to you women,” she concluded.
What’s your thought on Eva Mendes’ reply?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Christopher Meloni Will Return To ‘Law & Order: SVU’ For The Season 22 Premiere</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Joe Allen
The actor left the show after its 12th season.
Elliot Stabler is making his return. On a behind-the-scenes podcast, Law & Order: SVU showrunner Warren Leight said that Christopher Meloni will be making his return to the show in the season 22 premiere. Meloni was a member of the show’s original cast, but left the show after 12 seasons. He played Elliot Stabler, the partner of Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson.
“It’s pretty clear that Elliot will be in the SVU season opener. I think that much I know,” Leigh said of Meloni’s return to the show.
Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Leight said it’s not currently clear when the new show will start shooting. Meloni’s character was originally supposed to return at the end of season 21, but those plans were eventually scrapped after the coronavirus pandemic cut the season short. Stabler was also supposed to appear alongside his wife and son, but Leight is unsure whether that will still be the case moving forward.
“Whether we’ll get to see his family as well remains to be seen,” he said.
Stabler left the Special Victims Unit at the end of the show’s 12th season and retired, citing the emotional toll that the job had taken on him.
The news of Stabler’s return to the world of SVU shouldn’t come as a shock. It follows the announcement that Meloni would be getting his own spin-off set in the world of the original show, but focused on his character.
The new drama is set to revolve around Stabler leading an organized crime unit in the NYPD. The show has been given an initial 13-episode order, but little else is known about what it will involve. Entertainment Weekly reports that Chicago P.D.‘s Matt Olmstead is currently being eyed as a potential showrunner for the new series.
Since leaving SVU roughly a decade ago, Meloni has picked up parts in a variety of other projects, largely on TV. He starred in the Syfy series Happy! and also had roles in shows like Underground and Maxxx, as well as a memorable guest arc on The Handmaid’s Tale.
Speculation has already begun as to what Meloni’s new series may be called. It’s possible that the show will be another in the Law & Order series, or it could decide to take its branding in a new direction. Much like the show it has been spun-off from, there is no set premiere date for the new project, in large part because of the COVID-19 crisis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Christopher Meloni Returning to 'Law & Order: SVU' in Season 22 Premiere Ahead of New Spinoff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Christopher Meloni will be reprising his role as Elliot Stabler on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit ahead of the upcoming spinoff centered around his character created by longtime producer Dick Wolf. While fans were thrilled last month to learn Meloni would be returning to the Law & Order universe, many wondered if and when he would be reunited with Mariska Hargitay’s Olivia Benson on SVU.
On the latest episode of The Law & Order: SVU Podcast, showrunner Warren Leight revealed that Stabler will be back on their screens sooner rather than later, with his first appearance on the SVU Season 22 premiere. “It’s pretty clear that Elliot will be in the SVU season opener,” Leight said, as per Entertainment Tonight. “I think that much I know. Whether we get to see his family as well remains to be seen.”
The original plan for Leight and other writers Julie Martin, Denis Hamill and Monet Hurst-Mendoza was to bring Stabler back with his family gradually. Leight said, "We had heard distant thunder about Chris Meloni coming back in the fall and we were going to lay a little groundwork for that. We were going to see [wife] Kathy Stabler come back very upset. Her son had been rolled by a team of ne'er-do-wells and may have been drugged, and we were going to revisit [Benson’s half-brother] Simon's seeming overdose and we were going to get to know the stresses on the Stablers — what had happened to the Stabler family after Elliot both left SVU and apparently left them."
But when Season 21 came to an early end due to the production shutdown caused by coronavirus, plans changed. "We were just going to lay some groundwork down in anticipation of Elliot's return of course in his own series. We had the sense that the first episode of next year for SVU was going to bring Elliot back, so we were going to foreshadow that and explain a little more what happened to Simon," Leight explained.
News of the spinoff first broke in March, with few details revealed at the time other than that Meloni would return to his role as Stabler again in a new series following his returns to the NYPD to head the Organized Crime Division. Martin said that with "a 10-year gap of no reference point whatsoever," there's a lot of background to fill in with where Stabler has been and how he has grown, but that it provides plenty of opportunity for crossover with his former partner in SVU as they move forward.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Christopher Meloni to return to ‘Law and Order: SVU’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Christopher Meloni, known for his role as Elliot Stabler, will return to Dick Wolf’s Law and Order SVU for its 22nd season, according to showrunner Warren Leight.
Leight confirmed on the SVU podcast on Wednesday that Stabler will at the least appear in the season opener.
“It’s pretty clear that Elliot will be in the SVU season opener. I think that much I know.”
The news of Christopher Meloni’s return comes a month after it was announced that his character would be getting his own show about leading his own crime unit.
No air date has been announced as of yet.
After starring alongside Mariska Hargitay, who plays Elliot’s former partner Olivia Benson, Meloni left the SVU squad following season 12.
Stabler went into retirement, citing the emotional toll of the job.
Leight also said that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear when filming of the 22nd season will begin.
It is still unclear if the entire Stabler family will be in the new season’s opening episode.
“Whether we’ll get to see his family as well remains to be seen,” says Leight.
Stabler and his family were slated to appear at the end of the show’s 21st season, however, this idea was eventually cut when the pandemic curtailed shooting.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Wicks says he will be back for his PE class on Monday after having surgery on his hand.
The Body Coach, 33, has been updating fans with his progress while in hospital after falling off his bike.
He said the surgery is over and paid tribute to the NHS.
“The wires have been taken out…. it was infected,” he said in a video on Instagram Stories.
“I’m staying in tonight to have…  antibiotics and a bit more paracetamol then I’ll be home tomorrow morning, back to my family.
“So see you Monday morning, PE With Joe.”
Earlier, Wicks, who is donating the money raised from his online PE lessons to the NHS, posted a video of himself “gowned up” with “the socks on” and waiting for his operation.
He said the pain from the “infection” in his hand was “throbbing and pulsating like liquid hot magma”.
Wicks said he was “super grateful for the health system we’ve got” and “the NHS people who are out here still grafting”.
Wicks also said his wife would help out on Monday.
“I’ve just asked my lovely wife Rosie to help me on Monday morning and she’s kindly agreed,” he said.
“It’s well out of her comfort zone but she’s my best friend and she knows how much this means to me.
“I don’t want to let anyone down but I don’t think I’m going to be able to demo many exercises so I’ll be having Rosie on camera with me.”
Wicks added: “I’ll still lead the session and coach you through it.
“I’ll just have Rosie demonstrating the moves.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Wicks says he will be back for his PE class on Monday after having surgery on his hand.
The Body Coach, 33, has been updating fans with his progress while in hospital after falling off his bike.
He said the surgery is over and paid tribute to the NHS.
“The wires have been taken out…. it was infected,” he said in a video on Instagram Stories.
“I’m staying in tonight to have…  antibiotics and a bit more paracetamol then I’ll be home tomorrow morning, back to my family.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rebel Wilson Unzips for Flirty Quarantine Photoshoot Following Dramatic Transformation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actress and comedian Rebel Wilson is thriving in quarantine, and we are in absolute awe! The 40-year-old actress took to Instagram on May 2 to share snapshots from her smoking at-home photoshoot, showing off a slimmed-down figure while sporting a light blue tracksuit. Flaunting her enviable, curvy figure while rocking an unzipped hoodie and exposing her black bra, Wilson captioned the carousel of snaps: "At Home With Rebel" alongside a kissy emoji. The photos have raked up more than half a million likes, and a plethora of comments.
In the first snap, Wilson channels her inner Victoria's Secret model, posing on top of her lush white sofa and smizing like a professional. In the following image, the Pitch Perfect actress stands defiantly in front of the camera, with her leg popped out with her fingers at the bottom of track suit jacket's zipper. In her last photo, Wilson channels her Cats role as she crawls toward the camera.
Fans chimed into the fiery shoot, expressing their enthusiasm over the shoot with a string of emojis including flames, heart eyes and kissy faces. "Woah.. well hello Rebel [eye emoji] your (sic) such a little Rebel.. [heart eyes emoji] but when are u gonna tell us about what u was rehearsing the other day?" wrote one fan, as another added, "Work it girl!" Meanwhile another fan wrote, "Damnn Rebel Wilson !! Looking beautiful as always."
At the beginning of the year, Wilson wrote in an Instagram post that 2020 would be "The Year of Health," admitting it was time to put herself first. "I put on the athleisure and went out for a walk, deliberately hydrating on the couch right now and trying to avoid the sugar and junk food which is going to be hard after the holidays I've just had but I'm going to do it!" she wrote. "Who's with me in making some positive changes this year?"
According to Hollywood Life, Wilson's dramatic transformation is all thanks to trainer, Jono Castano Acero who told the outlet that he encourages clients to an "extra bit" of cardio every day to keep moving. "A little tip is to get a watch or use your phone to count steps and aim for 10 thousand steps a day," he said. "If you're on 9000 steps at 10pm, you have to get it done." The fitness trainer adds that while Wilson is "one of the sweetest souls" he's ever met, the pair oftentimes end up burning a major dose of calories from all their laughing together.
The actress has long been an advocate for plus-size women and launched her own fashion line in 2017 called Rebel Wilson X Angels, designed specifically for sizes 14 to 24.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner hints at sexy time with Travis Scott in seductive pose</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kylie Jenner has fans hearts racing as she hinted she may be enjoying more than co-parenting with baby daddy Travis Scott.
Posing up in a rather seductive manner, Kylie, 22, hinted she was hanging out with daughter Stormi and rapper dad Travis with the caption: "Trolls and chill?"
Young Stormi is known for obsession with the movie and franchise withe Travis surprising his daughter with a visit from a lifesize Poppy last Christmas.
Kylie lifts her over size sweatshirt in the snap, showing off her taut tum as she arches her back, revealed suspiciously new lockdown locks.
Fans rushed to comment on the snap which fast gathered more than five million likes.
One wrote: "Just get back together already! Stop teasing us."
Another gushed: "They are just the perfect couple!" While one fan simply wrote: "Is Kris Jenner gonna give Kylie a lockdown pregnancy?"
Kylie and Travis are spending the lockdown time at her new California pad with best pal Stassie Karanikolaou.
Kylie and Travis started dating following her split from Tyga in 2017 but broke up back in September.
However, it was recently rumoured that they got back together at the start of the year - and their decision to isolate together has fuelled the gossip.
A source told The Sun Online : "Kris doesn't want anyone jerking her daughters around - she's told Travis to put a ring on it and commit to a second baby.
“Kylie would never put down rules like that, but she's made no secret about wanting another baby and commitment from him.
“She really looks up to Kim and her marriage and big family with Kanye - it's her dream - so Kris is right - he needs to commit!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Halle Berry, 53, Strikes A Fierce Pose In A Sheer Lingerie Outfit During A ‘Fitting Flashback’ — Pic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Is Halle Berry, 53, capable of looking less than flawless, like ever? The Oscar winner once again broke the internet when a photo of her rocking a very sexy outfit was posted on Friday, May 1. Fashion stylist Lindsay Flores heated up Instagram when she shared a pic of Halle striking a super fierce pose in a sheer lingerie ensemble. She appeared to go makeup free for the snap with her gorgeous brown locks cascading down both sides of her shoulders. “Ahhhhh the simpler times…,” Lindsay wrote as the caption with the hashtag #fittingflashback, more than likely referring to how things were before the worldwide coronavirus pandemic hit. Naturally the comments section were filled with endless compliments for Halle as fans couldn’t get over how “smoking hot” she looked.
Halle has been one of those A-list stars that has been providing a great distraction for many of us who remain bored in self-isolation. She’s been doing this by uploading a variety of pics that highlight her ageless beauty to perfection. She, along with other actresses like Sarah Michelle Gellar, 44, and Niecy Nash, 50, excelled in the viral #pillowchallenge where people strap a pillow to their body with a belt as a cincher and nothing on underneath.
The mother-of-two also got candid about her love life during an Instagram Live session with Lena Waithe, 35, in mid-April amid romance rumors between her and DJ D-Nice. “I’ve been pretty alone, by myself, going on three years now – decidedly so,” she first revealed before adding, ” I’ve decided to take time [for myself]… I’m going to spend time with me. And it’s been so great that I might stay like this.”
She’s also been using her time in self-isolation to stay in tiptop shape. “I try to catch 10 minutes here and there with the goal of doing at least 30 total minutes of more formal exercise per day,” she explained during an interview with Women’s Health. “I piece together a bunch of little bursts of exercise (many of which I can use my full-body resistance loop and booty band for) to meet my 30-minutes-total goal. In the morning, I try to stretch and do a few rounds of abs moves, like sit-ups or planks, since I usually have some quiet time to myself while the kids eat breakfast.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joselyn Cano Flaunts Bodacious Derriere As She Poses On All Fours In Skimpy Aqua Bikini</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Jona Jaupi
American internet model Joselyn Cano sent fans into a frenzy once more on social media after she posted a racy image of of herself bikini-clad on Friday, May 1. The bombshell took to her Instagram account to share the post with her 11.5 million followers.
The 29-year-old beauty was photographed on the beach as the blue sky filled the background behind her. Joselyn took center stage as she posed on all fours in the sand while her backside was propped out, exuding a playful, yet sexy vibe. She sported a slight smile as she directed her gaze into the camera’s lens. Furthermore, her long raven locks did not appear to be styled as they cascaded over her right shoulder in slight natural-looking waves.
Per usual, Joselyn added some glamour to the image by sporting a full face of makeup that brought out her natural beauty, including foundation, bronzer, blush, sculpted eyebrows, eyeliner, mascara, a nude lipgloss, and eyeshadow. However, it was her killer curves that were mainly on show, as she displayed her figure in a skimpy two-piece bikini.
Joselyn’s bikini top, which was aquamarine in color, featured a mesh design that added an extra touch of sexiness to the look. It further featured versatile ties that Joselyn had tied around her back, creating a strapless look. The tiny bra left little to the imagination as it exposed an ample amount of cleavage.
The model paired the top with matching bikini bottoms that were equally as revealing as they featured a Brazilian-style thong cut. The tiny bottoms had no trouble flaunting Joselyn’s bodacious derriere. Meanwhile, the thong’s high-waisted side strings highlighted her curvaceous hips and drew attention to her slim core.
Joselyn finished the beachside look off with a matching aquamarine bandana that she tied around her hair, and a pair of long drop earrings.
The model did not include a geotag in the post, but engaged with her fans in the post’s caption, asking them what their favorite color is, before stating that hers was blue.
The very sexy image was received with a great deal of support from fans, garnering more than 155,000 likes since going live on Instagram. Thousands of fans also took to the comments section to shower Joselyn with praise on her killer curves, beauty, and her bikini.
“Light blue is so pretty on you,” one user commented.
“Pretty you,” a second admirer wrote.
“You look absolutely amazing,” a third user added.
“Love you in this bikini,” a fourth fan asserted.
Joselyn is no stranger to sharing sexy snapshots of herself on Instagram. Earlier in March, she stunned fans after she posted an image of herself rocking a revealing one-piece that flaunted an ample amount of cleavage, per The Inquisitr. The popular post garnered more than 222,000 likes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner drives fans wild with '3D booty' pose in strikingly curvy photos</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kylie Jenner drove fans wild with an end of week photo shoot in her new multimillion dollar mansion as she prepared to embrace the weekend in lockdown.
The 22-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star drew attention to her curves as she threw ambitious shapes while cosied up to a palm tree in her back yard.
Wearing an orange and white skirt and matching strapless, midriff baring top, Kylie won praise, approval and desire from her legions of followers as she posed in a way that drew attention to her derrière.
Taking to Instagram to upload the snaps, Kylie captioned the photographs with the simple statement: “happy Friday,” alongside an orange heart emoji.
Fans were left with their jaws dropping open – with many making comments about her impressive figure in the comments section with one typing: “Bombass” alongside fire emojis.
While many others were drawn to her posterior, with one fan commenting: “Call that a 3D booty cos one can see it from all dimensions.”
Another fan expressed concern about the exerted pose the reality star was pulling, warning: “you’re going to break your back.”
And a further fan expressed sheer disbelief, writing: I don’t even Recognize that girl who is it?”
Kylie was posing in the back garden of her new home which she recently snapped up for £29 million.
The seven bedroom, 14 bathroom, property boasts plenty of outdoor space – with a pool, tennis courts, and palm trees amid the impressive grounds.
Kylie's latest jaw dropping snaps come just days after fans accused her of photoshopping some of her images.
Some followers shared suspicions after an image of Kylie in her swimming pool displayed mismatched tiling - suggesting the image had been manipulated.
One commented: "Had time to screen the pic you now deleted you posted on your IG...what a fail #fail#photoshop#KylieJenner..."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meet 2020’s Newest Influencers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Influencers have had a rough couple of weeks, as consumers’ tastes have rapidly drifted away from the high-gloss, incredibly curated and aspirational Insta-lifestyle that only a month or two ago was a staple of online life in the U.S.
Last month, Instagram influencer Jack Morris posted what once would have been a standard-issue image: He and his girlfriend in swimsuits posed on the edge of an infinity-edge pool, cuddling an adorable dog, framed by a pink Bali sunset – modified for the times with an inspirational message:
“Lauren and I are trying to stay inside in our villa as much as possible and comply with social distancing,” he wrote. “It sucks, but if everyone does their part, the quicker this will be over!”
The response was not quite the rapturous enthusiasm from his 2.7 million homebound followers, who found themselves conspicuously lacking both infinity-edge pools and Balinese sunsets to comfort them through these difficult times. Some noted the post was “insensitive” and “tone-deaf,” while others comforted themselves with the more dry observation: “Things could be worse, mate.”
And losing the audience has had more than a cost to influencers’ esteem – it has also taken a big bite out of their bottom line, according to BBC reports.
“Ad and marketing spend has been either cut drastically or thrown out of the window,” said Khyara Ranaweera, digital director of The Lifestyle Agency, a firm specializing in luxury lifestyle PR and affiliate marketing through links on blogs and social media. “A lot of businesses’ first response was panic mode: They shut their doors and social accounts and stopped spending.”
And influencers are feeling the hit. Travel influencer Alex Outhwaite has seen income from her YouTube channel drop by 90 percent in the last eight weeks. Karen Beddow, who quit practicing law to run her family travel blog, Mini Travellers, has seen her monthly income drop 95 percent. Israel Cassol, better known as Instagram’s Birkin Boy, used to make hundreds of dollars for every event he attended or every item he featured on his social media accounts. These days, he noted, he is borrowing money from his father to pay his bills.
“Everything has been canceled,” he told the BBC. “Normally, I post pictures with my bags and luxury clothes, but nobody wants to see that at the moment – nobody is interested in fashion because they’re not going anywhere.”
And while it might be true that no one is physically going anywhere, metaphorically speaking, consumers are going somewhere – because there are things they want to see, and they want certain people to show them those things. 
We are, of course, talking about social media’s three hottest rising new stars: Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx and Governor Andrew Cuomo.  
And lest you think we’re kidding, we’ll give you a moment to check out the Google Trend data, Instagram, Facebook and YouTube to get a firsthand feel for how wide the enthusiasm has spread for these three.
In some very strange and highly unexpected ways.
We imagine Dr. Fauci, for example, has been surprised to learn there is a massive write-in campaign across social media platforms to have him declared People Magazine’s Sexiest Man Alive for 2020. Thus far, over 11,000 people have signed that petition – and if he wins, he would be both the first doctor to have been awarded the title and the oldest person, at the age of 79 (Sean Connery, the previous record holder, was 59). In equally surreal news, Dr. Fauci’s emerging stardom was cemented further this week when he was played by 1995’s Sexiest Man Alive, Brad Pitt, on Saturday Night Live.
And it’s not just Faucimania sweeping the nation. Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator for the White House, is now a fashion icon with not one, but several, Instagram accounts, dedicated to her scarf collection, including @DeborahBirxscarves and @DrBirxScarves, not to mention the currently trending Twitter hashtag: #DrBirxScarves.
And New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has also become a recent subject of obsession for social media watchers. Favorite topics include his polo shirt collection, whether or not he’s hiding any interesting piercings from the public (he says he’s not, and his office has noted they would really like people to stop asking), and how many people are now officially identifying as “Cuomosexuals” due to their apparently romantic infatuation with his competence.
Governor Cuomo, incidentally, likes the term and supports people using it – so long as they agree that he is both more appealing and attractive than his brother, the CNN anchor (and COVID-19 survivor) Chris Cuomo, to whom the term has also recently been applied.
And, The New York Times recently reported, even the sillier stuff at the periphery of the rise of these three figures points to why they’ve displaced their glossier, more frivolous counterparts of several weeks ago. It is precisely because they aren’t glossy at all, but are staid, predictable dressers. That seems to be what people like about them – and why they are racking up followers and filling the role of cultural role models. They seem serious, focused, reliable and informative. They carry with them the sense that what they have to say is the most important thing about them – and everything else is just background.
And while the Fauci, Birx and Cuomo trio is the most public, prominent example right now, the trend in general is bigger than just those three. As eyeballs are drifting away from travel enthusiasts and Birkin bag collectors, they are looking toward doctors in particular, according to the latest edition of the MIT Technology Review. A report recently confirmed by Buzzfeed noted that doctors and nurses are suddenly the newest rising generation of social media stars.
Some of it is silly: Doctors and nurses doing dance routines on TikTok is a social media sensation that we feel confident no one saw coming three months ago. But most of it isn’t: There are stories about the frontline and the importance of social distancing, informational content about how to disinfect things properly or place a mask correctly on one’s face, and data about the symptoms of the virus and how to best monitor symptoms.
Mikhail Varshavski, better-known to his 3.6 million Instagram followers as Doctor Mike, believes this development represents a mostly positive phenomenon in the evolution of social media, insofar as it helps people with knowledge become influential at a time when their expertise is most vital.
Varshavski told Buzzfeed that he has been using social media to amplify his practice and his message for five years, and he says now is the time for medical professionals to step in and be part of the accurate information dissemination solution.
“It’s a high-stakes time to start doing this, but I think it is important to do this,” he said of his fellow healthcare providers, who are “creating new lines of communication” with those who just want to stay informed.
As it turns out, at a time when what people most want is information, particularly about their health and safety, the best way to become an influencer is to have that knowledge and also a willingness to share it.  
That may not always be the case – there is a future where people will once again be interested in Birkin bags, Balinese sunsets and a perfectly curated fantasy world, expertly photographed. But for now, at least, what everyone wants is a better understanding of reality – and as many access points as possible to the people who can deliver it.
And being able to tie a mean scarf, add an entirely new word to the English language or redefine the very concept of the sexiest man alive? Well, that probably doesn’t hurt either.

    <h5 class="mb-1">James Corden 'pays salaries for furloughed staff from own pocket'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">James Corden is paying the salaries of furloughed Late Late Show staff from his own pocket, it has been claimed.
The 41-year-old has been broadcasting the nightly series from his garage in LA for the last few weeks, due to coronavirus.
According to Variety, CBS covered eight weeks of salary for members of the production team who became sidelined following the changes.
The Gavin and Stacey actor is thought to picked up the responsibility himself, telling some Late Late Show staff that they will be furloughed from 4 May – and that he will be covering their salaries from his own pocket.
While the total cost is unclear, the publication states it is likely to be at least ‘five figures a week’.
Seriously generous.
James recently made headlines as he opened up about how he was dealing with life in lockdown. 
The actor – who underwent surgery this week –  struggled to contain his emotions as he lifted the lid on how the pandemic has affected him, during a recent instalment of the talk show.
’I hope [the show] has been a welcome break for you as much as it has been for me in what has been quite a scary couple of weeks,’ the star told viewers. 
‘I’ve found it tougher than I ever thought I would. I’ve found myself having these incredible spikes of anxiety and sadness when I’ve allowed myself to think about my family back home in England, or my friends or the people I love. 
‘You feel so out of control in it all. It feels so beyond our comprehension, all of it, that I’ve found I just get sort of overwhelmed with sadness in it all. 
‘And the truth is what I’ve realised is it’s OK. It’s alright to feel a bit sad.’ 
James added: ’It’s okay to feel anxious, and the best thing we can all do is try and breathe through that and try and put our minds in a positive place and think, “What can I do to help someone else who might be feeling like this?”’
Metro.co.uk has contacted James’ reps for a comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">James Corden offers to 'pay salaries for Late Late Show production staff that face being furloughed'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">James Corden is reportedly reaching into his own pocket to cover the salaries of 60 Late Late Show production staff.
The television host - who has been forced to film from his garage during lockdown - is said to have committed to the payments after CBS revealed they would no longer be covering their salaries.

According to Variety, James, 41, informed some staffers that they would be furloughed as of May 4 and that he would cover the salaries going forward.
While the total amount isn't clear, it is likely to be at least mid-five figures a week.
CBS covered eight weeks of salary for production staffers that were sent home by the sudden shutdown.
Fans took to Twitter to praise the star following the news.
One wrote: "Nice @JKCorden! I hope more people in your position step up and do the right thing for their staff."
Another said: "THIS! is what you do when you have the means."
A third tweeted: "Such a good human! But what is wrong with CBS? They are a major studio. They can afford to pay these people."
A fourth added: "This is leading by example! Kudos to James Corden!"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trevor Noah is paying 'Daily Show' staffers' salaries out of his own pocket</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">South African comedian Trevor Noah is reportedly paying the salaries of 25 staffers at The Daily Show who have been furloughed as a result of the Covid-19 lockdown. 
Variety reports that Trevor Noah is paying the monthly salaries of 25 members of The Daily Show (DStv 122) out of his own pocket.
He reportedly told staffers that he would continue to personally pay their salaries until The Daily Show returns to normal production from its New York studio.
"These are the people who have been on the show with Trevor from day one and help him put on the show," a source told thepublication, saying "Trevor is personally covering their salaries until the production business opens again. He respects his crew tremendously and feels it's only right that they get through this together."
This week the temporarily renamed The Daily Social Distancing Show was extended from 30 to 45 minutes. 
It will be the first time in the 24-year history of The Daily Show that episodes will be longer says Comedy Central in a statement.
"The news of supersized Daily Show episodes comes at a moment in time when viewers are heading to host Trevor Noah not just for satire and escapism, but also for an honest point of view and as a source of trustworthy information."
This week is the sixth week of The Daily Social Distancing Show that Trevor Noah now anchors from his home without the help of a live audience or the New York-based studio.

    <h5 class="mb-1">James Corden To Pay For The Salaries Of ‘The Late Late Show’ Out Of Work Staff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Helen Storms
James Corden will pay for the salaries of around 60 furloughed staffers.
James Corden, the host of The Late Late Show, will be paying the salaries of around 60 staff members of the show that are currently out of work as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. In-studio production of the show was put on hold on March 15 in an effort to protect the safety of the staff, according to The Daily Mail.
Since production was placed on hold, the staff members were still receiving paychecks from CBS over the course of eight weeks. However, that will end this week meaning that they will be officially considered furloughed as of May 4. From then on Corden will be taking over paying their salaries out of his own pocket. While the total amount that he will be paying per week to cover this cost has not been released to the public, it is expected to be mid-five figures.
As of April 14 Corden has been doing a virtual version of the show from his garage at home. He has been diligent in keeping connected with staff members by providing them with at-home projects whenever possible. Corden, executive producer Ben Winston, and some staff members have also been doing daily chats via Zoom.
It is still not clear when The Late Late Show, which is filmed in California, will be able to continue to start up production as normal again. However, the state is beginning to take steps to slowly re-open its economy, allowing some people to return to work.
The pandemic has caused even the normally jovial Corden to take pause and re-access what is really important in life, he confesses recently in an article for TIME.
In addition to Corden, comedian Trevor Noah has also stepped up to help out his staff members. As The Inquisitr previously reported, the host of The Daily Show With Trevor Noah will be paying for the salaries of 25 employees out of his own pocket until they are able to return to work.

    <h5 class="mb-1">James Corden pays out of his own pocket for furloughed staff’s salaries as Ellen DeGeneres leaves employees hanging</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LATE Late Show host James Corden has committed to paying his furloughed staff out of his own pocket.
The British host is covering the salaries of around 60 furloughed staffers after their CBS paychecks come to an end this week, according to Variety.
The host, who has been broadcasting his show from his garage in Los Angeles since April 14, picked up the responsibility for his staffers after CBS had covered their salary for eight weeks.
They had been sidelined by the sudden shutdown of the Late Late Show on March 15, as the coronavirus outbreak spurred social distancing mandates.
However, last week Corden informed some staffers that they would be furloughed as of May 4 and that he would cover the salaries going forward out of his own pocket, reports the industry publication.
The total cost to the Cats actor is unclear, but is likely to be at least mid-five figures a week, according to Variety.
New episodes of the show are still being broadcast from Ellen's own home as an in-studio production, but crew members were told to prepare for a 60 percent pay cut.
Speaking to Variety, a source said: "Radio silence from producers created anxiety among crew members who feared they would be furloughed and, in that case, would need to explore unemployment benefits."
They were left further disgruntled when they discovered that Ellen had hired a non-union company to help her produce the show from home - even though the normal crew have the same skills and are out of work.
Ellen earned $80.5 million last year, according to Forbes, and has a net worth of $330 million.
Corden is estimated to have a net worth of $12 million and earns around $5 million a year for the Late Late Show.
Both shows are usually filmed in Los Angeles, which has a stay at home order.
Corden has been married to Julia Carey since September 2012 and the couple share three children: son Max, 9, and daughters Carey, 5, and two-year-old Charlotte.

The singer had originally been set to embark on her High Road Tour in April, but postponed it amid the outbreak.

“Because of the current situation, doing this tour in 2020 is no longer feasible. But that doesn’t mean we can’t celebrate and express ourselves together in spirit and online. I will do my best to bring you all as much art and music as I can, as we get through this all together.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vanessa Bryant posted a sweet tribute to her late daughter Gigi on what would have been her 14th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vanessa Bryant posted a birthday message for her late daughter, Gianna, on what would be her 14th birthday on Friday.
Gianna “Gigi” Bryant, who was born on May 1, 2006, died in a helicopter crash with her father Kobe Bryant in Calabasas, California, in late January.
Seven passengers who were also aboard the helicopter were killed in the crash – Alyssa Altobelli, John Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, Christina Mauser, Payton Chester, Sarah Chester, and Ara Zobayan.
“Mommy loves you more than I can ever show you,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the post. “You are part of MY SOUL forever. I miss you so much everyday. I wish I could wake up and have you here with me.”
“I miss your smile, your hugs, and your giggles,” she continued. “I miss EVERYTHING about YOU, Gigi.”
Vanessa wrote in a follow-up post that her daughter “loved to wear a red bow in all of her school pictures,” and wanted people to “commemorate Gigi’s birthday today, please consider wearing red, caption an act of kindness or show how you will play Gigi’s way since she always gave everything she did her all and led with kindness.”
She posted a picture of a red bracelet with the words Gigi’s name and her nickname, “Mambacita,” writing that it will soon be on sale, the proceeds of which would benefit the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation, which was started in their memory.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Vanessa Bryant posted a sweet tribute to her late daughter Gigi on what would have been her 14th birthday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vanessa Bryant posted a birthday message for her late daughter, Gianna, on what would be her 14th birthday on Friday.
Gianna “Gigi” Bryant, who was born on May 1, 2006, died in a helicopter crash with her father Kobe Bryant in Calabasas, California, in late January.
Seven passengers who were also aboard the helicopter were killed in the crash – Alyssa Altobelli, John Altobelli, Keri Altobelli, Christina Mauser, Payton Chester, Sarah Chester, and Ara Zobayan.
“Mommy loves you more than I can ever show you,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the post. “You are part of MY SOUL forever. I miss you so much everyday. I wish I could wake up and have you here with me.”
“I miss your smile, your hugs, and your giggles,” she continued. “I miss EVERYTHING about YOU, Gigi.”
Vanessa wrote in a follow-up post that her daughter “loved to wear a red bow in all of her school pictures,” and wanted people to “commemorate Gigi’s birthday today, please consider wearing red, caption an act of kindness or show how you will play Gigi’s way since she always gave everything she did her all and led with kindness.”
She posted a picture of a red bracelet with the words Gigi’s name and her nickname, “Mambacita,” writing that it will soon be on sale, the proceeds of which would benefit the Mamba and Mambacita Sports Foundation, which was started in their memory.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WILTON, Conn. — Actor Joe Pantoliano, known for his roles in movies and in HBO’s “Sopranos,” is recovering at his Connecticut home after being struck by a car while walking.
Pantoliano’s agent told Variety the 68-year-old actor was walking near his rural home in Wilton when two nearby cars crashed into each other. The collision sent one of the cars sliding down the asphalt, where it collided with Pantoliano and knocked him to the ground.
The impact left him with a gash on his head and other injuries. His agent told Variety that Pantoliano was taken to a nearby hospital.
A post on Instagram showed Pantoliano with stitches in his head and giving a thumbs-up sign. It read, “Joey is home recovering. He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma.”
Pantoliano played mobster Ralph Cifaretto on the HBO series and has appeared in “The Matrix,” and other films including “Bad Boys,” “Risky Business,” “The Fugitive” and “Midnight Run.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Pantoliano is at home recovering after being hit by a car.
A rep for the Sopranos star confirmed to ET that Pantoliano, 68, was struck by a vehicle during a walk with his family on Friday.
Per the rep, Pantoliano was knocked over by a Porsche that had been T-boned by another vehicle and skidded across a road in Connecticut. The Porsche pushed the Bad Boys for Life actor into a wooden fence, leaving him with a gash on his head and injuries to one of his legs and shoulders. He was taken to a local hospital and has since returned home.
"He received stitches and is being monitored for a concussion and head trauma and is now home," the actor’s agent, Barry McPherson, said. "He is grateful for the concern and thoughts from his fans."
Once at home, photos of the actor and his head injury were shared on his Instagram, along with a message thanking everyone for their well wishes.
"Joey is home recovering. He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma. He is going to be dark for a couple days while recovering," the post reads. "Thank you for all the well wishes and positive vibes. Keep them coming! We'll reading them to him to help him get better!"
The post quickly filled with even more positive and supportive messages. The Sopranos star Kathrine Narducci, as well as Michael Gandolfini, Maureen McCormick, Jennifer Tilly and Michael Chiklis, among others, left their friend notes.
"Oh good, was worried! Feel better," Gandolfini wrote.
"Lucky you're so tough and stubborn! Try and stick around for another 40 years will!" Tilly commented. "American cinema needs you! You are a national treasure."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sopranos star Joe Pantoliano was rushed to hospital with a ‘severe head injury’ after being hit by a car.
The 68-year-old actor was struck by a Porsche during a walk with his family in their neighbourhood in Connecticut on Friday.

A family friend posted two photos of him giving the camera a thumbs-up while revealing the wound on his head on his Instagram account on Friday night.
They explained in the caption: ‘Joey is home recovering. He has a severe head injury and some chest trauma.
‘He is going to be dark for a couple days while recovering. Thank you for all the well wishes and positive vibes. Keep them coming!
‘We’ll reading them to him to help him get better!’
Both drivers in the crash stayed at the scene and police are investigating, accordin to TMZ.
Joe posted a video of a rainbow that was filmed shortly before the accident.
He filmed the rainbow before showing his family walking in front of him and wrote: ‘Look at that rainbow! How do you like that beauty?
‘And all my little rainbows ahead of me.’ 
After shooting to fame in The Sopranos, Joe played Captain Howard in the Bad Boys films and appeared in films like The Matrix and Risky Business.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Sopranos' and 'Bad Boys' star Joe Pantoliano struck by a vehicle, rushed to hospital: report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">No, he wasn't hit by shrapnel.
Actor Joe Pantoliano was struck by a vehicle while out for a stroll on Friday and was taken to a Connecticut hospital, according to a report.
Later Friday evening, Pantoliano’s wife, Nancy, told TMZ that the “Sopranos” cast member was recovering at home after suffering "a severe head injury and some chest trauma."
Photos posted to the site showed the 68-year-old native of Hoboken, N.J., with a nasty, stitched-up cut on the left side of his head but he was smiling and giving the "thumbs up" sign.
Nancy said the popular "Joey Pants" was walking with the family in their neighborhood when a Porsche was allegedly T-boned by another car and sent across the road where Pantoliano was walking, hitting him.
Nancy reportedly told the outlet that Pantoliano, who is also well-recognized as the loud and anxious Captain Howard in the popular “Bad Boys” film franchise -- as well as the creepy mobster Ralph Cifaretto on "The Sopranos," known for hitting Tony Soprano's sister Janice with "shrapnel" when clipping his toenails -- was sent airborne a couple of feet backward where he crashed into an old wooden fence and got a gash to his head, along with injuries to his left leg and shoulder.

Paramedics are said to have arrived quickly and rushed the “Matrix” actor to a nearby hospital where he is currently being treated and awaiting the results of a CT scan, TMZ reports.

According to the outlet, per Nancy, the drivers of both vehicles involved in the accident stayed at the scene while police were investigating.
Pantoliano shared a video to his Instagram account Friday morning of lush greenery with a rainbow backdrop, which family members reportedly said was taken before he left for his walk.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Pantoliano was reportedly rushed to a hospital after being struck by a car.
Pantoliano and his family were walking in their Connecticut neighbourhood when a skidding Porsche struck the “Sopranos” actor, according to a report from TMZ. The Porsche had been T-boned by another vehicle, the publication added, sourcing the actor’s wife Nancy Pantoliano.
“Nancy says Joe was sent flying a couple feet backward into an old wooden fence. He suffered a gash on his head, plus injuries to his left leg and a shoulder,” the report reads. “EMTs quickly arrived and rushed Joe to a hospital where he’s being treated and waiting on the results of a CT scan.”
Pantoliano is expected to pull through, local police are investigating the situation and both drivers stayed at the potential crime scene.
ET Canada reached out to a rep for the actor, who said Pantoliano “is home recovering and being monitored for a concussion and chest trauma. He is grateful for the good wishes of his fans.”
Pantoliano later took to Instagram to share an update, showing off stitches on his head while the caption reveals he suffered “a severe head injury” and will be “going dark for a couple of days while recovering.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scrubs star Sam Lloyd’s wife has broken her silence after the actor’s death. He was diagnosed with brain cancer last year, and fans were very saddened to learn of his passing. The 56-year-old’s wife Vanessa Lloyd issued a statement to The Wrap about her husband. They had been battling the disease and Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife had set up a GoFundMe campaign for the actor. The tumor was inoperable, and fans pitched in to help in the fight with that wretched disease. Lloyd’s agent confirmed the news with the press yesterday. Multiple cast members have also tweeted out their feelings after working with the actor on the beloved series.
“Sam passed away peacefully at 10:30 on April 30, 2020 as a result of complications from lung cancer,” her statement begins. “Our family is devastated. It doesn’t feel real. It never will. It just feels like he will walk through the door.”
“The overwhelming outpouring of love and sharing your stories about working with or knowing Sam keeps his memory alive and our hearts strong,” she continues. “Sam loved his work. I want to continue his legacy, and hope to share some of the beautiful songs he was working on for his musical and our son, Weston.”
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence tweeted a message of remembrance for Lloyd. "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many." Lloyd's other appearances as his Scrubs character actually came in another Lawrence created series, the Courteney Cox fronted Cougar Town.
Zach Braff was the star of Scrubs and he tweeted about Lloyd as well, saying: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Lloyd appeared in 95 episodes of Scrubs during the show’s run on NBC and ABC. He’s had more than 60 credits over the course of his career. So many television shows that are fan favorites have seen appearances from Lloyd. These include: Modern Family, Spin City, Seineld, Happy Together, Desperate Housewives, Shameless and more.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scrubs star Sam Lloyd was in coma for two months before death aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scrubs star Sam Lloyd was in a coma for two months before he passed away.
An agent for the actor confirmed that the 56-year-old died on 30 April, 16 months after he was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour.
It has now been revealed that Lloyd fell into a coma for nearly two months after multiple brain surgeries, when his targeted therapy drug lost its effectiveness.
On a GoFundMe for Sam, his friend Tim Hobert wrote: ‘Our dear sweet Sammy has passed away. 
‘On April 30th at a respiratory facility in Los Angeles with his beautiful wife, Vanessa, at his side and his sister, Laurel, FaceTiming from New Hampshire, Samuel Lloyd Jr. left this earth and was reunited with his dad (Samuel Lloyd Sr.), his mom (Marianna McGuffin), and his brother (Jackson Lloyd). 
‘Sam’s fight began on January 17, 2019 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer that metastasized to his brain, liver, spine, and jaw. Things did not look good. After an outpouring of love from Sam’s friends and people from all over the world, Sam was put on a new targeted therapy drug and had an amazing resurgence. For 13 months Sam lived life to the fullest, treasuring every moment. He saw his son, Weston, turn 1, he was able to hold his mom’s hand as she took her last breath, and as Sam always loved to say, “he made music along the way.”’
Tim continued: ‘At the end of 2019, Sam found out that the targeted therapy drug which had given him such a miraculous second chance had lost its effectiveness. Determined to live, and with so much to live for, Sam fought hard, enduring multiple brain surgeries, and endless tests and procedures. In spite of all these things, Sam always mustered up the strength to say “I love you” to Vanessa, Weston, and his many close friends who came to visit him. 
‘Eventually the fight became more intense and Sam slipped into a coma for nearly 2 months. Vanessa never stopped believing that Sam would rebound and be reunited with her and Weston and all the people who love Sam so much. She stayed by his side day in and day out – even figuring out ways to visit him during the covid restrictions. 
‘But alas it was time for Sam to leave this world. A world that he made a better place every day of his life. 
‘Rest in peace sweet, sweet Sammy boy. We loved you more than words can tell.’
Two months ago, Tim had updated followers of the fundraiser on Sam’s fight, explaining that in February he had been admitted to hospital with swelling on the brain after his therapy lost effectiveness. 
After surgery to remove a tumour was successful, there were further complications and he required a second emergency brain surgery.
Tim wrote: ‘In the 13 months since Sam’s original diagnosis, with help from you guys (incredible people from all over the world), he has made the most of the time that he has been given. He was able to go back to his home state of Vermont and play his annual gig with his Beatles band, The Butties. He was able to do guest spots on Modern Family and American Housewife that allowed him to qualify for the Screen Actors Guild insurance policy. 
‘He was able to spend time with dear friends, help his mother in the last stages of her life, and sing for her at her funeral, and most importantly, he was able to spend time with his wife, Vanessa, and celebrate Weston’s first birthday!’
The fundraiser has so far raised $170,998 (£136,811), after aiming for $100,000 (£80,000).
Lloyd’s Scrubs co-stars including Zach Braff and Sarah Chalke have shared their tributes to the actor on social media, saying ‘he could not have been a kinder man’.
The actor was best known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland in Scrubs, and he also reprised the role in Cougar Town. 
Lloyd also starred in Seinfeld and Desperate Housewives, and sang in his Beatles tribute band The Butties and a capella group The Blanks, who made a number of appearances in Scrubs.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Actor Sam Lloyd, perhaps best known for his turn as morose hospital lawyer Ted Buckland on Scrubs, has died at the age of 56. According to a GoFundMe established to help Lloyd and his family last year, the actor learned he had an inoperable brain tumor in January 2019, the result of metastatic lung cancer.
In addition to playing Scrubs’ ever-present sad-sack attorney, Lloyd appeared on Cougar Town, Modern Family, Desperate Housewives, and in films like 1997’s Flubber and 1999’s Galaxy Quest. Lloyd was the nephew of actor Christopher Lloyd, both of whom appeared on Malcom in the Middle and The West Wing. A lifelong musician, Lloyd’s a cappella group, the Blanks, appeared on Scrubs as Ted’s own a cappella group. The actor is survived by wife Vanessa Lloyd and their son, Weston.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Scrubs' actor Sam Lloyd dead at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd -- best known for portraying lawyer Ted Buckland on the sitcom "Scrubs" -- has died, his agent confirmed to Fox News on Friday. He was 56.
Lloyd died on Thursday as a result of complications from lung cancer, according to a statement obtained by Fox News from the late actor's wife, Vanessa.
"Our family is devastated. It doesn't feel real. It never will. It just feels like he will walk through the door," the statement continued. "The overwhelming outpouring of love and sharing your stories about working with or knowing Sam keeps his memory alive and our hearts strong.

"Sam loved his work. I want to continue his legacy, and hope to share some of the beautiful songs he was working on for his musical and our son, Weston," the statement concluded.
In January 2019, Lloyd was diagnosed with a brain tumor shortly after Vanessa gave birth to their first child together -- a son named Weston, according to a GoFundMe page for the late actor. Doctors also found that the cancer had metastasized from his lungs and spread to his spine, jaw and liver, per the page, which was created by "Scrubs" executive producer Tim Hobert.
In addition to starring as Ted on the long-running series "Scrubs," Lloyd appeared in a handful of shows over the span of his career, including "Cougar Town,” “Desperate Housewives,” “Seinfeld,” “Modern Family,” “The West Wing” and “Shameless,” as well as movies such as “Flubber” and “Galaxy Quest.”

According to Variety, Lloyd also sang in an a cappella group The Blanks, which performed on "Scrubs" as The Worthless Peons. He also played bass guitar in the Beatles tribute band The Butties.
Following news of his passing, tributes poured in from the "Scrubs" family.
Bill Lawrence, creator of “Scrubs,” shared a behind-the-scenes snapshot of Lloyd, captioning it: “Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."
Zach Braff tweeted: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Scrubs' Actor Sam Lloyd Dies at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sam Lloyd, best known for his role as New Sacred Heart lawyer Ted Buckland on the long-running NBC-ABC medical comedy Scrubs, died Thursday night in Los Angeles, his rep, Kevin Turner, told The Hollywood Reporter. He was 56.
The Vermont native had been diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor last year, which was revealed in a GoFundMe campaign launched by Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife, Jill. The fundraiser had raised nearly $160,000.
In a family statement provided by his wife, Vanessa Lloyd, she wrote, "Sam passed away peacefully at 10:30 on April 30th, 2020 as a result of complications from lung cancer. Our family is devastated. It doesn't feel real. It never will. It just feels like he will walk through the door.
"The overwhelming outpouring of love and sharing your stories about working with or knowing Sam keeps his memory alive and our hearts strong," she continued. "Sam loved his work. I want to continue his legacy, and hope to share some of the beautiful songs he was working on for his musical and our son, Weston."
Scrubs star Zach Braff paid tribute to Lloyd on Twitter, writing: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence also paid his respects on social media, tweeting: "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."
Aside from appearing on 95 episodes of Scrubs as Buckland, Lloyd reprised the role for another Lawrence series, Cougar Town. His other TV credits included Lawrence's Spin City, Seinfeld, Desperate Housewives, Shameless, Modern Family and Happy Together. On the film side, he appeared in Galaxy Quest and Flubber.
Survivors include his wife and Weston, who was born in 2019.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Scrubs' star Sam Lloyd has died aged 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BELOVED US TV star Sam Lloyd has sadly passed away. 
Lloyd, who was best known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland on the hit medical comedy series Scrubs, died on Thursday evening in Los Angeles, aged 56. 
His representative, Kevin Turner, confirmed the tragic news to The Hollywood Reporter. 
Lloyd, who was originally from Vermont, was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour last year. 
News of his illness was revealed after Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife Jill launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise money for his treatment. 
The campaign raised close to $160,000. 
However, an update on the GoFundMe campaign page revealed back in February that Sam had been rushed to hospital after suffering swelling on his brain. 
Though doctors were able to remove a tumour, there were further complications resulting in two further emergency brain surgeries. 
Sam was later transferred to ICU at Cedars Sinai hospital in LA, where he was put on a “breathing tube and feeding tube”.  
News of his sad passing prompted an outpouring of tributes from his Scrubs co-star. 
They were led by Zach Braff, who wrote on Twitter: 
Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I’ve ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together. He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy." 
Fellow co-star and character actor Robert Maschio also posted a warm tribute to his late colleague, posting a picture of them together alongside the message: “Simpler times, happier days, the kindest man I ever met.  ‘Easy going Sam, Rest In Peace. #RIPSamLloyd.” 
Scrubs creator Bill Lawrence, meanwhile wrote: "Spent the night watching clips of Sam (The songs! The greatest sweaty pratfall of all time!) Those who reached out, our “Scrubs family” appreciates it - he had the biggest heart of all of us. But now send all those good thoughts to his family. And to your own loved ones." 
A regular and much loved character on Scrubs, Sam enjoyed a raft of appearances across some of America’s best loved comedies of the past few decades with credits on Spin City, Seinfeld, Desperate Housewives, Shameless, Modern Family and Happy Together. 
He also racked up an impressive film resume that includes parts in Galaxy Quest and Flubber. 
A warm, funny and talented man, he is survived by his wife Vanessa and son Weston, who was born in 2019.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scrubs actor Sam Lloyd dead at 56</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON – Scrubs star Sam Lloyd has died at the age of 56, after battling an inoperable brain tumour.
The actor, who was the nephew of actor Christopher Lloyd and played lawyer Ted Buckland in the medical comedy series, died on Thursday after battling an inoperable brain tumour.
Scrubs producer Tom Hobert and his wife previously launched a GoFundMe campaign to raise funds for Lloyd as he battled the disease and his death was announced on the site.
They wrote: "Our dear sweet Sammy has passed away.
"On April 30th at a respiratory facility in Los Angeles with his beautiful wife, Vanessa, at his side and his sister, Laurel, FaceTiming from New Hampshire, Samuel Lloyd Jr. left this earth and was reunited with his dad (Samuel Lloyd Sr.), his mom (Marianna McGuffin), and his brother (Jackson Lloyd).
"Sam's fight began on 17 January 2019 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer that metastasized to his brain, liver, spine, and jaw. Things did not look good. After an outpouring of love from Sam's friends and people from all over the world, Sam was put on a new targeted therapy drug and had an amazing resurgence. For 13 months Sam lived life to the fullest, treasuring every moment. He saw his son, Weston, turn 1, he was able to hold his mom's hand as she took her last breath, and as Sam always loved to say, 'he made music along the way'.
"At the end of 2019, Sam found out that the targeted therapy drug which had given him such a miraculous second chance had lost its effectiveness. Determined to live, and with so much to live for, Sam fought hard, enduring multiple brain surgeries, and endless tests and procedures. Despite all these things, Sam always mustered up the strength to say "I love you" to Vanessa, Weston, and his many close friends who came to visit him.
"Eventually the fight became more intense and Sam slipped into a coma for nearly two months.
Vanessa never stopped believing that Sam would rebound and be reunited with her and Weston and all the people who love Sam so much. She stayed by his side day in and day out - even figuring out ways to visit him during the COVID restrictions.
"But alas it was time for Sam to leave this world. A world that he made a better place every day of his life.
"Rest in peace sweet, sweet Sammy boy. We loved you more than words can tell."
_Scrubs _creator Bill Lawrence wrote on Twitter: "Thinking a lot about Sam Lloyd today. (Ted). Truly such a kind, sweet guy. He will be missed by so many."
And show star Zach Braff added: "Rest In Peace to one of the funniest actors I've ever had the joy of working with. Sam Lloyd made me crack up and break character every single time we did a scene together.
"He could not have been a kinder man. I will forever cherish the time I had with you, Sammy."
Lloyd - who also appeared in Cougar Town, Desperate Housewives, The West Wing and Malcolm in the Middle - is survived by his wife Vanessa and their son Weston.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Having realized famous people love belting out their favorite Disney songs as much as us plebeians, the Disney Family Singalong: Volume II has been announced for Sunday, May 10 at 7 p.m. EST on ABC. While Ariana Grande and Beyoncé stole the singalong last time, only time will tell whose vocals will go from (not any where near) zero to (your personal quarantine) hero.
The celebrities and musicians singing next Sunday will include Chloe x Halle, Billy Eichner, Hayley Erbert, Halsey, Josh Gad, Donald Glover, Derek Hough, Julianne Hough, Idina Menzel, Miguel, Keke Palmer, Ben Platt, Seth Rogen, Anika Noni Rose, Walter Russell III, Rebel Wilson, and Shakira, not to mention Broadway stars like Merle Dandridge, Heather Headley, Adam Jacobs, Caissie Levy, Kara Lindsay, Kevin Massey, and Josh Strickland. 
Check out the hour-long special’s tracklist below, but keep in mind, more famous people will likely sign up before long. They better hurry and call dibs, though. No one wants to be the celebrity stuck scaring kids with The Hunchback of Notre Dame’s “Hellfire” or some such.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Host of stars announced for second Disney Family Singalong</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The broadcast raises money for the coronavirus relief effort.
Shakira, Lion King star Donald Glover and Frozen’s Idina Menzel have been announced as taking part in the second Disney Family Singalong.
The entertainment giant is bringing together a host of stars to perform some of its best known songs for a broadcast raising money for the coronavirus relief effort.
During the first show last month, Beyonce made a surprise appearance while Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato also performed.
For the next broadcast, acts announced so far include Shakira, who will be singing her hit Try Everything from 2016 animated blockbuster Zootopia.
Menzel will team up with Broadway star Ben Platt for a duet of A Whole New World from Aladdin while Glover is set to reunite with  his Lion King remake co-stars Seth Rogen and Billy Eichner for a performance of Hakuna Matata.
Other highlights from the May 10 show include Halsey singing Part Of Your World from The Little Mermaid and Rebel Wilson covering Poor Unfortunate Souls from the same film.
And following news that Disney is working on a live-action remake of 1997 animated classic Hercules, Keke Palmer will take on Zero To Hero.
Additional celebrities and performance details will be announced soon, Disney said.
The Disney Family Singalong: Volume II, hosted by Ryan Seacrest, will air in the US on May 10 and will be available to stream on Disney+ “in the days that follow,” the company said.
Money raised will go to food bank charity Feeding America and its work feeding families amid the coronavirus pandemic.

According to Entertainment Weekly, the evening's lineup will include an eclectic mix. Little Mermaid fans won't want to miss Idina Menzel and Ben Platt singing "A Whole New World," Halsey belting out an indie rendition of "Part of Your World," or Rebel Wilson's version of "Poor Unfortunate Souls". If The Lion King is more your speed, tune in for Billy Eichner and Seth Rogan performing "Hakuna Matata" featuring Donald Glover. Pixar lovers can enjoy Miguel singing "Remember Me" from Coco and Shakira will sing "Try Everything" from Zootopia. For a tribute to the Disney classic Mary Poppins, Julianne Hough, Derek Hough, and Hayley Erbert will perform a "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" and "Step in Time" medley.
Keep in mind that your family can stream the first singalong performance on Disney+ now — so you can make sure the kiddos practice their favorite tunes before Mother's Day!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sheridan Smith and baby bump make lockdown TV debut as Mel in Isolation Stories</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sheridan Smith is to appear in the first episode of an emotional new television series called Isolation Stories.
The actress, 38, is just weeks away from giving birth and will show off her blossoming belly when she stars as heavily pregnant character Mel.
The new ITV series begins on May 4 and will document the experiences that families face during the coronavirus lockdown in 15-minute episodes throughout the week.
On Monday, Sheridan becomes Mel, an expectant single mother that is isolating alone during the lockdown.
In the emotional scenes, the downcast character speaks to her friends via video call but in fact doesn't mind being in isolation.
During the convincing and tearful performance, the character struggles to come to term with her baby's imminent birth as well as going through the pregnancy without the married father of her child.
In a snippet ahead of Monday's show, Sheridan is featured in different rooms of her home while exchanging virtual moments with pals.
In one scene, Mel struggled to cast a smile as a friend is heard saying: "Melanie, let's see the bump."
Another scene later in the short episode featured the character sobbing on the phone as she heard the words: "You're going to be a lovely mum."
According to the Sheridan, she had had jumped at the opportunity to be involved with the miniseries because she felt it was important to reflect on what is going on.
"I am heavily pregnant and have been isolating at home," she said.
"So I jumped at the chance to make a drama about the massive drama going on all around us right now.
The entire series has also been recorded in line with the country's strict isolation guidelines.
During the filming of the show, produced by Oscar nominee Jeff Pope, directors would remotely instruct the actors on camera angles and scene composition.
As well as Sheridan Smith, actor Robert Glenister, Eddie Marsan and Angela Griffin will also star in episodes during the week.
Isolation Storiesairs at 9pm over four nights on ITV from tomorrow.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pregnant Sheridan Smith weeps and cradles her baby bump in an emotional new trailer for ITV's hardhitting drama Isolation Stories inspired by the coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A heavily pregnant Sheridan Smith weeps and cradles her baby bump in an emotional new trailer for hardhitting ITV drama Isolation Stories.  
The actress, 38, takes a starring role in Isolation Stories, a collection of four brand new stand-alone episodes born out of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, which has so far claimed 227,638 lives across the world.
Sheridan - who is expecting her first child with Jamie Horn - stars in the first of the four 15-minute episodes from BAFTA-winning executive producer Jeff Pope, which tells the stories of four different families, inspired by true people, coping through the crisis.
In a new trailer for the drama, Sheridan, who plays Mel in the TV short, can be seen weeping as she video-calls family and discussing her upcoming motherhood. 
In the trailer for the drama, which starts tomorrow night, Sheridan's character Mel can be seen video calling loved-ones from her home.
Upon asking how many people are staying together, she is gutted to learn that there are 11 people isolating together, while she remains alone.
Emotionally, she says: 'You've got 11 people there and you didn't even ask me.'
And later, she is seen crying while speaking on the phone with someone about motherhood. 
Director Jeff previously told how viewers will find her episode very emotional as the actress reveals her baby bump on camera for the first time. 
He said: 'She had an enormous bump which makes an appearance at the end of the… She unveils this amazing… Then you see it – then she pulls it up, and it's a very emotional moment at the end.'
Of Sheridan's decision to take the role while heavily pregnant herself, he added: 'She's in very good health. She's not got pre-eclampsia or any of those conditions that would be dangerous.' 
Reflecting on the shoot, which took place in the home she shares with her insurance broker fiancé, Sheridan admitted it was left to him to set up the production equipment and handle the cameras while she filmed her scenes. 
She explained: 'They dropped off lots of camera, lighting and sound equipment at the gate, all disinfected. Jamie was then talked through how it all worked.
'We had a crew of people on Zoom with us at all times during filming, explaining to Jamie where to place the cameras and lighting, he was amazing and isn’t in the industry so I was so proud of him. 
'He was so good and turned out to be a natural cameraman. They were so impressed that they trusted him to do camera shots that are even tricky with a whole crew. 
'I couldn’t help much with lifting, currently being so pregnant myself, so I was in charge of costume, make up, continuity etc.' 
The actress admits she immediately said yes to the project after an initial approach from Oscar nominated writer and producer Pope, who laid the foundations for the series after watching wife Tina struggle with coronavirus symptoms. 
She said: 'I am heavily pregnant and have been isolating at home so I jumped at the chance to make a drama about the massive drama going on all around us right now. 
'I think it's really important to try and reflect what's happening to us whilst it is still.' 
Six weeks of government mandated lockdown has also made Sheridan acutely aware of her good fortune in having Jamie, while character Mel faces an uncertain future without the father of her child, and without her family - who have abandoned her. 
'I’m lucky I have the baby coming soon so it’s been a focus for me,' she said. 'I think it would be hard for people like the character I play in the drama, as she is on her own. And obviously it’s hard for all the families being kept apart at the minute, so I count myself lucky and we have adapted to this new “normal” for now. 
'Clapping for the carers and watching all the beautiful situations happening have put things into perspective. It’s a terribly sad time for so many. 
'But people coming together encouraging each other to stay strong has been a wonderful thing to witness.' 
Robert and Tom Glenister, Eddie Marsan, Angela Griffin, Darren Boyd, David Threlfall, Michael Jibson, Leanne Best and Philip Jackson will also feature in the new four-part series. 
Isolation Stories will air at 9pm for four consecutive nights on ITV1 from Monday May 4th.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michelle Mone EXCLUSIVE: 'I was abusing myself' Lingerie tycoon likens being overweight to self-abuse as she reveals past battle with her size left her with depression</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Michelle Mone has likened being overweight to self-abuse as she discussed her previous weight battle.
The lingerie tycoon, 48, told how she was 'abusing myself' when she was at her heaviest, adding that her issue with her size left her feeling depressed.
In a candid new interview, Michelle admitted that her weight left her feeling at an all-time low, but the it was the support of her parents that helped her on her weight-loss journey.
In recent years, the star has shed eight stone and now wears a size 10.
However, it was a tough journey to get where she is now, with Michelle confessing that in 2012 following her divorce from her first husband Michael, the pounds continued to creep on and she developed depression. 
In an exclusive interview with the Daily Mail, she said: 'I was at my heaviest and had three children running around me and [I was] launching Ultimo around the world. I was getting bigger and bigger. 
'I was abusing myself. I was on antidepressants from the doctor. It was awful.’ 
In her darkest hour, it was her parents Duncan, 70, and Isabel, 71, that made her see the light and realise she had to lose the weight 'for yourself'.
She explained: 'My mum and dad used to be in tears. My dad wrote me heartfelt letters writing, “Please Michelle just do it for yourself I’m begging".
While she said her mother begged: 'Enough of this nonsense and feeling sorry for yourself, you’ll have more to feel sorry for if you can’t put food on the table for your kids so ... make it work.’
The Scottish beauty went on to overhaul her lifestyle and dropped a whopping eight stone over the years.     
Meanwhile, Michelle recently revealed she used to plaster unflattering photos of herself around her kitchen to motivate her to lose weight. 
The entrepreneur told how she would stick up the snaps in order to try and stop herself from snacking after she previously reached a size 22.
Speaking to The Mirror, she said: 'Weight loss is all about your mindset. For many years I put pictures of myself that I didn’t like in the kitchen, it put me off snacking. 
'I’ve finally got to know my body and feel amazing in skinny jeans. I just need to be careful I don’t put it all back on now I’m hanging around the house all day.'
Michelle likened her body to a business, saying she would not destroy her business so why would she destroy her body? 
The businesswoman, who previously admitted posing for naked selfies to motivate her to lose the pounds, is now a size 10.       
Michelle admitted she was 'devastated' to have to postpone her wedding to fiancé Doug Barrowman because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Lady Mone, who was due to tie the knot this week, admitted she was not looking to get into a relationship when she first met billionaire Doug and was originally put off by how wealthy and powerful he is.    
She said: 'We’d both invested in the same tech company and met at a dinner in 2016. I wasn’t ready for a relationship and said I wanted to just be friends. I was put off by how powerful and wealthy he was, because I’m independent.'
However, Michelle was won over by Doug's 'sense of fun' while she also credits their respective children for getting them together.  
The businesswoman and her other half had spent the last two years planning their special day, which will now take place in August, followed by a honeymoon to the far east. 
Michelle said she and Doug have been having virtual parties with their friends on Zoom amid lockdown.
The Ultimo founder explained that after 20 years of being burned out by work, she has finally got her work-life balance right. 
Michelle recently revealed that she has hit her target weight and branded herself 'wedding ready' as she flaunted her slim size 10 frame on Instagram, after losing her final 11 pounds over the past few months. 
She celebrated her weight-loss on social media, admitting that it's taken her seven years to reach her goal and explaining how she shed the pounds.
Michelle uploaded a stunning - and very smiley - selfie, which displayed her trim frame down to her knees.  
Alongside the snap, she wrote: 'After 7 years I've finally made my target weight!! There is only one way to do it...eat less, eat healthy & work out 1 hour a day...
'Finally lost my last 11ibs in the past few months. Size 10 & wedding ready' gushed the entrepreneur.
In 2017 the Glaswegian businesswoman revealed that she said she had lost more than half a stone since becoming a vegetarian
Michelle also previously revealed she underwent skin tightening with a celebrity cosmetic medic after shedding the pounds.
It comes after Michelle revealed she's been in secret talks to join Dragons' Den.
The underwear tycoon admitted she turned down appearing on the show several times, but hinted she would be open to appearing on the series to 'inspire people' following the COVID-19 pandemic.
Michelle became one of the UK's top businesswomen after founding underwear brand Ultimo in 1996, and is thought to be worth around £50 million.
Speaking to The Sun, Michelle said she had been approached to appear on Dragons' Den several times, and had turned it down despite numerous big money offers.
She said: 'In the past, I've been offered Dragons' Den and I've turned it down due to business commitments.
'But I just feel that after this whole coronavirus crisis is over, we need to be lifted up as individuals — we need to feel there is a real purpose in life and what we're going to do with our lives.
'I might be open to something that might help to give people inspiration.'
Dragons' Den sees budding entrepreneurs pitch their products to a panel of businessmen and women who are looking to invest their millions in return for a percentage of their business.
The current lineup consists of Peter Jones, 54, plus long-serving Deborah Meaden, 61, Sara Davies, 35, Tej Lalvani, 45, and Touker Suleyman, 66.

Fans of the mum-of-five won't be able to help date her breakdown timeline to her very public split from first husband Peter Andre in 2009, they divorced in September that year.
Now brunette Katie, who went on to marry cage fighter Alex Reid in 2010 which ended in less than a year, and sex cheat Kieran Hayler in 2013, says she is finally ready to face her demons as she films her Quest Red TV show.
In a clip released on Saturday night, the star confesses: "I've been slowly going off the rails for just over ten years at times I have been a mess.
"Four weeks in hospital and some intensive therapy that will continue for the rest of my life. I've been to hell and back but I am starting to feel like me again."
Katie has always said she didn't want to split from first husband Pete, who went on to marry doctor Emily MacDonagh and have two children, Theo and Amelia.
She said she would always feel regrets over her split with her first husband, speaking last year Katie confessed: "And with Pete, I probably wouldn’t have done so much stuff in the media because I reckon we still would be together if certain people hadn’t been involved 100%."
As early as this year Katie's ex caretaker Charlie Farthing painted a bleak picture of Katie's life in her old 11 bedroom pile - revealing piles of dog poo everywhere, the stench of cat pee from her hairless moggy and gales whipping through the mansion after son Harvey smashed in windows.
But Charlie, who worked for the mum of five for four months, also worryingly tells how the star would come stumbling home after club nights with cash spilling out of her bag.
And, even more concerning, was the discovery of empty packets of drugs under a solitary mattress Katie slept on in the annexe of her West Sussex home.
Charlie told The Sun : “I was tidying up the annexe and I was moving the bed about and there were a couple of little bags, empty wraps that looked like they used to have coke in them so I suspected she’d used them at some point.
“I didn’t see her drink that much in the house, or take drugs, but when she came back from nights out she was clearly off her head, so I knew she was on something.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Say namaste to quarantine's queen of yoga: Forget Joe Wicks! With free classes to calm anxiety, ease loneliness and even beat the lockdown lard ADRIENE MISHLER has got over a million Brits hooked</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Take a deep breath, put your hands together and say namaste to Adriene Mishler, the queen of quarantine yoga.
Joe Wicks may have conquered the hearts of pent-up five-year-olds but, for midlife women, the 35-year-old instructor reigns supreme.
As thousands of us take up at-home classes to keep calm and exercise inflexible bodies, YouTube's biggest yoga guru (7.2 million subscribers including 1.1 million Brits) is among the 500 YouTube stars who have seen the biggest increases in their subscriber base over the past four weeks.
She favours a mind and body practice which has its roots in ancient Indian philosophy. But I'd argue there are two things that have really got us hooked.
First, she advocates 'yoga quickies'—classes timed to last between five and 45 minutes. She believes a little daily yoga practice goes a long way and not many of us want those intimidating hour-long classes where we work up a sweat and try to master handstands.
Secondly, she offers sessions targeted at the mood swings many people are experiencing during lockdown. There's yoga for anxiety, or for when you're angry or suffering. There is also yoga for focus and productivity, relationships and gratitude. And even, controversially, yoga for weight loss.
'It was always my dream to see yoga being practised as a normal thing in households, a tool that we could use — like opening a medicine cabinet,' says Adriene, who has gained a million more followers during lockdown. 'It's unfortunate that it's happening under these circumstances, but I'm seeing it now.'
Adriene is talking to me via FaceTime from her home in Austin, Texas, where her yoga videos are filmed. She lives alone with her dog Benji, who features in her broadcasts and is humorously referred to as her 'assistant'.
'I've been at home for a long time and I'm starting to feel this push-pull,' she says. 'One minute I'm celebrating being alone because it's a bit of a respite, and the next I have discomfort and the feeling of being lonely. I'm trying to find the balance and centre in this.'
She grew up in a theatrical family — her parents were actors — and Adriene believed she, too, was destined for a life in theatre or films. She would practice yoga as a warm-up during rehearsals for dance shows and amateur dramatics, but a class she took at the age of 17 was her lightbulb moment.
'It was the first time I'd done yoga just for me, with no ulterior motive,' she recalls. 'I had this moment of pure joy. It was potent and I wanted everyone to feel this.'
Adriene undertook the hundreds of hours it takes to become a yoga teacher and, as an actor, began what she calls 'the grind of the starving middle-class artist'.
'It was a hand-to-mouth way of living,' she says. 'I'd get up and teach yoga, then do a drama class with children, then nanny.
'I'd go and pick children up from school and do homework and dinner and fold other people's laundry, then drive through traffic and go to rehearsal, then have a glass of wine with my mates to decompress. I'd get up the next day and do it all again. I did that until I was 26.
'On Saturdays I'd teach children's yoga, and the next day I'd work the check-in table for the adult yoga class so I could take it for free.
'Even a few years into doing Yoga With Adriene on YouTube, I was still mopping floors in studios in exchange for free classes. That's a huge piece of this story, because I couldn't afford to do regular yoga classes, and I thought there were probably others who couldn't afford it as well.'
Adriene, in a crumpled beige sweater with her hair tied back and no make-up, is talking to me from her home office and we both hear the pitter-patter of paws as Benji appears. I get a glimpse of a nose and two grey ears. 'He's like: 'I know you're talking about me,' ' laughs Adriene.
The five-year-old dog jumps up on the day bed behind Adriene, then changes his mind and saunters out. 'I don't know what I did to deserve this friendship,' Adriene says.
She met her business partner Chris Sharpe on the set of a film, and they decided to set up Yoga With Adriene on YouTube, posting the first videos in 2012.
'There wasn't much yoga online at that time, it was very much 'the guru passes it to the people',' she says. 'Going into this project, I had a fear of disrespecting yoga. I wanted my teachers to be proud of me.'
For this reason, she says, the initial videos concentrated on single positions. 'The first video I ever uploaded was Sukhasana, the seated, cross-legged pose. I do feel proud that that first video is entirely about learning to sit — which is relevant big-time now, all over the world.'
A huge 16 per cent of her subscribers are British. She says they found her online and that she met others when she did yoga roadshows in Manchester and London in 2016 and 2018.
'I did classes in an old boxing gym in London's Bethnal Green and we had another with about 2,400 people in Alexandra Palace,' she remembers.
'I've got a lot of friends in the UK and they say people like Yoga With Adriene because there's a bit of self-deprecating humour going on, like little silly jokes about creaky floors.'
One reason for her success is that she seems so unpretentious. Having recently taken some of her classes, I can testify that she comes across as authoritative, with a calm presence. It feels like exercising with a friend because she is so warm.
With other virtual yoga classes, I've tied myself in knots trying to look at the teacher and do the positions simultaneously. With Adriene I rarely had to look at the screen because you can achieve the poses mostly just by listening to her.
I like the 'shopping list' aspect of her videos, too. During the current health crisis there are days when people feel OK and others when they feel anxious. There are classes to suit all our many moods.
She nods. 'A lot of people think you have to do it one way — like 'I'm an ashtanga yogi' or 'I only do vinyasa'. But that, for me, has never made sense. We are not the same people from day to day spiritually, mentally and physically. That's why I love the mantra 'find what feels good'.
'Everything isn't going to feel good all the time, but it's about your willingness to stay curious and be present with what you're feeling today.'
Her yoga for beginners workout has 28 million views, so she seems to have found a way of teaching that people can relate to.
'I wouldn't be at the place I am now if I hadn't done the studies and tried everything from bikram to binyasa,' she says, naming two yoga disciplines.
But, she adds: 'I'm influenced by an acting training called the Suzuki Method and its sister training called The Viewpoints.
'It's about being present in one moment and allowing it to flow to the next and about breath control and voice, so there's a lot of crossover.'
I was surprised to see that she broadcasts yoga videos for weight loss — a big claim. Intense styles of yoga help you burn the most calories, but restorative yoga is not especially physical and I would not expect to lose weight with it.
Her business partner suggested the weight-loss series to help the videos rise through search rankings, I discover.
'I don't dread this question like I used to,' Adriene says. 'I'm grateful for the chance to speak.
'I used to say to my team , 'let's take this out as we're at the point where we don't need it. We've got millions of subscribers'.
'But, looking at the numbers, the difference between a video that says 'weight-loss' versus anything else is unbelievable. What it tells me is there are many people who want to lose weight and they're struggling. Maybe they could be supported more by the practice I'm sharing.
'If I were to remove those videos, all the people searching for yoga for weight loss are going to find videos that might not make them feel so supported. I've seen those videos and I don't think they're healthy.'
Her numbers in this area are staggering. There are 24 videos in the weight-loss series and the top four are her fat-burning workout (8.9 million), her total body workout (3.1 million), her health energy flow workout (3.3 million) and hips and abs (3.6 million).
'I keep them up so people can find us and hear that it's OK to create some changes, but you have to know why. What's the point of losing weight or having toned muscles if you're still looking in the mirror and you don't love who you see?'
These days, she makes money through advertising revenue on YouTube and has a growing number of subscribers who pay $9.99 a month (around £8), which helps subsidise her 600 free videos. She is also writing a book and developing a travel show.
When not working, she also sees her boyfriend regularly — lockdown rules in Texas are not as stringent as in other parts of the U.S. He built a software company, then sold it and is now a writer. They only met six months ago but she says happily: 'He's a doll, I'm very lucky.'
For those of us without Adriene's years of practice (and flexibility) but perhaps hoping to make yoga a habit during lockdown, she is typically encouraging. You can even practise it in your pyjamas, Adriene points out — the hardest part of the practise is showing up.
'I also think it's OK to have fun during these difficult times,' she says. 'There's yoga for loneliness if you need it, but it's also OK to have fun on that mat or towel and to welcome the light moments. They can be really healing.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Want that K-pop idol body? Follow these workouts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MANILA, Philippines – K-pop stars impress their fans not only with their spot-on dancing and sensational singing but also with their fit bodies.
Here are some workouts that idols do to stay in shape:
Momo of TWICE
The Japanese is not just known for being one of the best dancers among K-pop idols, she is also popular for her toned abs.
Momo recommends doing 50 plank hip dips 3 times a day with sit-ups on the side.
Although Momo loves eating – with her motto being "If I work hard, I can eat delicious things" – she compensates for her huge appetite by remaining fit.
Jungkook of BTS
For the most in-demand boy group in the world, BTS always needs to be in top shape to fulfill all of its commitments.
Jungkook, for example, follows a rigorous exercise routine.
The maknae of the seven-member act does squats, push-ups, jump squats, pike push-ups, planks, mountain climbers, burpees, crunches, leg raises, and Superman exercises in his workout.
Girls' Generation
From Taeyeon to Tiffany to Seohyun, Girls' Generation is considered body goals.
Members of SNSD were known for having slim legs, which is largely thanks to their 5:3:2 exercise that is said to result in the "golden ratio" of thigh, calf, and shin.
The 5:3:2 leg workout includes jumping jacks, high knees, and leg kicks.
SEVENTEEN
Working out can be challenging, so doing it with a partner might make the task a little less burdensome.
Just look at SEVENTEEN members DK and Seungkwan, who bond through exercising at their own dorm.
The two vocalists do planks, side planks, mountain climbers, burpees, push-ups, crunches, and jogging. – Rappler.com

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr ‘unheard’ track going under the hammer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An unheard track by Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Ringo Starr recorded after the Beatles split is heading for auction.
Angel In Disguise could be the only song co-written exclusively by the band’s former bassist and drummer, according to auctioneers.
The ex-Beatles recorded the demo for Sir Ringo’s 1992 solo album Time Takes Time but it did not make the cut.
Former Radio Luxembourg DJ Tony Prince is selling the cassette, which is expected to fetch up to £20,000.
He was asked to find artists to record alternative versions of Angel In Disguise in the 1990s, after Sir Ringo rejected the track.
The song has never been heard publicly.
Auctioneer Paul Fairweather said: “It’s fantastic to be able to bring to the market a previously unheard and unreleased track…
“We think the track certainly had enough about it to be included in the album and I am sure if Paul was to release this himself it would certainly prove a hit with fans.”
The cassette contains two versions of the track – a rough demo with Sir Paul  on vocals and a fuller ‘mixed’ version with musicians and backing vocals and Sir Ringo singing.
Another Sir Ringo demo, Everyone Wins, which was also shelved but later released on a compilation recording, is also included on the tape.
The tape, with other memorabilia, will go under the hammer at Omega Auctions’ online sale on May 19, with 25% of proceeds donated to the NHS Charities Together Covid-19 Urgent Appeal.

The Beatles announced their split in 1970, shortly before the release of their twelfth studio album, Let It Be.
Speaking on SiriusXM's The Howard Stern Show in March, Sir Paul spoke candidly about the end of the world's most successful group. 
When asked why he didn't keep the band together after Lennon announced his departure, he said:  'When families break up, it's to do with the emotion and the emotional pain.
'You can't just think of a smart idea like that at the time. You're hurting too much so it wasn't going to happen.'

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Around the world, people are isolating and practising social distancing, but it is not stopping them from having fun and spreading cheer, like a group of neighbours in a UK locality who decided to perform bhangra.
A video is doing rounds across social media platforms and is warming hearts online. While social distancing amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the group of people were seen performing basic steps of the Indian folk dance outside their homes.
Bhangra is a type of traditional dance from the Indian subcontinent, originating in the Majha area of Punjab.
Reportedly, the video was first shared by Twitter user Eeshar Singh, @shergillj99, who is part of the clip. News magazine India Today reported that Singh started dancing and others joined in, imitating his poses from a distance.
According to Singh's Facebook bio, it seems that the clip is from Leeds, UK.
The group performed to the Punjabi song, ‘Veervaar’ from the movie 'Sardaar Ji' by the artist Diljit Dosanjh.
“Mum got me dancing for the street,” he wrote online sharing the clip.
Performers were also seen playing the dhol in the clip.
The dancing skills have impressed many online, including singer-actor Diljit Dosanjh the original artist in the film, who retweeted the video online. Many also appreciated that people from different cultural backgrounds joined in and imitated the moves.
Twitter user @lxzettexo wrote: "It warmed my heart seeing other people of other cultures join. Thanks
Tweep @jmanderuk posted: "Love this, wish their was more of this community spirit and cross culture happiness in the world."
User @OneFurrowedBrow could not get enough of the performance: "Why is this only 45 seconds short?"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Emerging culture critics announced for the Herald and The Age</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age have selected five emerging culture critics after receiving funding from the Copyright Agency and the Judith Neilson Institute for Journalism and Ideas.
The grant will enable up to 100 extra pieces of critical writing across literature, visual arts and theatre in 2020.
The books critics are Bec Kavanagh and Jack Callil, who will write for both mastheads. The visual arts critics are Chloe Wolifson (Sydney) and Tiarney Miekus (Melbourne), while Cassie Tongue will cover theatre for the Herald.
While the present coronavirus-induced shutdown has decimated much of the arts and culture industry and forced theatres and art galleries to close, it provides the writers with an opportunity to produce other critical pieces and highlight areas of innovation during this once-in-a-generation crisis.
Kavanagh is a Melbourne-based writer who has been published in The Australian and Meanjin.
"I'm looking forward to sinking my teeth into some great new stories, and writing into a space that values the contributions of writers and the arts – particularly at this time," she said.
Callil is digital editor at the Australian Book Review and a proofreader at Meanjin.
"Having the opportunity to write about Australia’s vibrant and diverse literary community is an exceptional privilege," he said.
Wolifson has previously written for the Herald and The Guardian and has a monthly column in Art Monthly Australasia.
"It's always my hope that a review I've written encourages readers to go and view the exhibition themselves and engage with the work. I'm excited for this opportunity to start more conversations about Australian contemporary art," she said.
Miekus is a Melbourne-based writer and editor of Art Guide Australia. She has a strong interest in contemporary art and plays in a post-punk band.
"It's both humbling and exciting to be a contributing voice on visual arts, and to have the space, time and support to think intently and purposefully on visual art," she said.
Tongue has had regular theatre reviews published in Time Out and The Guardian.
"I'm looking forward to writing about new Australian performance as it happens: exploring new trends, engaging deeply with what our artists have to say, and giving thoughtful responses to the work of theatre-makers and performers who might otherwise miss out on coverage," she said.
Copyright Agency chief executive Adam Suckling said the five new critics will bring "important new voices to the landscape of arts criticism and review in Australia".
"The current crisis has shown just how fragile and important Australian writing and visual arts practice is," Mr Suckling said.
"While things are very grim for creators at the moment, the new critics will look at ways of covering Australian creativity during this terrible crisis. But they will also be in place for when, and I hope this is very soon, it is safe for Australian audiences to return to physical book launches, plays and shows at galleries."
Matthew Burgess, culture editor at the Herald and The Age, said he was "thrilled" to welcome the five new critics to the mastheads after an impressive number of applications.
"It is an exciting opportunity for our readers to gain fresh perspectives in visual arts, stage and books criticism," he said. "Our thanks to the Copyright Agency and the Judith Neilson Institute for supporting this important project."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Apprentice star Lottie Lion apologises after Lord Sugar 'racist' comments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Apprentice has had its fair share of big personalities, but you'd be hard pressed to find one who could outmatch the controversial Lottie Lion.
Lottie, who's only 20 years old, made her mark among last year's contenders and had accusations of racism levelled against her.
Now she's found herself in hot water again after her impression of Venezuelan born team mate Jemelin Artigas stoked some considerable backlash.
Jemelin, who's clashed with Lottie before, shared a video sent to her on her own Twitter, in which Lottie and contestant Ryan-Mark Parson take part in an Instagram Live.
Lottie mocks Jemelin's accent while Ryan-Mark laughs along.
She added, in her own voice: "It's like, darling, we all started from nothing - I started from nothing."
Lottie went on to say: "If we're going to talk about f**king racists, let's talk about Lord Sugar!
"He's an actual racist!"
Mirror Online have gone to Lord Sugar's rep for comment.
Lottie and Ryan-Mark have since apologised over her impersonation, telling MailOnline : "We impersonated various candidates from The Apprentice on our Instagram Live on Friday.
"We are aware one candidate has taken offence and can only apologise."
On social media she had previously defended her comments as "light entertainment" rather than anything meant to hurt.
"Doing these impressions of The Apprentice candidates last night was meant to be some light entertainment for my fans during these difficult times ," she tweeted.
"I am aware that an individual HAS taken offence, and I can only apologise."
Nor has Jemelin been silent on the matter, sharing a string of tweets explaining her position.
She branded Lottie "the biggest racist" and accused the pair of being "pathetic" after Lottie issued her apology tweet.
However, she retweeted Ryan-Mark's apology and wrote: "I will always appreciate people taking responsibility so thank you @ryanmarkparsons and even though I know some not so nice things have been said.
"I appreciate you apologising so thank you."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Apprentice has had its fair share of big personalities, but you'd be hard pressed to find one who could outmatch the controversial Lottie Lion.
Lottie, who's only 20 years old, made her mark among last year's contenders and had accusations of racism levelled against her.
Now she's found herself in hot water again after her impression of Venezuelan born team mate Jemelin Artigas stoked some considerable backlash.
Jemelin, who's clashed with Lottie before, shared a video sent to her on her own Twitter, in which Lottie and contestant Ryan-Mark Parson take part in an Instagram Live.
Lottie mocks Jemelin's accent while Ryan-Mark laughs along.
She added, in her own voice: "It's like, darling, we all started from nothing - I started from nothing."
Lottie went on to say: "If we're going to talk about f**king racists, let's talk about Lord Sugar!
"He's an actual racist!"
Lord Sugar's rep declined to comment when approached by Mirror Online.
Lottie and Ryan-Mark have since apologised over her impersonation, telling MailOnline : "We impersonated various candidates from The Apprentice on our Instagram Live on Friday.
"We are aware one candidate has taken offence and can only apologise."
On social media she had previously defended her comments as "light entertainment" rather than anything meant to hurt.
"Doing these impressions of The Apprentice candidates last night was meant to be some light entertainment for my fans during these difficult times ," she tweeted.
"I am aware that an individual HAS taken offence, and I can only apologise."
Nor has Jemelin been silent on the matter, sharing a string of tweets explaining her position.
She branded Lottie "the biggest racist" and accused the pair of being "pathetic" after Lottie issued her apology tweet.
However, she retweeted Ryan-Mark's apology and wrote: "I will always appreciate people taking responsibility so thank you @ryanmarkparsons and even though I know some not so nice things have been said.
"I appreciate you apologising so thank you."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Madonna attends birthday party after testing positive for coronavirus antibodies</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Madonna made sure she didn't miss out on a friend's birthday party, despite recently testing positive for coronavirus antibodies.
The Like A Virgin singer, 61, attended the bash in person and even hugged and presented her pal Steven Klein with a cake to mark his 55th birthday.
No one at the birthday bash was wearing any protective gear like face masks, despite the worldwide coronavirus crisis.
Madonna's positive test means she has recently been in contact with Covid-19.
Klein's birthday party was livestreamed on the video chatting app Zoom meaning guests could attend it virtually, but defiant Madge was there in person.
One of the people who attended shared a video of Madonna hugging Klein.
They captioned the post: "M made an appearance at Steven Klein's Virtual Birthday Party - such a blast!!
"M called his Bday cake a Covid Cake.
"She's too f**king cute!!! We are living in some crazy tiMes!
"But trying to make the most of it, and still have soMe fun!!! [sic]"
Mirror Online has contacted Madonna's reps for comment.
Madonna took to Instagram to reveal she'd tested positive for the coronavirus antibodies earlier this week.
"Took a test the other day, and I found out that I have the antibodies," she said.
"So tomorrow, I'm just going to go for a long drive in the car… and I'm going to breathe in the COVID-19 air.
"Yep. I hope the sun is shining."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Chase fans in disbelief over contestant's likeness to Emmerdale legend</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Viewers tuning into The Chase's family special on Sunday, called The Family Chase, were left stunned by one contestant.
Those watching the ITV gameshow dubbed her a lookalike of a former Emmerdale legend.
Viewers thought contestant Paula looked so much like the character in particular, that they began calling her by said character's name.
Emmerdale fans were quick to spot she looked remarkably like Val Pollard.
Val was married to Eric Pollard in the Dales, before her tragic death in 2015 during the helicopter stunt.
She was played by actress Charlie Hardwick since 2004.
As Paula appeared on The Chase on Sunday, fans spotted the huge resemblance between her and the actress who played Val.
From the hair colour to the matching style, and even the Geordie accent, fans couldn't believe their eyes.
One viewer said: "Seat 2  #TheChase," with an image of Val leading to many others agreeing.
Another fan agreed: "Val up now! #TheChase."
A third said: "Now it's Val from Emmerdale  #Thefamilychase."
Unfortunately, like her sister who went before her, Paula was caught by the Chaser, Paul Sinha, and sent home.
As her departure aired, one fan tweeted: "That was too f***ing easy. Now do one back to the Woolpack, Val."
A second fan hoped she might return for the final chase, and said: "Go low & bring Val back oot!"
Unfortunately, it was just Hannah left to play in the final round and she and the family did not win the cash prize.
The Chase airs weeknights at 5pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Who will take Holly Willoughby's spot on Celebrity Juice?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Now that Holly Willoughby had opted to leave Celebrity Juice, the show needs a new team captain.
With no official word on who will fill Holly's shoes, fans are busy speculating as to who will be baring the brunt of Keith Lemon's most outrageous gags.
Holly did just that for 12 years, having been a team captain since the show got off the ground way back in 2008 - but who will take her place?
The biggest theories are below...
The Corrie and Our Girl star is probably the front runner right now.
Both Michelle and hunky husband Mark Wright have made appearances on the show, and both were a hit with fans.
Bookies Ladbrokes are backing her too, a spokesman saying: "Michelle Keegan's no stranger to Celebrity Juice and she could soon become a permanent fixture if the latest odds are anything to go by."
She's also hung up her helmet on Our Girl, so she could have some space open in her diary...
Gogglebox original Scarlett Moffatt has also been floated by fans.
She's also appeared on the show, and proved a popular panellist.
Ladbrokes reckon she's a solid bet, and fans know from Gogglebox she's got the comedy chops to stand her own ground.
Inbetweeners star Emily went through a surge in popularity after her I'm A Celebrity stint in 2018.
She's since become an ITV staple, with This Morning appearances and a hosting gig on I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp.
Emily's appeared fairly recently on Celebrity Juice, and sent Keith into overdrive by sharing a kiss with Spice Girl Mel B.
Kelly and Keith must be close mates by now - she's turned up on the show, and even starred in his film, aptly named Keith Lemon: The Movie.
She's already got her radio show so her diary's pretty busy, but if her recent Bake Off stint proved anything it's that she can keep fans entertained.
Her rapport with pal Keith is already well established in fans' minds, so she won't take much introduction.
The Italian chef is another ITV staple, and no stranger to speaking his mind.
During his This Morning appearances, when he cooks with Holly and Phillip Schofield, he's become legendary for his brutal honesty and scathing criticism.
He's been busy with Gordon Ramsay and Fred Sirieix on their show Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip, so it's uncertain how much freedom he'll have.
He'd certainly clash with Keith...

She's also hung up her helmet on Our Girl, so she could have some space open in her diary...
Gogglebox original Scarlett Moffatt has also been floated by fans.
She's also appeared on the show, and proved a popular panellist.
Ladbrokes reckon she's a solid bet, and fans know from Gogglebox she's got the comedy chops to stand her own ground.
Inbetweeners star Emily went through a surge in popularity after her I'm A Celebrity stint in 2018.
She's since become an ITV staple, with This Morning appearances and a hosting gig on I'm A Celebrity: Extra Camp.
Emily's appeared fairly recently on Celebrity Juice, and sent Keith into overdrive by sharing a kiss with Spice Girl Mel B.
Kelly and Keith must be close mates by now - she's turned up on the show, and even starred in his film, aptly named Keith Lemon: The Movie.
She's already got her radio show so her diary's pretty busy, but if her recent Bake Off stint proved anything it's that she can keep fans entertained.
Her rapport with pal Keith is already well established in fans' minds, so she won't take much introduction.
The Italian chef is another ITV staple, and no stranger to speaking his mind.
During his This Morning appearances, when he cooks with Holly and Phillip Schofield, he's become legendary for his brutal honesty and scathing criticism.
He's been busy with Gordon Ramsay and Fred Sirieix on their show Gordon, Gino and Fred: Road Trip, so it's uncertain how much freedom he'll have.
He'd certainly clash with Keith...

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gogglebox viewers rank the stars with one group taking nearly 40% of the vote</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gogglebox has become beloved by millions, and everyone has their favourites.
Fans recently took part in a poll that allowed them to put forward which of the 11 groups they reckoned deserved the honour of the top spot.
The poll, conducted by The Liverpool Echo, asked fans to order the stars based on how much they make them laugh - with one even stealing 39% of the vote.
Below are all 11 groups, ranked...
London family the Vens joined the show quite late, during season 11 in 2018.
Marcus, girlfriend Mica, and her two daughters Sachelle and Shuggy have become renowned for their bubbly personalities, fits of laughter, and on point honesty.
Mica provided a priceless fan favourite moment as they sat down to watch Victoria Coren Mitchell's notoriously tricky Only Connect, laughing: "This show isn't for the hood, man."
Dad Andrew, mum Carolyne and son Louis have been Gogglebox fixtures since the show first kicked off.
Their numbers have fluctuated, as twin sisters Alex and Catheryne seem to come and go as well.
The family have become best known for Andrew's uncompromising and often scathing wit, as he kicks back in that enormous armchair.
Brighton hairdresser Stephen first appeared on the show alongside then boyfriend Chris, before the pair went their separate ways.
He's since been joined by husband Daniel, as well as mum Pat for a stint.
Stephen is responsible for one of the most iconic Gogglebox moments.
As he and Chris watched the news, the latter observed: "We all like a bad boy, don't we?"
A stunned Stephen looks around and answers: "Not a f**king terrorist though, Chris!"
Dave and Shirley have been married for a staggering 40 years, filming the show from their home in Wales.
Joining the show in 2015, fans have learned that the pair have a genuine deep love for each other - but that won't stop them having a bicker now and again.
Ellie and Izzi stirred the pot recently when they made their feelings very clear about Boris Johnson.
Still, the Yorkshire sisters are mostly a light hearted pair, most often obsessing over food.
When they first put their names down for the show, they reckoned people wouldn't be interested in what they had to say.
The poll begs to differ...
Bristol besties Mary and Marina are completely unfiltered and they hold nothing back.
Both in their 80s, they film from a retirement home and have won legions of fans as their conversations go off on tangents.
Dad Sid and sons Baasit and Umar are well known for their no nonsense slams and quick wit.
The core three are often joined by other family members, like sister Raza and their mum.
The family of four have carved out a place as firm fan favourites, as have their Rottweilers.
The dogs can be seen having a nose about the place and often trying to swipe a biscuit or two when they think the family won't notice.
In fact, their snack collection has become the stuff of Gogglebox legend, with fans not convinced they ever eat them themselves.
Probably the quirkiest couple on the list, Giles and Mary will always have a place in fans' hearts.
The posh duo's home is instantly memorable, as are their lengthy and eloquent rants about whatever they're watching.
Coming in second place with 23% of the vote, brother and sister Pete and Sophie were string contenders for the top spot despite only arriving on the show in 2018.
The Blackpool pair have become renowned for mocking each other as much as they do the telly, so it's no surprise they've proved a hit with fans.
Taking the top spot are the iconic, the legendary, the one and only Jenny and Lee.
The caravan-based pair from Hull swept up a whopping 39% of the vote, landing them as the firm victors.
They first met when Jenny was a landlady and Lee was a pub regular, and have since struck up the sweetest - and funniest friendship.
Joining in 2014, it's not difficult to see why they've managed to place themselves at the top of the list.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mystery over Rob Kardashian and stunning British influencer Kenza Boutrif's new friendship</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rob Kardashian has just added stunning British model and influencer Kenza Boutrif to his Instagram following, taking the total up to 21.
The 33-year-old reality star set tongues wagging on social media after giving the UK-based model and social media star a follow over the weekend.
Rob's tiny following is usually reserved for his closest family and friends, such as his sisters Kourtney, Khloe and Kim Kardashian.
The reality star's unusual move came less than a week after he made a rare appearance on Keeping Up With The Kardashians to celebrate his daughter's birthday.
But what do we know about Rob's new social media friend?
Kenza Boutrif is a glamorous social media model that is represented by Wilhelmina Models.
She boasts an impressive following of 634,000 fans on Instagram and only follows 103 back - including Rob.
The well-travelled influencer boasts pictures taken in Dubai, New York and Los Angeles among her incredible collection of jet setting snaps and she was also at London Fashion Week earlier this year.
Among her stellar collection of pictures, she has also received plenty of approval from other popular UK reality stars.
Some of her pictures have been liked by Love Island stars Belle Hassan and Yewande Biala.
Kenza also has her own Depop page where she is selling plenty of designer goods such as Comme Des Garcons and a pair of Alexander McQueen trainers.
In the meantime, Rob is currently embroiled in a bitter fued with his ex-girlfriend and model Blac Chynna.
The former couple dated back in 2016 and their daughter was born just one month before their split was made official.
Since then, the volatile couple have been caught up in an ongoing and complicated custody battle over their Dream.
At the end of February 2020, a judge denied Rob's request to have primary custody over his daughter.
Both Rob and Kenza have been contacted for comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronation Street’s Peter Barlow will save Yasmeen from jail and expose Geoff’s lies say fans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CORRIE fans think Peter Barlow will save Yasmeen Nazir from prison after he notices she’s been showing some worrying behaviour.
It’s been a rollercoaster week on the cobbles as viewers have been left horrified by the abuse Yasmeen has experienced at the hands of her husband Geoff Metcalfe.
Fans watched from behind their cushions as Yasmeen finally snapped after months of terrifying abuse and stabbed Geoff in the neck with a broken wine bottle.
In spoilers for the long-running soap, it’s been revealed Yasmeen, played by Shelley King, will call the police be charged with attempted murder as street residents are left in shock at the news of the attack.
But fans think Peter, played by Chris Gascoyne, will come to her rescue and tell police he’s witnessed several displays of worrying behaviour from her.
One wrote: “…If you look in the last few episodes we had Sally, Eileen and Peter notice something wasn’t right but didn’t act. So maybe these are the people who will stick by Yasmeen.”
And another added: “i really hope peter and eileen are going to be allies to yasmeen in the coming weeks bc they seem to be the only people to have suspicions about geoff”
While a third guessed: “Calling for Peter being Yasmeen’s rescue…”
Earlier in the episode fans were horrified as Yasmeen was dragged out to the pub in a red dress that charmless Geoff had originally bought for a sex worker.
Geoff, played by Ian Bartholomew, took her to the Rovers to see Sally and Tim – before dropping the bombshell that he'd handed over her money to pay for their wedding.
Yasmeen was shocked that he'd handed over a fortune without consulting her, but Geoff barked: "You want to do this now? Get your coat. Shift. Don't you dare turn the waterworks on in here."
As she walked away from the bar the cameras lingered on Peter looking at her with concern, giving fans hope that he will realise something isn't adding up after Yasmeen's arrest
Away from prying eyes at No.6 viewers watched in horror as Geoff grabbed a knife and told Yasmeen: "Maybe I should kill you – do the world a favour. Would anyone really notice if you were gone?"
With that, she picked up a wine bottle and smashed abusive Geoff around the head before plunging the broken glass into his neck.
Peter has been keeping an eye on Yasmeen ever since Geoff told everyone she had a drinking problem earlier this year.
Fans are on the edge of their seats as they wait to see what happens, admitting they were “sucked in” by the plot.
One wrote: “I love when #corrie does episodes like this. They are just so well put together and engaging. Proper sucked in by this storyline of poor Yasmeen and they're going a fantastic job of it.”
Another added: “Lets go Yasmeen Thinking face Take that Geoff f**ker out preferably with a bullet bloody hard to watch #Corrie”
And a third wrote: “It was very disturbing to watch but i am glad that Yasmeen has fought back. However she will not deserve to be sent to prison for this, i hope tim, sally , peter and her friends will understand what has been going on. Think Eileen does. No one shoud go through that. Awful man”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Spoilers: Corrie boss reveals all on Yasmeen and Geoff ending</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There have been some difficult decisions to be made throughout the long running storyline arc of Geoff Metcalfe’s (Ian Bartholomew) campaign of coercive abuse against Yasmeen Nazir (Shelley King), according to Coronation Street boss Iain Macleod – but one thing he insists is that the recent twist that saw the horrific husband left for dead was planned for the start.
Viewers saw Geoff become more aggressive than ever and leave Yasmeen in terror of her life as he ranted horrific abuse and waved a knife in her face, suggesting it would be better for everyone if he just killed her.
In a relexive move to defend herself, a petrified Yasmeen stabbed Geoff in the neck and will be seen phoning the police to reveal that she has killed her husband.
It has been a deliberately slow paced story – and one that producer Iain admits has been the most debated over in the storyline office out of any plot.
He told Radio Times: ‘It’s been refined month by month in conjunction with our charity and research partners (including Women’s Aid). We’ve known pretty much from the start this incident would be one of the major peaks.
‘It’s been organically told and we’ve agonised over the advancement of how Geoff’s behaviour evolved.
‘It has been discussed in more detail than any other story I’ve worked on, just to make sure we get the nuance right.’
The storyline has come up for almost universal praise, with many in Yasmeen’s position having commended the show for its accurate portrayal of coercive control.
Iain added: ‘We don’t make it for this reason but it is important to have what I call good ‘drama karma’: what you’re putting on screen is karmically making the world little bit of a better place. I really think this story is.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Louis Theroux slices finger off making Jamie Oliver pancake recipe – and he still can’t find it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOUIS Theroux has managed to slice off part of his finger while trying his hand at making a pancake recipe by Jamie Oliver.
The hit documentary maker has risked his life over the years to make great TV but it seems an encounter with a sharp knife and a red onion has inflicted the most trauma.
Louis Theroux, 49, was trying his hand at a Jamie Oliver recipe for savoury pancakes on Saturday evening when the culinary catastrophe occurred.
The BBC filmmaker shared a photo of his finger heavily bandaged up and a devastated expression on his face to his Instagram followers.
In the caption Louis wrote: “Cut a small slice of my finger off while chopping a red onion for a Jamie Oliver recipe for carrot and coriander pancakes.
“Briefly went pale and had to lie down. Family not impressed by my lack of stoicism. Me too frankly. Still haven’t found the missing piece of finger.”
Celeb chef Jamie Oliver is yet to comment on the missing digit but Louis's other pals sent him comforting words, including
fellow BBC presenter and former One Show host Matt Baker, who joked: “I think the recipe says Ginger not Finger.”
Louis should be a dab hand in the kitchen after starring in BBC's Great Celebrity Bake Off where he had viewers in hysterics as he thrusted into the air during the Stand Up To Cancer special.
The broadcaster was also the first to secure the coveted Paul Hollywood handshake, before Prue Leith followed suit.
Louis then insisted comedian Noel Fielding shake his hand too, which Noel did so reluctantly, deadpanning: "This means nothing."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Louis Theroux ‘slices finger’ while trying Jamie Oliver pancake recipe</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Louis Theroux risked it all while trying his hand at a Jamie Oliver recipe this weekend and ended up ‘slicing off’ part of his finger in the process.
The BBC filmmaker got busy in the kitchen on Saturday night and decided to try one of Jamie’s quirky recipes for savoury pancakes. 
However, it all ended in bloodshed with Louis, 49, sharing a photo of his poor finger bandaged up and a devastated expression on his face. 
‘Cut a small slice of my finger off while chopping a red onion for a Jamie Oliver recipe for carrot and coriander pancakes,’ Louis revealed to his Instagram followers. 
‘Briefly went pale and had to lie down. Family not impressed by my lack of stoicism. Me too frankly. Still haven’t found the missing piece of finger.’ 
While Jamie is yet to respond to Louis’ kitchen nightmare, the documentarian’s followers had plenty to say. 
Former One Show host Matt Baker joked: ‘I think the recipe says Ginger not Finger.’ 
‘That’s the universe’s way of saying you should stick with the lasagne,’ quipped another of Louis’ followers. 
Keen to avoid the recipe themselves, one added: ‘Reasons why not to make carrot and coriander pancakes number 26.’ 
Another fan cried: ‘For Gods sake Louis, stop cooking!!!!’ 
It’s safe to say he’ll probably be ordering take out more often going forward. 
Aside from creating a mess in the kitchen, Louis also opened up about his past interview with Tiger King’s Joe Exotic. 
The pair met in 2011 for Louis’ BBC documentary America’s Most Dangerous Pets before Joe became the single most talked about man on the planet following the Netflix series. 
‘I knew him before he was famous,’ Louis said on The Graham Norton Show. 
‘I spent the best part of a week with him for a documentary on dangerous pets in 2011.’ ‘If I have any regrets, it’s not talking to him more about his two husbands and his rules of engagement for three-person love making!’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Antiques Roadshow sees James Bond hat valued at £30k</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Antiques Roadshow shocked tonight as a James Bond bowler hat struck gold for a 007 fan with an impressive £30k valuation.
The battered accessory, which used to deadly effect by infamous hitman Oddjob (played by Harold Sakata) in the 1964 film Goldfinger, was part of a collection of James Bond memorabilia brought to the show when it filmed at the National Botanic Garden of Wales last summer.
Expert Marc Allum was seriously impressed by the treasures – including a number plate – and branded them as an ‘iconic part of Bond history.’
Looking at the items, Allum enthused: ‘I’m shaking with anticipation and excitement. This, I think, is an amazingly iconic collection of objects and an amazing story too.’
The owner admitted he was a huge fan of the franchise as a child and his brother-in-law, who was a driver for Aston Martin during the filming of Goldfinger, asked Pinewood Studios if they had any memorabilia.
The studio gave him Oddjob’s bowler hat but insisted the metal rim was taken out before it was handed over – with disastrous consequences.
‘As a young lad, everybody wanted to throw the Oddjob hat, and if you look at it, everybody did throw the hat because it’s absolutely in pieces because it didn’t have the steel in it anymore, so therefore whenever it landed it damaged it,’ they said.
Despite the damage, Marc valued the bowler hat between £20k-30k and the 007 number plate, which was used by Aston Martin to promote the film but never appeared on screen, at £4-6k.
Although the owner of the collection said the items would be safely stowed away, he did express an interest in selling them.
Over the years Antiques Roadshow has valued several James Bond items including a jacket worn by Daniel Craig in Casino Royale valued at £3-5k, a watch used in The World is Not Enough valued at £15-20k, and a first edition of The Man With The Golden Gun valued at £1.2-£1.5k.
Antiques Roadshow airs tonight at 7.15pm on BBC One.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bond villain's hat goes up for auction on Antiques Roadshow for thousands</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Oddjob’s deadly bowler hat in the 007 film ­Goldfinger has made a ­surprise appearance on the BBC’s Antiques Roadshow.
The battered steel-rimmed hat was one of those thrown by actor and Olympic weightlifter Harold Sakata in the 1964 film, and valued at up to £30,000.
It was part of a collection of James Bond memorabilia brought to the show when it filmed at the National Botanic Garden of Wales last summer.
The hat, together with a 007 number plate, left Roadshow expert Marc Allum amazed.
He called them an “iconic part of Bond history”, adding: “I’m shaking with excitement.”
The owner said he was a huge 007 fan as a child and his brother-in-law was a driver for Aston Martin during the filming of Goldfinger, starring Sean Connery as Bond and Gert Frobe as the baddie.
He asked for memorabilia and Pinewood Studios gave him Oddjob’s bowler hat but insisted the metal rim be taken out before it was handed over as it was too dangerous.
He said: “As a young lad, everybody wanted to throw the Oddjob hat, and if you look at it, everybody did throw the hat because it’s absolutely in pieces because it didn’t have the steel in it any more, so therefore whenever it landed it damaged it.”
Despite the damage, Marc valued the flat-crowned bowler at £20,000 to £30,000 and the 007 number plate, which was used by Aston Martin to promote the film but never appeared on screen, at £4,000 to £6,000.
The owner of the collection said they would be stowed away, but he would be interested in selling them.
Over the years, Antiques Roadshow has valued several James Bond items including a jacket worn by Daniel Craig in Casino Royale at £3,000-£5,000 and a watch used in The World is Not Enough valued at £15,000-£20,000.

Controversial self-styled investigative journalist, Kemi Olunloyo, joined other celebrities who took to social media to congratulate Davido’s fiancee, Chioma, as she marked her birthday Thursday.
However, Kemi, in her birthday message to Chioma, couldn’t resist shading the mother-of-one as she reminded her of the Porsche car she got from Davido as her birthday gift back in 2018.
Kemi Olunloyo also reminded her of the cooking show where she signed a deal for two years, and which is yet to officially kick-off.
According to her, the cooking show and Porsche car are all “audio”, as they were only heard about but not seen.
She wrote:  “Happy birthday Chioma. Audio cooking show nko? You announced two years ago today? 2018 Porsche nko? Have you gotten your driver’s license?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Casualty episode scrapped by BBC over Covid-19 - but fans want missing episode</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans of medical drama Casualty want a missing episode made available on BBC iPlayer.
The episode was due to be shown this weekend but was scrapped by the BBC due to 'inappropriate' content during the current coronavirus pandemic.
An announcement before last night's instalment said: "The episode we were due to watch tonight, filmed before the spread of Covid-19, was considered inappropriate to show at the moment."
The episode that aired on Saturday night instead included a short catch-up that filled viewers in on scenes from the major storylines that they will have missed due to the transmission of the preceding instalment being skipped.
The announcer continued before it started: "But never fear. everything we need to know from that episode is in a catch up right at the start of the programme."
However, the short recap before this weekend's episode wasn't enough for some fans, who have now taken to social media calling for the BBC to make the missing instalment available on their catch-up service, BBC iPlayer.
One fan wrote on Twitter : "I assumed I’d missed one so checked iPlayer but no. Turns out the BBC decided to cut it!
"Please put it on iPlayer so I can decide whether to watch it!!"
Another disappointed viewer commented: "Can't they just put it on iplayer then? Gives people a choice on whether they want to watch or not! #casualty "
Elsewhere, a third Casualty fan commented: "That missing episode of #Casualty looks great. Bonkers decision not to show it.
"I understand the reasoning but I disagree with it."
Another Twitter user thought the missing episode could have helped give some viewers a realistic look at what we're all currently facing.
They tweeted: "Deemed inappropriate? Maybe show the episode and give people the reality check they need to keep them in the bloody house #casualty."
Finally, one Casualty viewer concluded: "Hope they put the missing episode on iPlayer.
"I get they didn't want to show it and the white suits on the preview suggest a virus situation but I still wanna watch it! We've missed a massive Marty storyline! #Casualty "
Regardless of whether the BBC do eventually make the episode available to fans, Casualty will now be on a break until May 23 when it will return with its next episode.
Casualty returns to BBC One later this month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Casualty fans confused as BBC skips an 'inappropriate episode'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Casualty viewers were confused last night when the BBC skipped an episode it called "inappropriate".
Fans had been expecting to watch a gripping episode culminating with a showdown between Ethan and Will - but instead it was replaced by a catch-up and the following week's episode.
The extended preview at the start was designed to fill in the gaps on what fans would've seen in the axed episode.
A voiceover announcer said: "The episode we were due to watch tonight, filmed before the spread of COVID-19, was considered inappropriate to show at the moment.
"But never fear, everything we need to know from that episode is in a catch-up right at the start of the programme."

However glimpses of the episode from the preview showed characters dressed in full protective gear, suggesting an epidemic style storyline.
Such a plot would too closely mirror real life events with the current pandemic.
But that didn't stop fans being confused about what was going on.
And they were still desperate to see the missing episode.
One said: "Really, really disappointed at the missing episode of #Casualty, especially when it’s so pivotal to current storylines.
"The showdown between Will and Ethan would have been great to see 😢 #Casualty @BBCCasualty"
A second said: "#casualty I would have liked to have seen that episode."
A third said: "I really wanted to see the episode that they skipped #Casualty."
It comes after BBC controller Piers Wenger admitted Casualty is unlikely to resume filming soon.
Speaking at an Edinburgh TV Festival online Q&A, he said: "We do have to abide by the rules and while social distancing is in place it is going to be difficult.

"There are ways of cheating, actors being close enough together to interact in a scene."
He added: "We’re not quite at that point yet.
"But all of those conversation are being had and there is a real determination to get that show back up and running."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Little Mix star Jesy Nelson has continued her lockdown ritual of showing off her huge array of stunning outfits to fans.
Sunday's offering included big white trainers, ripped blue jeans and a loose fitting beige crop top that hung off the shoulder.
The 28 year old completed her ensemble with a black and white bucket hat.
It gave Jesy the chance to show off her incredible washboard abs, with starstruck fans flooding to the comments section.
"Girl u are fire," one gushed.
Another wrote: "Oh woooowwwwwww Jess."
A third just penned: "HAWWWWWTTTT."
"You look so stunning," a fourth fawned, while another told Jesy she'd made their Sunday.
Jesy is newly single after splitting from Love Island star Chris Hughes as they self-isolated seperately.
She seems in good spirits despite the breakup, sharing her thoughts on how "the simple things make your heart happy" as she danced in the woods with BFF and new roomie Charlotte Driver.
Meanwhile, Little Mix have been forced to call off their summer tour amid the coronavirus crisis.
The girls - Jesy, Perrie Edwards, Leigh-Anne Pinnock and Jade Thirlwall - told on Twitter : "We are so sad to announce that following the latest government advice, we have had to cancel our upcoming summer tour.
"The health and safety of all our fans and crew is always our number one priority..."
The tour had been set for a June start date, playing across the country including in London's Hyde Park in July.
It was supposed to run into August.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marli Alexa Lets It All Hang Out In A Black String Bikini On Instagram</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Amanda Lynne
Marli Alexa took to her Instagram account on Saturday night to share yet another steamy photo of herself. The model showed off her enviable curves while enjoying an adult beverage.
In the sexy snap, Marli looked smoking hot as she rocked a black string bikini. The skimpy top tied around her neck and behind her back while showcasing her toned arms and shoulders. The low cut of the garment also flaunted her ample cleavage.
The matching bikini bottoms laced over her curvy hips and accentuated her round booty and killer legs. Her flat tummy and rock hard abs can also be seen in the shot. She accessorized the look with a gold chain and pendant around her neck.
She leaned over a kitchen counter with a drink in her hand. She arched her back and rested both of her arms on the counter top as she gave a seductive stare into the camera.
Marli wore her long, blond hair parted in the center and styled in loose waves. She pinned her bangs back as her locks fell down her back and rippled over her shoulder.
She also opted for a full face of makeup in the pic. The application consisted of thick lashes and black eyeliner. She added pink eye shadow and sculpted brows to further define her features.
She complemented her tanned skin with pink blush on the apples of her cheeks and a shimmering highlighter on her forehead and under eyes. She completed the glam look with dark pink lipstick.
Marli’s 504,000-plus followers went wild for the steamy snap, clicking the like button more than 32,000 times within the first 14 hours after it was published to her account. Fans also flooded the comments section with over 680 messages.
“Super sexy picture and a beautiful woman,” one follower wrote.
“You have amazing eyes and [a] beautiful body,” another stated.
“A beautiful and sexy goddess,” a third social media user gushed.
“Woow you’re an angel, so freackin [sic] gorgeous… I love your eyes,” a fourth comment read.
Marli appears to have no qualms about showing off her petite figure in sexy ensembles for her online photos. She’s often seen rocking scanty bathing suits, tiny shorts, and plunging tops.
As previously reported by The Inquisitr, Marli dropped the jaws of her followers earlier this week when she posed in a neon pink string bikini top that exposed her cleavage. That photo also proved to be popular among fans. To date, the post has raked in more than 25,000 likes and over 400 comments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Romeo Beckham, 17, celebrates first anniversary with girlfriend despite lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Romeo Beckham has celebrated his first anniversary with girlfriend Mia Regan with some cute snaps.
The 17-year-old son of David and Victoria Beckham is currently separated from his girlfriend due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Romeo is currently staying with his parents and younger siblings, Cruz Beckham and Harper Seven Beckham.
The family celebrated patriarch David's 45th birthday on Saturday with some rather cute tributes, but now Romeo has his own milestone to mark.
The lad posted a selection of throwback snaps with Mia, who is also known by Mimi Moocher.
The pics came with the caption: "Happy 1 year mooch love u so much @mimimoocher."
Meanwhile, Mimi posted her own tribute to her boyfriend from afar.
The photo of the pair snuggling up came with the caption: "Special times more to come."
Romeo has previously shared an insight into the pair's Valentine's Day trip to Paris earlier this year.
The pair posed for a mirror selfie together and visited the legendary Louvre museum.
Rumours of a romance between Romeo and his lady-love were seemingly confirmed when Mimi attended a private family dinner with Romeo to celebrate Victoria's Fashion Week show.
Meanwhile, Romeo isn't the only Beckham kid to be loved-up.
Older brother Brooklyn Beckham, 21, is currently residing in the US with his actress girlfriend, Nicola Peltz.
Unlike Romeo, Brooklyn is separated from his family as he remains in lockdown with his partner.
That didn't stop Brooklyn from sending dad David his own sweet birthday message on Saturday, however.
Brooklyn shared a throwback photo of him with his father, writing on the Instagram post: "Happy birthday to the best dad in the world x you are my best friend and I love you. @davidbeckham."
Elsewhere, Romeo's own tribute to his footballer Dad read: "Happy birthday dad I love you so so so so much and hope you have the best day. Sorry for being officially taller than you now."
We're sure David is proud of all his boys - and not forgetting little Harper Seven, too!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Romeo Beckham celebrates first anniversary with girlfriend Mia Regan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Romeo Beckham is clearly a charmer like his father as he showered his girlfriend, Mia Regan, with all the love in celebration of their first anniversary this weekend. 
The 17-year-old was feeling very sentimental as he shared cute photos of them together from the past year and it seems the honeymoon phase isn’t over just yet. 
‘Happy 1 year mooch love u so much,’ Romeo captioned the Instagram post. 
Romeo’s aunt and David Beckham’s sister Joanne had all the feels over Romeo’s sweet sentiments and commented: ‘Oh my god this is the cutest ever 😍 happy one year guys ❤️.’ 
Although they’re celebrating their one-year anniversary now, the young lovebirds were only linked back in September 2019 when Mia was spotted with Romeo at his mum Victoria Beckham’s London Fashion Week showcase. They kept it lowkey during the runway show but were spotted sitting together during the family dinner at Harry’s Bar in Mayfair later that evening. 
In November 2019, Megan then wished Romeo a happy birthday on Instagram to which he replied: ‘Happy b day Mooch. Hope you have a lovely day xxxx p.s. loving the glasses,’ making their relationship Instagram official. 
Since then, it’s been a whirlwind romance for Megan and Romeo, who whisked the model off to Paris – the city of love – for a romantic weekend in December. They took in all the sights, including the Louvre, the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, while also hanging out with friends. 
Mia also joined Romeo and his family as his dad David launched his new football team Inter Miami CF in March. 
At the moment though, the couple appear to be separated by the coronavirus lockdown with Romeo self-isolating with his parents Victoria and David, and siblings Cruz and Harper in the UK, while older brother Brooklyn remains in the US with his girlfriend Nicola Peltz.
The family enjoyed even more celebrations as retired footballer David celebrated his 45th birthday. 
Romeo posted a celebratory message to his old man, which read: ‘Happy birthday dad I love you so so so so much and hope you have the best day ♥️sorry for being officially taller than you now.’ 
David quipped back: ‘It’s all because the ManBun.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rebel Wilson Rocks See-Through Mesh Shirt & Shows Off Dance Moves For TikTok Challenge</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It truly feels like TikTok is taking over the world! Some of our favorite celebrities have been posting hilarious videos on the app — and Rebel Wilson is no exception. The Aussie actress took to the social media platform on May 3 to share a funny clip of herself starting a duet fight. The 40-year-old Pitch Perfect star’s dance challenge was set to the tune of Shakira‘s hit “Hips Don’t Lie”, and she encouraged her fans to get in on the fun. “Duet me on TikTok if you dare! Let’s see who is victorious!,” she captioned the clip.
The duet function on the video sharing app allows users to take another person’s video and add to it their own clip, either reacting to it, or recreating it. Props to Rebel for creativity! In the clip she wore a purple, see-through mesh top over a black bra, and allowed her blonde locks to fall above her shoulders in pretty curls. It comes one day after the Cats actor posted a series of snaps showing off her slimmed-down figure in a light blue tracksuit. “I call this series: At Home with Rebel,” she captioned the carousel post, in which she wore pants and an unzipped hoodie, exposing her black bra.
In the first snap, she totally looked like a model as she posed on top of her chic white sofa, and smized like a pro! In the second pic, the Pitch Perfect actress stood in front of her camera with her leg popped out to the size and her blonde tresses styled into pretty curls, falling below her shoulders. Finally, she channeled her now-iconic role in Cats for the third pic as she crawled towards the camera. Rebel’s personal trainer Jono Castano Acero applauded her self-timer shoot and commented “yes” along with several fire emojis.
The Aussie star recently got in an intense outside workout, going toe-to-toe with Jono at a park in Sydney. After exercising with some workout bands, Rebel strapped on her boxing gloves for a sparring session. After losing so much weight before COVID-19, it appears Rebel wasn’t going to let a pandemic ruin her workout routine. Rebel revealed her dramatic 40-pound weight loss at the 2019 premiere of Muriel’s Wedding: The Musical in Melbourne, Australia. Ever since then, she has basked in the glory of her hard work with every public appearance.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">K-Pop idol Lisa’s legs is the latest quarantine meme to hit the internet.
The BlackPink member accidentally started a whole new internet ‘Did it Work?’ meme, crediting her thigh-high leather boots featured in a sultry dance cover of 6lack and Quin’s 2019 single ‘Mushroom Chocolate’ released on her personal YouTube channel.
Users soon jumped on the hilarious meme bandwagon by screenshotting her dance performance and cropping themselves, or other public figures, side-by-side to the K-Pop artist’s pair of thigh-high boots.
High-profile celebrities like Dolly Parton, Luke Evans, Stephen Colbert, Lil Nas X, and James Corden have also similarly taken part of the current meme craze and captioned “Did it Work?” in their posts.
In just a week, her video performance choreographed by Cheshir Ha and filmed by Anthony King has already amassed 17 million views.
Known for her dancing skills, YG Entertainment’s first non-Korean artist has been regularly posting dance covers on her YouTube account.
The Thailand-born rapper and dancer was a trainee under YG Entertainment before making her debut as a BlackPink member in August 2016. She is reportedly the most-followed K-Pop star on Instagram, amassing a whopping 32.4 million followers.
Aside from her group activities, Lisa is currently a mentor on Chinese talent show, ‘Youth With You’, alongside Cai Xukun, Jony J, and Ella Chen.
While Blinks are looking forward to solo music from Lisa, they are anticipating BlackPink’s collaboration with Lady Gaga.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby's raunchiest Celebrity Juice moments as she quits show</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has officially left Celebrity Juice after 12 whole years of being a team leader on the show.
She made the announcement on Instagram after rumours of her departure had started to circulate on social media.
Sharing a string of pictures covering her time on the show, the 39-year-old confirmed the news to her 6.6million Instagram followers.
The star wrote: ‘Thank you Celebrity Juice for 12 years of fantastic chaos… I can’t quite believe what we’ve done and how quick that time has gone.
‘Thank you to you all for watching… We’ve always had the loudest and best audiences.’
Since then, Metro.co.uk has decided to look back at some of her best bits and has compiled a list of her raunchiest (and funniest) moments.
One of the most repulsing challenges of the show, Holly and her fellow team leader at the time, Fearne Cotton, were tasked with guessing what kind of smoothie they were drinking.
This time around it was a blend of fish, chips and mushy peas – which are a great combo on their own, but probably not the best when pureed.
Slurping up the substance through a straw, Holly was finding it difficult to get any of the concoction to her lips.
And that made her quip: ‘It’s so thick I can’t get it up.’
Well, the innuendo was just too much for host Keith Lemon, who was bent over in stitches at her response.
Holly and Fearne are not afraid of getting down and dirty, and this is exactly what they did during House of Tongues.
While Keith watched from afar, the duo had to use their tongue (and tongue only) to carry a tiny raisin covered in chocolate from the floor over to a table.
Licking the mat that it was placed on, Holly managed to get one side of the treat while Fearne licked up the other, seeing the girls struggle to make it off the ground.
After a couple of attempt though, they smashed the technique and completed th challenge.
Through no fault of her own, this probably turned out to be one of Holly’s raunchiest moments on the show – and it’s all down to the minds of the viewers are home.
Because what’s so wrong about carrying a banana around an assault course in your mouth?
Jumping through hoops and crouching underneath hurdles, Holly and Fearne managed to complete the challenge with the whole banana in tact.
What champs!
Ant McPartlin had to take a year off presenting I’m A Celebrity: Get Me Out Of Here! following his car crash in 2018.
However, this meant Holly stepped in, and joined Declan Donnally as his new co-host.
But before sending her all the way to Australia, Keith Lemon made sure she was well equipped when it came to Bushtucker Trials.
Forcing her to get used to her new normal, Celeb Juice made their own version of the show, seeing Holly lick chocolate mousse out of a pot while blindfolded.
Keith Lemon told viewers Lick My Baubles was a Christmas present to all those ’16-year-old boys watching’ as he made Holly crouch down and taste the festive decorations.
The aim of the game was for the team leaders (and Michelle Keegan) to guess what festive sauce he’d dipped the baubles in before the show.
While Michelle got a mouthful of cranberries, Fearne was treated to mushed up sprouts.
However, when Holly licked the decs, there was absolutely nothing on them!
‘You’ve got nothing on your baubles, you’re just doing this for s**ts and giggles,’ she told the host – oh Holly, we’re going to miss you!
While it’s not confirmed who is going to replace Holly on the ITV2 show, Michelle Keegan, Emma Bunton and even Eamonn Holmes are key favourites.
Her departure comes after Fearne Cotton also decided to call it quits on the show, seeing Paddy McGuinness take her place as a team leader.
Celebrity Juice continues Thursdays, on ITV2, at 10pm.

Someone said: ‘Shamea is smart. No matter how crazy her bestie, Porsha, acted towards Kandi, Shamea stayed close to Kandi and Todd. She knows they are the plug. Looking forward to the show.’
Another happy follower posted this message: ‘Awesome. Y’all some hustlers! Love it! Make that coin! Don’t check for me unless you got a check for me!’
One other commenter said: ‘This is a great idea because celebrities love to say they don’t read the comments this is bold. I love it.’

In other news, Kandi recently shared a photo on her social media account in which she’s together with Todd Tucker and their kids, Ace Wells Tucker, and baby Blaze Tucker. Their fans cannot get enough of this happy family.
People were impressed by how much Blaze is twining with Kandi.
Kandi has been spending her time at home these days, and she’s been urging her fans to do the very same thing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joe Wicks reunites with family after hospital hospital stay with hand fracture</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Joe Wicks is back home with family after a hospital stay to have hand surgery.
The fitness coach was admitted to Kingston hospital in London after falling off his bike.
He has now been sent home to recuperate, and shared the moment he was reunited with his children on social media.
The 33-year-old was met at the front door by Indie, who then took a selfie of her dad.
In a sweet Instagram video, Joe walked into his kitchen where his one-year-old daughter Indie and baby son Marley, born in December, were sitting on the kitchen table.
As he watched them playing, he told them how much he had missed them while he was in hospital.
After cooking up a wholesome frittata for his family, he then settled down for a nap with baby Marley, calling it ‘heaven’.
After having surgery on his hand, the father-of-two said he was feeling ‘fantastic’.
In an update from his hospital bed, Joe said: ‘The antibiotics have well and truly kicked in. The inflammation and the swelling has gone right down.’
He shared that he will be resuming his popular P.E. lessons for the nation on Monday morning.
Joe’s wife Rosie will be helping him out in the upcoming session as he might not be able to demonstrate certain excercises due to his injury, but he ‘doesn’t want to let anyone down’.
‘It’s well out of her comfort zone but she’s my best friend and she knows how much this means to me,’ he went on.
‘I don’t want to let anyone down but I don’t think I’m going to be able to demo many exercises so I’ll be having Rosie on camera with me.
‘I’ll still lead the session and coach you through it. I’ll just have Rosie demonstrating the moves.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Joe Wicks is all smiles as he returns home from hand surgery and plays in the garden with his kids</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JOE Wicks has returned home to his family following his recent hand surgery.
The Body Coach - who underwent surgery for a persistent injury on his hand - was all smiles as he played with his young children at his home in Richmond today.
Taking to Instagram, Joe, 33, revealed he had returned home from the hospital to be greeted by one-year-old daughter India.
Alongside a snap of the adorable tot and son Marley in the kitchen, he wrote: "So happy to be home with my family."
Joe and little India were later spotted playing on a climbing frame in the garden.
The fitness guru - famous for giving the nation daily PE lessons on YouTube - underwent surgery this week.
Sharing a snap from his hospital bed, he explained: "They aren't able to do the operation today, they have other patients in the queue.
"They are a bit slower with certain things so I'm staying tonight.
"They're going to give me some nice morphine, and some antibiotics on the drip-a-roo. In the morning, hopefully first thing, I'll be having the wires taken out."
He added later: "I tell you what, this infection is no joke. I've had codeine up to my eyeballs. They gave me liquid morphine, but it ain't taking the edge off it. It's throbbing."
He added: "I've got a drip of liquid paracetamol. That is absolutely fantastic. Paracetamol IV saves the day for now, almost instant effect and on the pain.
"So glad I'm staying here tonight. I woke up all night last night as it was throbbing and pulsating like liquid hot magma.
"Thanks for all your well wishes. Gonna get a good night's sleep I think."
Following the procedure, the fitness star shared a short video on Instagram from his hospital bed and said it looked like they'd "left a golf ball" under his bandage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">John Fashanu wants to stage a Gladiators revival with co-host Ulrika Jonsson</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">John Fashanu has said that he wants to revive Gladiators with Ulrika Jonsson.
The former footballer fronted the popular reality show during its 90s peak – and he think the show deserves a comeback.
Originally, Gladiators ran from 1992-2000, with a massive 14 million tuning in each week in its heyday. The show was rebooted in 2008, but lasted just two years on the air.
Now, speaking to The Sun, the former footballer is ready to get back on that inflatable stage.
‘The health and well-being market is played out all over Instagram, with fit men and women pushing us to believe in ourselves and be kind to our minds and bodies.
‘So there is the next generation of Gladiators right there ready to inspire us — and a new audience ready to absorb it.
Fash continued: ‘I think it would be a hit — TV bosses are missing a trick.’
Well, we say – why not?!
Although personally we won’t be applying for this revival – we’ve already put on far too much quarantine weight.
After her stint on Gladiators, Ulrika went on to star in numerous reality TV productions as a contestant; from Dancing On Ice, Celebrity Big Brother and Celebrity Masterchef.
She was last seen on-screens in First Dates Hotel, where she opened up about how ‘lonely’ she had felt in her last marriage.

    <h5 class="mb-1">John Fashanu launches bid to bring back Gladiators with Ulrika Jonsson as co-host</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JOHN Fashanu has launched a bid to bring back Gladiators — and wants to return with co-host Ulrika Jonsson.
The series was massive in the Nineties, attracting audiences of up to 14million at its peak.
And the former Wimbledon footballer believes a new generation of fitness-obsessed youngsters would lap up a modern day version of the sports-based game show with a whole new set of Gladiators.
In an exclusive chat, he said: “The health and well-being market is played out all over Instagram, with fit men and women pushing us to believe in ourselves and be kind to our minds and bodies.
“So there is the next generation of Gladiators right there ready to inspire us — and a new audience ready to absorb it.
“I think it would be a hit — TV bosses are missing a trick.”
The series ran from 1992 to 2000 on ITV before briefly returning on Sky One in 2008 for two years.
Fash had two spells hosting the series with Ulrika, with England rugby star Jeremy Guscott replacing him briefly for two series in 1997.
The combat show created household names of that era including Diane Youdale as Jet, James Crossley as Hunter — who briefly dated Ulrika — and the legendary Wolf, aka Michael Van Wijk.
Mark Smith, known to millions as Rhino, has backed Fash’s campaign.
And the former bodybuilder, who is starring in forthcoming Netflix movie thriller The Harder They Fall alongside Idris Elba, remains in such great shape he could still compete himself.
He said: “Gladiators appeals to all ages and is the ultimate combat show.
“Nothing on TV has come close to replacing it.
“The show should definitely come back. I’d love to return too.”
I’m sold.
ROMESH Ranganathan is easy to pick out in this unlikely stage line-up – but the chances are you won’t recognise his fellow comic Rob Beckett standing on the far left.
Unlike his bearded co-star, the fresh-faced funnyman had to wear stick-on face fuzz as the pair joined the cast of Swan Lake.
The results can be seen tomorrow on Sky One’s Rob And Romesh Vs, a comedy documentary show that is returning for a second run.
In the first episode, the lads are on a mission to explore ballet.
So the duo were given behind-the-scenes access at the Birmingham Royal Ballet Company.
They even met the company’s creative director Carlos Acosta, who is one of the greatest dancers of his generation.
But I’m not sure his casting skills would be up to much if he hired these two.
SCARLETT Moffatt is releasing a new Radio 1 podcast in which she explores one of her favourite topics – conspiracy theories.
She will be pondering everything from alien autopsies to lizard overlords alongside her boyfriend Scott Dobinson, who is a confirmed cynic.
It is called Scarlett Moffatt Wants To Believe.
A different theory will be probed every Monday from May 11 on BBC Sounds, but there is also a little teaser available today.
Scarlett said: “I’m obsessed with conspiracies.
“I’m in my element on this podcast as we cover everything from aliens to the Illuminati to mermaids.
“My boyfriend Scott is a non-believer so there’s some fun arguments – sorry, debates.”
The couple have been dating since the start of 2019 and now live together.
Scarlett is the latest in a line of stars who have enlisted partners and family to help them produce shows in lockdown.
WATFORD footballer Troy Deeney will this week join Stephen Fry for the Celebrity Book Club on BBC Bitesize Daily.
It is available through BBC iPlayer and has invited famous faces to read for youngsters during lockdown.
COLONEL Tom Moore has yet another thing to celebrate following a grateful nation’s congratulations on his 100th birthday last week.
The World War Two veteran and super-fundraiser is to be honoured with his own documentary, as part of BBC1’s coverage during commemorations of the 75th anniversary of VE Day.
The story of Colonel Moore’s life will cover his childhood, through his years in the Armed Forces and right up to today, when he helped rake in a staggering £32million for the NHS by walking laps of his garden.
It will form part of the coverage, called VE Day 75: The Announcement Of Victory, which is being screened on Friday from 2.45pm.
The day looks back at the end of fighting in Europe in 1945.
And in another move illustrating how special the man is, the Beeb has enlisted movie star Tom Hardy to provide the voiceover for the documentary.
It will be a fitting tribute and richly deserved.
FROM loo roll challenges to turning ironing boards into DJ decks, there has been some crazy footage popping up online lately.
Now Charlotte Crosby is bringing it together in one MTV show called Lockdown Laughs, which starts next Monday on MTV.
The former Geordie Shore star and Celebrity Big Brother winner will front six episodes from where she is self-isolating.
Charlotte will also be roping in some celebrity pals to carry out their own challenges via video link.
WHAT? Isolation Stories, ITV, 9pm.
WHY? Sheridan Smith stars in the first of four short dramas curated by Jeff Pope. Each features a different actor filming from their homes during the lockdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michael Jackson abuse accusers to try and sue firms linked to the late star</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two men who accused Michael Jackson of sex abuse are expected to return to court next month to take action against firms linked to the late star.
Wade Robson, 37 and James Safechuck, 42 - who appeared in the documentary Leaving Neverland last year - are reportedly going to sue MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures.
Both Wade and James claim they were molested as children by the late popstar.
According to The Sun, the men want to prove the allegations were true and reveal that firm bosses were aware, or should have been.
Michael Jackson's estate is still exempt from facing legal proceedings.
“We’re finally back in the courtroom," their attorney Vince Finaldi is reported by the publication to have said.
“We were supposed to have a hearing a couple of weeks ago, but it has been delayed due to the coronavirus – so we have another date set for June.
“It will be the first hearing in the case. It’s a new judge and it will be resolved one way or another. We are preparing for a trial later in the year.”
Both Wade and James previously attempted to sue the companies in 2013 and 2014.
However, their case was thrown out in 2017 after a trial judge said they had waited too long to file the allegations.
At the time Californian law required claimants to file before they turned 26 - but Wade and James were both in their thirties.
This changed at the beginning of 2020, when a new law came into effect that allowed victims of sexual abuse to sue until they are 40 years old.
Both Safechuck and Robson detailed a string of abuse claims in the 2019 documentary Leaving Neverland.
Michael Jackson's estate and his family have continued to deny the sex abuse claims.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'American Idol': Top 11 Revealed</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Following last week’s top 20 performances filmed in the contestants’ homes, the pool was chopped in half on Sunday night. The top 10 voted through by viewers had to sing virtual, at-home performances again, and judges Katy Perry, Luke Bryan and Lionel Richie provided remote feedback. The judges also opted to use their one save of the season to form a top 11.
Former Idol Phillip Phillips opened the show with his very fitting song “Home,” and then the first results were announced. Louis Knight was voted through, and for his next at-home performance, he sang “In My Place” by Coldplay, accompanying himself on the keyboard while his family watched. He brought the emotion, but it wasn’t the most vocally impressive. “It pulled at my heartstrings,” Perry said. Bryan said he wasn’t completely blown away.
Also voted through was Julia Gargano, who gave a gritty performance of “In Her New York State Of Mind” by Billy Joel, showing off her tone and ad libs. It was a good song choice, and Bryan went so far as to call it his favorite performance of the year so far, giving it a 12 out of 10. Richie said she made it her song.
Jovin Webb delivered another smooth and captivating performance, singing “Voodoo” with an impressive delivery. “It’s magic,” Richie said. Perry said she felt transported by the performance. “You did not hit one bad note,” Bryan added.
Grace Leer also advanced, singing “Over the Rainbow” in an understated and technically impressive performance. She put some of her country twang into it, and Perry said she had never heard her voice like that before. “It was like you were singing to thousands.”
Jonny West sang “Faithfully” by Journey while playing the keyboard for his performance, and he put a lot of soul into it. Bryan praised his ability to make it seem effortless and commended his “well placed falsetto moments.”
Also voted through, Sophia James sang an understated and intimate arrangement of “In My Room” by the Beach Boys. She also played the keyboard. “You’ve done the work in terms of sussing out where your delivery sweet spot is,” Richie said. “It was so upper-echelon,” Perry added.
Arthur Gunn joined the advancing artists, giving a performance of “Country Road” by John Denver while playing the guitar. He made it his own with his signature tone and sound. “I felt so much more connected to that performance,” Perry said. “That was amazing.” He definitely put his own spin on the popular country hit.
Singing “Grandma’s Hands” by Bill Withers and dedicating it to her own grandmother, Just Sam made it through. It was another really strong song choice, and Just Sam has completely come into her own. Perry again felt transported, and Bryan praised her range.
Also voted through was Dillon James, who sang an up-tempo arrangement of “Yesterday” by The Beatles and played the guitar. He had a lot of runs and ad libs. “You have an absolute sound to your voice,” Richie said. Perry wanted more breath to it, and Bryan agreed.
The last artist to get voted through was Francisco Martin, who sang “Falling Like The Stars” by James Arthur and played the guitar. It was an emotional and tight performance. “You really know how to get a lot of emotion out of the song,” Bryan said. Richie gave a shout out to Martin’s song, who is a first responder.
The judges then opted to use their one save of the season on Makayla Phillips, who sang “The House That Built Me” by Miranda Lambert after securing her spot in the top 11. She got emotional about being able to advance. “I’m so glad you came back to allow America hear how great of a singer you are,” Bryan said of the 17-year-old singer.
Lauren Spencer-Smith, Franklin Boone, DeWayne Crocker, Cyniah Elise, Kimmy Gabriela, Aliana Jester, Faith Becnel, Nick Merico and Olivia Ximines were eliminated from the competition. The top 7 will be revealed and sing against next week.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">From his front porch, Louis Knight competed on another at-home “American Idol”.
Due to COVID-19, the contestants have had to perform their weekly songs from their living rooms, kitchens and backyards.
This week, Knight wowed as he played the piano and sang Coldplay’s “In My Place” while his family looked on.
“I think it was very commendable of you to lean into your roots,” judge Katy Perry said. “I thought it was a good song choice, it pulled at my heart strings.”
Meanwhile, Luke Bryan wasn’t “blown away” but did praise Knight for his “star quality.”
“You did a great job my friend,” Lionel Richie added. “Keep playing that camera, that is going to be the ticket that gets you over the top.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Patty Jenkins explains why 'Wonder Woman 1984' has two villains</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES: Filmmaker Patty Jenkins has made it clear that it wasn't her idea to have two villains in her upcoming movie "Wonder Woman 1984" and says it happened organically.
The much-awaited film is a sequel to Jenkins' 2017 blockbuster "Wonder Woman", starring Gal Gadot as the titular DC superhero.
In the sequel, which will come out in August, Gadot's Wonder Woman will face-off against Barbara Ann Minerva aka Cheetah (Kristen Wiig) as well as businessman Maxwell Lord (Pedro Pascal).
"It turned out that the story was the thing that gave birth to the need for both (villains)," Jenkins told Total Film in an interview.
"It wasn't that I thought I needed both. Cheetah was the villain that we were focused on having in this movie, but then Max Lord, throughout the history of Wonder Woman comics - he serves a very mechanical purpose, often," she added.
The filmmaker also explained her decision to cast Wiig opposite Gadot in the sequel.
"It doesn't have to be against expectations, I think it has to be fresh, you know? If it was just a vixen...like, Gal's a model, a full-blown model.
If we cast another full-blown model and it's a cat fight? "That felt a little dull, versus a beautiful woman who's totally different - Kristen - who's really funny but a total juxtaposition to Gal.
So they have such a different space. I thought that was an interesting way to tell the story," Jenkins said.
As for Pascal, the director said the "Narcos" star has done a "fantastic" job with his character.
"Max Lord is a great 'Wonder Woman' character. I love him serving the role he is right now. Pedro Pascal is fantastic at this role.
It's like you've never seen him before too," Jenkins added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Here Are the Best Twitter Reactions to Netflix's Extraction</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Extraction, which premiered on Netflix on April 24, is on its way to becoming the most-watched feature film on the streaming service. On Saturday, Hemsworth released a video statement on his Instagram account, with the following message:
"Hey what’s up guys?," he starts."Hope you're doing well. I just want to say a massive thank you to everyone that checked out Extraction. You've made it the #1 film on the planet right now."
Netflix also issued a statement expressing their gratitude to fans: "Extraction is well on its way to becoming the biggest-ever film premiere on Netflix—with a projected 90 million households getting in on the action in the first 4 weeks," the company wrote. "Thanks to everyone who watched so far!"
So now that we know everyone is freaking out about this film enough to make it the No. 1 movie people are watching, it's time to look into all the hype on Twitter. First, it's important to know that this film is about a black-market mercenary named Tyler Rake who is hired to rescue the kidnapped son of an international crime lord. Obviously, this is a pretty risky, deadly mission, but action movies about deadly missions seem right up Chris Hemsworth's alley.
Hemsworth is obviously feeling the love that people have for his latest big hit. He tweeted that he woke up to find that his Instagram account was absolutely blowing up with likes. "Woke up to a notification saying my new IG acct got put on hold due to unusual activity. Do I already regret this???," he wrote.
Let's take a look at all of this Extraction social media action; maybe this round-up will help the movie's star keep track of all the love he's getting.
According to Hemsworth's Instagram story, this is how we should all wish Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson a happy birthday today:
Genius.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A small prayer meet was held today at the Bandra residence of actor Rishi Kapoor, who passed away on April 30 after two years of battling Leukaemia. Given the lockdown and corona situation, the family ensured that only a few close family members attended the prayer meet.
Randhir Kapoor said, “Rasam pagri puja was held yesterday. His ashes were immersed today in Banganga, Mumbai, followed by a quiet prayer service with family at his home because of the virus.”
Along with wife Neetu and son Ranbir, the late actor’s daughter, Riddhima,was also present for the prayer meet. Riddhima, who couldn’t attend her father’s final rites owing to travel restrictions, reached Mumbai on Saturday evening after taking special permission to travel from Delhi by road.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paradise City trailer sees Cameron Boyce in final role before death</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The trailer for Paradise City has dropped and features the late Cameron Boyce in his final role before his sudden death last year.
The upcoming new show, which is set to debut later this year, follows aspiring musician Simon (played by Boyce) and a rock star he worships as their worlds become intertwined.
‘Do you think that devil worship is real in Hollywood, like the whole black magic and all that stuff,’ the star’s character asks in the gripping teaser.
‘Oh, I definitely think there’s good and evil spirits, and black magic is real,’ Perrey Reeves’ character responds.
Entourage’s Rhys Coiro and Bella Thorne also feature in the new eight-part series, created by Ash Avildsen.
Boyce passed away aged 20 on 6 July 2019 after suffering a seizure in his sleep due to epilepsy.
Last month, the cast of Jessie gathered virtually to pay tribute to their co-star Cameron, nearly a year after the young actor’s sudden death.
Peyton List thanked the late actor for teaching her ‘so much’ and making her ‘such a better person’, while Skai Jackson admitted she had been ‘so excited’ to meet the star before auditioning for the Disney Channel show.
Cameron portrayed Luke Ross on the programme, and Peyton and Skai played his sisters Emma and Zuri Ross.
According to the Los Angeles Country Medical Examiner-Corone, Boyce had a ‘sudden unexpected death in epilepsy.
The Descendants’ actor’s family further confirmed after the report was revealed: ‘Cameron’s tragic passing was due to a seizure as a result of an ongoing medical condition, and that condition was epilepsy.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paradise City trailer: Musical drama series features Cameron Boyce’s final appearance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A trailer for upcoming musical drama series Paradise City’s season 1 is out. The series marks the final appearance of late American actor Cameron Boyce, known for Disney Channel series The Descendants. The actor passed away in July last year at the age of 20.
Ash Avildsen has created, written and directed the series. Paradise City is about the rock scene and is clearly geared towards teenagers and young adults and promises a psychedelic musical drama experience. Specifically, it explores a rock star and his connection to devil worship and other occult stuff.
Andy Black, Bella Thorne, Drea De Matteo, and Hopsin also star.
The logline of the series reads, “The lives of a rock star with ties to the occult and a young rookie kid who idolizes him collide through their broken homes built by the music business.”
The official Instagram handle of the series shared an emotional message for Boyce along with one of his photos from the series. The tribute read, “Cameron Boyce stars as a leading character “Simon” in all eight episodes of the first season of Paradise City. The series was filmed just months before his tragic passing. He gave us an incredible performance as a young musician, band leader and aspiring DIY executive in the music business. Cameron was a truly one of a kind spectacular talent. ❤️💙💜 Every scene he was written in was shot and completed in the first season. We will be donating a portion of the tv show’s profits to @thecameronboycefoundation #cameronboyce #paradisecityshow.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Meghan Markle and Prince Harry eye up £10million LA mansion with ‘granny annexe’ flat for mum Doria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry are eyeing a sprawling £10million mansion — and planning to move her mum Doria in with them.
Potential buyers can get a ­virtual 360-degree tour of the six-bedroom property close to LA’s affluent Pacific Palisades.
It is being sold by Fast and Furious film producer Steve Chasman, and celebrity neighbours include Tom Hanks and Ben Affleck.
Sources say Meg, 38, and Harry, 35, want to find a property with large grounds for them and Archie — plus a “granny annexe” flat for 63-year-old social worker Doria.
Tonight one said: “Once quarantine and lockdown are over, Harry and Meghan will be moving into their new pad — and they want Doria to be included in these plans.
“She is hugely independent though, and doesn’t want to be in their space.
“She will have her own granny annexe.
"The family have been joking that Meghan and Harry will now have a babysitter on tap, but the reality is Meghan doesn’t trust many people and Doria is her rock and her biggest champion.
“Harry has also grown close to her so, believe it or not, he was receptive to the idea of living with his mother-in-law.
"Obviously, under lockdown, they won’t be moving house any time soon but they are both looking forward to laying down more permanent roots in Los Angeles, and ­making it home.”
The luxury mansion overlooks the sea and boasts a cinema, swimming pool, one-acre garden and a pergola.
It also offers a giant children’s play area — perfect for Archie, who turns one this week.
According to the glossy prospectus, other perks include a chef’s kitchen and in-built BBQ area — ideal for foodie Meghan.
The property has been on the market since September, and its gated community is said to be one of the safest in the area.
Since moving from Canada to the US, the couple have been renting a home close to Sir Elton John.
They have been spotted walking their dog in LA while wearing protective facemasks.
Last month we told how they had also shown an interest in movie star Mel Gibson’s £12million mansion in Malibu.
One local estate agent posted online they had actually bought it but a veil of secrecy surrounded the potential purchase.
The property is understood to still be on the market.
CORONAVIRUS could slash royal income by up to £100million this year.
Rentals from the Duchy of Cornwall and Crown Estate are down and residences can’t attract visitors.
A source admitted: “Finances are in severe trouble.”
The cash woe could impact Palace repairs and 1,200 staff.
The Palace said its focus was on following guidelines in the lockdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle look to buy $13 million mansion round the corner from Tom Hanks and Ben Affleck - complete with a 'granny annex' for Doria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are looking to buy a $13 million mansion round the corner from Tom Hanks and Ben Affleck, complete with a 'granny annex' for Doria, according to sources close to the couple. 
The Sussexes are said to be eyeing up a sprawling six-bedroom home near LA's wealthy neighborhood of Pacific Palisades and are planning to have Meghan's mom Doria move in with them and baby Archie. 
'Once quarantine and lockdown are over, Harry and Meghan will be moving into their new pad - and they want Doria to be included in these plans,' a source told The Sun.
'She is hugely independent though, and doesn't want to be in their space. She will have her own granny annex.'
The source said Meghan wants to keep her mother, 63, close as she is 'her rock' and now 'doesn't trust many people' outside of an immediate circle of family and friends.
'The family have been joking that Meghan and Harry will now have a babysitter on tap, but the reality is Meghan doesn't trust many people and Doria is her rock and her biggest champion,' they said.
The source said that, while Harry has reportedly grown increasingly distant from his own family after the couple's shock exit from Royal life, he has forged a close bond with Doria and is happy to include her as the family looks to set down roots in LA. 
'Harry has also grown close to her so, believe it or not, he was receptive to the idea of living with his mother-in-law,' the source said.
Since moving from Canada to the US, the couple have been renting a home near to Elton John and David Furnish, who they are believed to have been in regular contact with.
'Obviously, under lockdown, they won't be moving house any time soon but they are both looking forward to laying down more permanent roots in Los Angeles, and making it home.' 
The luxury mansion they have their sights set on boasts a swimming pool, cinema, a pergola and a spectacular sea view.  
According to the listing, it sits in a gated community and also features a one-acre garden and a giant play area to keep Archie entertained. 
Pictures reveal potential buyers can treat themselves to a bath with a view of the ocean in one of the six bathrooms across the property. 
Then there's the chef's kitchen, an in-built BBQ area, not to mention the celebrity neighbors - with the property just a stone's throw from the homes of A-listers Tom Hanks and Ben Affleck. 
Its current owner is Fast and Furious film producer Steve Chasman, who put the property on the market back in September. 
The property comes in in the couple's hefty budget, based on reports from TMZ last month that they were looking for a home between $12 million and $18 million in the exclusive Bel-Air area.
The couple are being bankrolled by Prince Charles for the first year of their new life. 
Meghan and Harry first moved to Canada after they announced they were stepping down as senior working royals but then flew to California in March before the borders closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.  
Since then, they have kept a low profile, spotted only a few times walking their dogs and distributing meals to the needy for the Project Angel Food charity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ryan Reynolds Buys 385 Pizzas For Grad Students From His Former High School</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hollywood News
Written By Bhavya Sukheja | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 07:50 IST
Hollywood actor Ryan Reynolds recently delivered a virtual speech for the graduating class of his former school and bought pizza for ‘every grad’. The Vancouver-born actor, who attended the Kitsilano Secondary School, was the reportedly the best-known member of the class of ’94 and he uploaded the virtual commencement speech on YouTube for the class of 2020. 
While Reynolds advised students to ‘practice some form of compassion every day’, he also surprised them with free pizzas. Before the end of the five-minute-long video, “Oh, and I missed Nat’s Pizzeria. Every grad gets one large pizza on me. Good luck everybody”, flashed on the screen.

In his speech, the Hollywood actor also mentioned he didn’t have anything ‘super interesting prepared’. However, he signed off by throwing in a free pizza. According to an international media outlet, Nat Bastone is the owner of the Nat’s New York Pizzeria with his cousin Franco. While speaking to a media outlet, Nat said that Reynolds had told him about his plan a day before.

Nat reportedly said that the Hollywood star was a regular customer during high school. Nat even called Reynolds ‘a loyal customer’ and said that star decided to help him as his business has been ‘ok of late’. Nat said that Kits is not a small school, so the order by Reynolds is not a small one. The actor is buying a large pizza for almost 385 grad students and therefore, the bill will likely be somewhere around $10,000. 
Nat also informed that Reynolds came up with the ‘brilliant idea’ as he wanted to something nice because all the kids "got shut down for their grad ceremony". Nat said that the students will no doubt be touched by the generous gesture. Nat added that Reynolds also decided for his pizzeria as he also ordered when he was shooting for Deadpool.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ryan Reynolds gives every graduate from his old school a free pizza</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ryan Reynolds has once again proved why he’s the greatest person in the world, nay, the universe, by giving every graduate from his old school a free pizza.
Sorry, free LARGE pizza.
The Deadpool actor treated the Class of 2020 from Kitsilano Secondary School deep-pans from his favourite local pizzeria.
What a man.
And because he’s Ryan Reynolds, he also gave the students a speech that managed to be both incredibly poignant and smutty.
He kicked things off by announcing: ‘I’m an actor, I’m a writer, producer, who f***ing cares?’
Ry Ry then revealed he only went to their school because he was ‘kicked out’ of his previous school.
‘I only went to Kits for grade 11 and 12,’ The Proposal actor admitted.
‘At the end of grade 10 the vice principal [at his old school] sat me down and invited me to leave, which looking back, was just a very Canadian way of kicking me out.’
The father-of-two then talked about the lifelong friends he made at the school before revealing his ‘chestnut of wisdom’ to the graduates would be to practice empathy towards others.
‘Totally up to you, no pressure but one thing that’s worked for me is practicing some form of compassion every day whether it’s for yourself or someone, especially for someone else, is good,’ he said.
‘You’ve heard the expression “divide and conquer,”, you see it everywhere and dividing people is just a means to distract them, disarm them, whereby giving one an opportunity to conquer, and the world seems to subsist on this idea more and more and more. And it’s getting really f***ing boring.’
Ryan went on: ‘It’s just overdone and I think that you guys want to be stylish and ahead of the curve. And I believe that your generation will be. So maybe practice the opposite, practice empathy.
‘Some of you might consider me successful. I don’t know some of you might’ve seen Green Lantern, but I’ll tell you this: empathy has gotten me so much more, so much farther.
‘To my surprise [empathy] has made me money, friends, priceless memories. It’s allowed me to fully accept and provide love. It’s helped me recognise the mistakes I’ve made and learn from them. Above all it made me happy. It’s something I’ll probably be working on my whole life.’
Ok, we were not ready for these tears today.
Then, the legend that he is, Ryan cracked a smile and told the camera: ‘I know that as soon as you saw me, you were expecting d*** jokes.
‘I’m going to save those for your university commencement speech where you’ll need them. Not that you have to go to university. God knows I didn’t.’
The video ended with the words: ‘Oh and I miss Nat’s pizzeria. Every grad gets one large pizza on me. Good luck everybody.’
We can’t.
This almost tops the time Ryan gave an 86-year-old woman born on a leap day her first ‘legal drink’.
Or all the times he feuded with Hugh Jackman.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan's elder son Babil Khan shares some unseen vintage pictures of his father from his National School of Drama days and they are sure to make you miss Khan even more
Irrfan Khan's death came as a big blow to the entire film industry. The actor succumbed to cancer last week and passed away in Mumbai's Kokilaben Ambani Hospital. Fans and celebrities are still mourning the irreparable loss. However, Irrfan's elder son Babil is making it a point to spread positivity and happiness amid such distressing times, by sharing some of the other precious pictures and videos of the late actor. Well, his latest post is no less than a priceless treasure.
The vintage pictures see a young Irrfan Khan from his National School of Drama days when he learnt the art of acting. The first picture is a candid shot that sees the Hindi Medium actor sitting on the ground with specs on and a cigarette in his mouth. Moving onto the next picture, a handsome Irrfan was seated on the top, as he practiced with his colleagues.  The last picture had Irrfan amid his performance or another practice session. It is impressive how Irrfan's expressions even then were convincing and top-notch, hence we aren't surprised the actor wowed all of us with her spectacular performances on the big screen. We miss him so much already!
Babil's caption read, "NSD."  Fans and stars were quick to pour in their love. Prior to this, Babil had shared an endearing video of Irrfan having pani puri with the caption, "When you're on diet for so long and then the shoot ends and you can have pani puri."
Check out his posts below:
On the next day of Irrfan's demise, Babil had shared a heartwarming letter thanking everyone for their support. He had written, "I'm deeply grateful for all the condolences you beautiful friends are pouring in for me. Although, I hope you understand that right now I'm not being able to reply because my vocabulary is dizzy. I will get back to each one of you but just not right now. Thank you so much! I love you.” (ALSO READ - Irrfan Khan's Family Keeps His Twitter Account Alive, Wife Sutapa Sikdar, Sons Babil-Ayaan Khan Post Heart-Wrenching Letter)

    <h5 class="mb-1">Irrfan Khan’s UNSEEN Pictures From NSD Days Is Making Us Miss Him More Than Ever!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Irrfan Khan left a gaping hole in not just Bollywood, but in world cinema too. While fans were shattered when news broke out of the Maqbool actor passing away, it was his family who suffered the most. While the late actor’s wife Sutapa Sikder wrote an emotional letter on the actor’s demise, his son Babil too shared his heartfelt condolences.
While Babil had earlier shared a moving video that saw Irrfan Khan gorging on Pani Puri at a fancy restaurant, he has given fans yet another treat to the Maqbool actor’s NSD days.
Taking to his social media handle, Babil has shared some black and white photos from Irrfan Khan’s National School of Drama (NSD) days. Take a look at the post here:
The NSD had released an official statement on Irrfan Khan’s demise that read, “Not only the National School of Drama has lost one of its meritorious members, Irrfan’s demise is a big loss to the Indian art and cinema fraternity.”
Irrfan Khan had a long and painful battle against cancer to which he eventually succumbed on 29th April at the Kokilaben Ambani hospital, where he was admitted for a colon infection.
Babil has thanked all the fans and admirers of Irrfan Khan for the love and respect that they have showered on the deceased actor. Babil’s statement read, “I’m deeply grateful for all the condolences you beautiful friends are pouring in for me. Although I hope you understand that right now I’m not being able to reply because my vocabolary is dizzy. I will get back to each one of you but just not right now. Thank you so much. I love you.”
Our heart reaches out to Irrfan Khan’s family and may God bless them with strength and courage to deal with these difficult days.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Star Wars threat: study
The Star Wars military program had the potential to “tear the Western Alliance apart”, the Australian-born director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, Dr Robert O’Neil, said. Star Wars, officially called the Strategic Defence Initiative, had reopened the old arguments of the late '60s about the desirability of anti-ballistic missile systems. Dr O’Neil was launching the institute’s 1984-85 Strategic Survey.
No sale of the century
“A champion contestant on the television quiz show Sale of the Century has been forced to return all her prizes after the producers discovered she had appeared on the program before,” wrote entertainment reporter Richard Glover. “She did well during her first appearances on the show 2½ years ago. During her second try, recorded over the past few weeks, the woman did even better, winning eight episodes.”
Rector quits over wine
“An Anglican rector is to quit his parish in a dispute concerning the use of non-alcoholic grape juice in Holy Communion. The Rev Lance Keogh, rector of St Barnabas’s, Oberon, is at loggerheads with the Bishop of Bathurst, the Rt Rev Howell Witt, who adopts the traditional line that fermented or alcoholic wine should be used. It was hinted that the rector was concerned with the situation of recovered alcoholics.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘BIP’s Ashley & Jared Say Clare Crawley Will Be A Great Bachelorette: ‘She Knows What She Wants’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bachelor Nation fan-favorites Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon spoke to HollywoodLife exclusively, while social distancing together amid the coronavirus pandemic. The pair revealed why they believe Clare Crawley will be a great Bachelorette star. “She stands up for herself like no other. She believes that she deserves love. She is very confident in herself and I think she’s going to call out guys when they’re not treating her right,” Ashely told us. Jared then added it will make for “great” television. “She also knows what she wants and she’s going to go after what she wants,” he said.
When asked how Clare was doing, amid filming for her season of The Bachelorette being put on-hold, Ashley said she was hopeful. “She’s doing well! I didn’t talk to her specifically about the wait but I think she’s just excited and hopes that they have a lot of good quality men for her when she does get there,” she dished. It comes as Clare seemingly threw shade at Matt James, a contestant on her upcoming season of the reality show. The hunky 28-year-old is well known as former Bachie star Tyler Cameron‘s BFF and an active member of the “Quarantine Crew,” however he also runs a charity called ABC Food Tours.
While giving interviews about the organization, which takes kids from underserved elementary schools to restaurants in their local communities, Matt opened up about his thoughts on Clare — and she wasn’t happy. “If you are doing interviews and creating Cameo accounts before you are even on my season,’ she wrote. ‘You are in it for the wrong reasons… #dontwasteyourtime,” the 39-year-old tweeted on April 25. She also added, “Respect the opportunity you’ve been given. Respect the rules. Respect me.”
Matt’s fans were quick to jump to his defense, however Jared told HL he doesn’t believe Clare was criticizing Matt directly. “To be fair, I’m not sure if she was just shading Matt. From what I heard, there were a few of the guys that were going on Cameo,” he said. “Clare is old school so of course it’s going to bother her if a guy is on there doing interviews.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ashley Iaconetti And Jared Haibon Share Their Opinions On Clare Crawley Being The New Bachelorette!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">During a new interview for HollywoodLife, Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon shared their opinions on Clare Crawley becoming the newest Bachelorette and more! Here’s what they had to say!
While in quarantine together, the happy couple had a chat with the site and among other things, revealed they think Clare will make an amazing Bachelorette!
Not only that but they even went into detail explaining why they believe that is, pretty much gushing over her!
Ashley dished that ‘She stands up for herself like no other. She believes that she deserves love. She is very confident in herself and I think she’s going to call out guys when they’re not treating her right.’
Jared thought about the audience side of things as well, adding that it will make for ‘great television.’
‘She also knows what she wants and she’s going to go after what she wants,’ the man also explained about the future Bachelorette.
Of course, Clare’s season on the dating show has actually been put on hold because of the coronavirus, COVID-19 pandemic so Ashley was asked how she’s been doing amid all of it.
Ashely stressed that she is hopeful, adding that ‘She’s doing well! I didn’t talk to her specifically about the wait but I think she’s just excited and hopes that they have a lot of good quality men for her when she does get there.’
This comes after Clare seemed to slam one of the contestants competing for her heart – Matt James!
As you may know, he is Tyler Cameron‘s best friend who also runs the ABC Food Tours charity.
That being said, during an interview in which he was promoting the charity, he also opened up about Clare and what he thought about her, something she was seemingly not too happy about.
While she never mentioned his name, her tweet that followed really seemed to be a reaction to his interview.
It reads: ‘If you are doing interviews and creating Cameo accounts before you are even on my season. You are in it for the wrong reasons… #dontwasteyourtime.’

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cindy Crawford, 54, one of the original queens of wearing Daisy Dukes, showed off a look similar to the one she wore in her famous 1992 Super Bowl Pepsi ad in a new Instagram pic on May 3, and it also had her looking just like her 18-year-old daughter, Kaia. The former supermodel wore a red Chicago Bulls jersey, a pair of denim shorts aka Daisy Dukes, and blue and black sneakers in the new snapshot, which showed her leaping mid-air while attempting to get a basketball into a basketball hoop. With her long wavy brown locks tied back into a ponytail and her profile in view, Cindy looked stunningly similar to Kaia, proving her youthful features are still clear as day.
Cindy used the photo’s caption to admit her outfit in it was from the 1990s and also took a moment to give a shout-out to the new docu-series The Last Dance, which is about former Bulls player Michael Jordan. “This is what happens when you take a girl from Illinois and put her in Jordans and a jersey that @DennisRodman gave her back in the 90s,” she wrote in the caption. “Getting ready to watch #TheLastDance tonight on @espn (and @netflix outside the US). You can also check out the pre-show chat on ESPN’s Facebook Live at 530pm est! Special shout out to my action photographer @randegerber. (And, please notice my shadow… tribute to the GOAT!)”
Although Cindy didn’t specify whether or not the Daisy Dukes she’s wearing in her latest Instagram pic are the same ones from her memorable Pepsi ad, we can’t help but wonder. The brunette beauty recently spoke in a live video chat with fellow model Naomi Campbell, 49, on Naomi’s new YouTube show No Filter, on Apr. 6 and talked a little about the clothes she wore in the ad. “I still have the shorts I was wearing in the Pepsi commercial because they happened to be the jeans I was wearing that day that we just cut off because of course my own jeans fit better than anything they had,” she told Naomi in the episode. “And it was funny because I ended up doing that commercial 10 years later after I had kids and we wore the same shorts so I felt some small victory in that.”
It’s awesome to see Cindy still looking amazing after all these years! Whether she’s wearing her Daisy Dukes or some other piece of casual or elegant fashion choice, she seems to always get just the right amount of attention!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sommer Ray Stuns Instagram Followers In Cheetah Print Crop Top And Denim Shorts, Says She Wants A Hug</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Patricia Grannum
Sommer Ray likely sent more than a couple of pulses racing in the last photo series on her Instagram page.
In the shared snapshots, the popular Instagram model and social media influencer rocked a cheetah-print crop top and matching jean shorts. The sleeveless top fit snugly on Sommer’s torso and featured two thick straps that were crisscrossed near her waist and appeared to be tied behind her back. The detail helped to accentuate her taut abs. Her light-wash blue jean shorts included a distressed hem, adding a rugged vibe to the entire outfit.
In the first photo, Sommer leaned toward the camera and swept her ombre brown and blond hair over one shoulder. While sending a smoldering stare to the camera, she arched her back slightly which helped to emphasize her enviable hip-to-waist ratio.
Sommer got up close and personal with the camera in other shots as well. In one of those closeups, she was shot at a three-quarter angle. She was captured while she held one hand d near her ear which drew the viewer’s eye to the array of gold earrings she sported for the photoshoot. In another of those photos, she lay chest-down on the ground and stared off into the distance.
In a third subset of Sommer’s shared images, she raised her knee and leaned her torso backward. In one of these shots, she struck this pose while cheekily sticking her tongue out.
In the caption of the series seemed to hint that she was lonely and hungry as she stated that she needed a hug and close to 100 chicken nuggets.
The photo series amassed close to 200,000 likes in under 45 minutes and more than 1,200 Instagram users have commented on it. In those comments, fans gushed over her beauty and her outfit.
“Cheetah print was absolutely made for u omg,” one person wrote.
“Omg you’re actually so beautiful,” another added before including a yellow heart emoji to their comment.
“So so so pretty I want to look like you,” a third commenter added.
And others responded to the request in Sommer’s caption.
“I’ll give you a hug and chicken nuggets,” a fourth commenter wrote.
Sommer is no stranger to posting alluring photos online. In one of her previous photo series, she wore a lime green one-piece swimsuit with a huge cut out at the front which showed off her abs. She paired the eye-catching swimwear with a visor and in a couple of the photos, she sucked on a bottle-pop candy.
“Baby bottle pop baby,” she wrote in the caption. “Nineties candy is forever the best.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rishi Kapoor Is LEGENDARY! Witnesses 70000% In India, 6700% Global Rise In Search Post Demise</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The late Bollywood icon Rishi Kapoor created a minor record even after his demise! Online search for the actor rose by 7000 per cent in India, and 6700 per cent globally after he passed away.
On April 30, a study by SEMrush found that fans posted 6,214 tweets on hashtag rishikapoor. Other hashtags, which were used included rishi_kapoor, riprishikapoor, riprishikapoorji, and riplegend. On these hashtags, fans tweeted 1,040 times, 995 times, 564 times, and 475 times respectively. A total of 14,394 tweets were posted about Rishi Kapoor on the day of his death.
The study further shared that the most used emoji was one expressing utter shock. 2,988 people used it. The second most used emoji was a broken heart. The third most used emoji was of a crying face with massive tears falling out of each eye. This emoji was used 961 times.
The fourth most used emoji was a tearful face with a single tear falling from the left eye. It was used 630 times. The fifth and sixth most used emojis were a bouquet and a broken black heart. Each emoji was used 556 and 484 times, respectively.
Speaking about the results, Mr. Fernando Angulo, Head of Communication, SEMrush said: “The news of Rishi Kapoor’s passing away was an unbelievable loss for entire Indian film industry. He was the true boy-next-door with a killer smile and dapper attire… While Rishi Kapoor will certainly be missed, his huge body of work remains and will ensure the actor continues to entertain audiences for generations to come”.
Rishi Kapoor passed away on April 30 after a two-year battle with cancer. The 67-year-old actor breathed his last at Sir HN Reliance Foundation Hospital in Mumbai.
His death was confirmed Amitabh Bachchan, who had tweeted: “”T 3517 – He’s GONE .. ! Rishi Kapoor .. gone .. just passed away .. I am destroyed!,” Amitabh tweeted on Thursday.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chantel Jeffries Sizzles In A Jaguar-Print Bikini And Poses With Her Cat: ‘Tiger Kween’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
Chantel's large feline companion is a snow Bengal.
DJ Chantel Jeffries mentioned tigers in the caption of the Instagram upload that she shared on Saturday, but she didn’t pose with one of the big striped cats for her latest stunning photo shoot. Instead, she enlisted the help of her much smaller pet feline, Miso, while promoting a bikini with a wild cat-inspired print.
Chantel was pictured rocking an eye-catching two-piece from Monday Swimwear, the popular line of bathing suits created by Instagram models Natasha Oakley and Devin Brugman. Chantel’s bikini featured a jaguar print in shades of tan and black. The spotted pattern was photo-realistic, almost making it appear as though it was constructed out of real fur.
Chantel’s bikini top featured thin spaghetti straps, underwire, top-stitching details, and molded demi cups that put her ample assets on full display. Her matching bottoms had a high-leg cut, a mid-rise waist, and moderately-sized sides. The garment showcased Chantel’s slender hips and shapely thighs. The model was also flaunting her flat, sculpted stomach.
The musician accessorized her swimsuit with a gold treble clef pendant necklace and a delicate charm necklace.
Chantel was wearing her dark blond hair down with a natural wave. For her beauty look, she rocked an earthy pink color on her plump pout. Her shimmery eye shadow was a pale pink hue, and her eyelashes were coated with just a smidgen of dark mascara. She was also wearing peach blush on her sculpted cheeks, and she was rocking a bold dark brow. Chantel’s flawless bronze skin had an allover glow.
Chantel chose to model her wild bikini in front of a dark jungle-green wall. The spiny tips of a large agave plant’s succulent leaves were visible in the right corner of her photo. She was posing with her left leg crossed in front of her right leg. Her left arm was hanging down at her side, and she was holding her large snow Bengal, Miso, in the crook of her right arm. The feline was intently staring at something to the right of the camera. Miso’s snow-white fur with gray spots popped against the dark wall and Chantel’s tan skin.
Since it was initially posted, Chantel’s photo has received over 300,000 likes and 1,000 comments. Many of her fans referenced the hit Netflix docuseries Tiger King in their responses to the model’s picture and caption, with a few commenters jokingly referring to her as “Chantel Baskin.”
“You can lock me up and put me in prison. Call me Joe Exotic,” read one response to her post.
“Carole baskin comin for Chantel next,” another fan wrote.
The model’s photogenic feline also received a lot of love.
“Miso looks so godly in here,” one admirer remarked.
Chantel doesn’t just model bikinis. As reported by The Inquisitr, her fans also went wild over photos of the gorgeous DJ rocking lingerie from Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty lingerie line.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Penelope Disick, 7, & North West, 6, Reunite & Wear Matching Outfits — See Cute Pic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So much fun! Kourtney Kardashian, 41, posted a cute Instagram pic of her daughter Penelope Disick, 7, and niece North West, 6, reuniting for a fun day in the sun on Saturday, May 2. It looked to be a great minds think alike kind of deal, fashion wise, for the youngsters as they twinned in their adorable matching outfits! Both of the girls wore white tank tops and colorful sweatpants that were different variations of the color pink. Kim Kardashian & Kanye West‘s eldest child also sported a pink sweatshirt tied around her waist with her hair up in a bun. The girls did differ in the shoe department, however, as North opted to wear pink sandals while Penelope had on orange sneakers.
Vroom vroom! North and Penelope looked to be spending part of their day getting in some exercise as the latter was seen chilling with her bike outside. Her father Scott Disick, 35, has been enjoying a much different kind of vehicle as of late as he’s been seen on the beaches of Malibu on his motorbike with girlfriend Sofia Richie, 22. The longtime couple have been escaping quarantine over the past month with Sofia stunning in a variety of gorgeous bikinis that effortlessly highlight her amazing figure.
Penelope and North’s reunion happened just weeks after the KarJenner clan put on one epic birthday bash for Kourtney amid them being in self-isolation. They pulled off an amazing drive by where everyone from Khloe Kardashian, 35, to Kendall Jenner, 24, parked in front of her house and celebrated their beloved family member while Rihanna‘s song “Birthday Cake” played in the background.
Kourtney and her kids appear to be doing A-OK during their time in quarantine. The mother/daughter duo made hearts melt when they recreated the iconic pasta scene from the classic Disney film Lady & The Tramp in an Instagram video posted on Monday, April 20. “My lady,” the doting mother captioned the snap. Aww!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Busy Philipps Stuns In A Floral-Print Swimsuit & Reveals That She Suffered A Wardrobe Malfunction</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Treva Bowdoin
Busy's swimsuit had a plunging neckline.
Busy Philipps looked sophisticated and sexy in a stunning floral-print bathing suit, but the garment’s low neckline caused her to suffer a wardrobe malfunction shortly before she shared a photo of her stylish swimwear with her 2.1 million Instagram followers.
The 40-year-old Dawson’s Creek star uploaded the snapshot to her account on Saturday. Busy was pictured soaking up some sun and sipping on a bright red drink. She was clad in a dark blue one-piece that featured a pretty floral print. It was covered with depictions of tiny yellow flowers and green leaves.
The swimsuit had a plunging V-neck that almost reached Busy’s bellybutton. The daring neckline was wide up top, so the actress was leaving little of her perky chest to the imagination. Busy’s bathing suit was an adjustable halter design with thick ties that were secured behind her neck in a big bow. The garment also had high-cut leg openings that showed off the actress’ shapely thighs.
Busy accessorized her swimwear with three puka shell necklaces in white, purple, and turquoise. She was also wearing two long gold chains that had crystals dangling from them. Her array of stacked necklaces included a pair of triangle pendants. One of the stone triangles was pearly white, and the other was turquoise.
The actress was sporting a tiny stud earring shaped like a pink flower in her right ear, and she was rocking a gold watch on her left wrist. She was also sporting a pair of cat-eye sunglasses with metallic blue frames.
Busy was barefaced, and she had her blond hair pulled up in a high topknot. In the caption of her post, she expressed some surprise over just how blond her roots naturally are. Like many women, Busy has seemingly decided to let her roots grow out instead of trying to touch them up herself while beauty salons remain closed.
Busy also recounted how she suffered a wardrobe malfunction before she snapped her selfie. She wrote that it was “funny” that she didn’t notice that her right breast was completely exposed for a full two minutes, and she revealed that she really doesn’t care who sees her bare chest anymore.
Busy’s followers rewarded her photo, her entertaining caption, and her amazing accessory game with over 53,000 likes and hundreds of comments.
“I needed all of this. Thank u,” wrote actress Michelle Monaghan in response to her post.
“Watta godddesss,” Vanessa Hudgens gushed.
“You are so real… I love it,” wrote one of Busy’s non-famous admirers.
“Love the swimsuit! You look amazing!!!” another fan remarked.
As reported by The Inquisitr, Busy also impressed her fans with her choice of swimwear last year when she celebrated her 40th birthday in a tiny yellow bikini.

    <h5 class="mb-1">18 Hottest Photos Of KarJenners In Bikinis: Kim, Kylie & More</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The KarJenner sisters have slayed in so many sexy swimsuits over the years, and we rounded up their best of the best. The ladies are often sharing their bikini pics on Instagram, but they’ve also been caught by paparazzi while soaking up the sun on their lavish vacations over the years, as well. During a trip to Miami, Kim Kardashian rocked a number of sexy swimsuits and posed for pics by the pool of her friend’s mansion. She was photographed wearing a white swimsuit while sunbathing, and she also hit the beach in a black bathing suit.
Kendall Jenner is often taking fun vacations with her pals, and they often involve excursions on yachts — which means lots of bikini pics of the gorgeous supermodel. One time, she went jetskiing, and then showered off on the boat while wearing her one-shouldered, polka-dotted bathing suit. Another time, she laid out on a boat in Miami while wearing a skimpy orange two-piece. Pictures surfaced of Kendall with her toned figure on full display as she soaked up the sun on the front of the boat.
We’ve also seen Kourtney Kardashian strip down to her bikini quite a bit over the years. Whether it’s on a boat in Italy with her kids, or hanging out on the beach in Mexico with friends, Kourtney always looks super sexy in her swimsuits.
There are plenty of KarJenner bikini pics to look back at as we gear up for the warm weather and summertime. Click through the gallery above to check out the sisters’ best bathing suit pics over the years to check them out!

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Star Wars Day is right around the corner and Epic Games is kicking things off in Fortnite with the return of a few limited-time Star Wars costumes.
Starting May 4, a selection of Star Wars outfits and lightsabers will be available in Fortnite’s in-game shop. This will feature the return of Rey, Kylo Ren, and Sith Trooper outfits which were previously included in its store last year ahead of the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.
“Fulfill your destiny. StarWarsDay is almost here and the Rey, Kylo Ren and Sith Trooper Outfits are back in the Shop!” reads a tweet from the official Fortnite Twitter account. “Feel like a Jedi as Lightsabers have returned for a limited time! Drop in game now and show off your skills.”
Players will also have access to green, red, blue, or purple lightsabers for a limited time.
Epic has yet to announce the official date these items will disappear; however, data miner iFireMonkey has stated they will be available until May 6. Additionally, lightsaber challenges which were first introduced last year as a limited-time event appear to have now been re-enabled. We have reached out to the developer for confirmation.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">What are your plans for Star Wars day this year? If you were going to spend your time gaming, you might be interested in returning to Epic's free-to-play battle royale, Fortnite.
For a limited time, select Star Wars skins have returned to the game's shop. This includes Rey, Kylo Ren, and Sith Trooper outfits. In addition to this is the return of four different coloured lightsabers. Take a look at everything on offer below:
If Fortnite isn't the game you want to play on May 4th, there are some proper Star Wars-themed games to choose from that are now available on the Switch. Most recently Star Wars: Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy was released, and the other titles are Star Wars: Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and Star Wars Pinball.
If you were hoping to relive some podracing memories, unfortunately, that game won't be available until 12th May. Will you be revisiting Fortnite or any Star Wars games on the 4th of May? Tell us below and may the Force be with you.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One Pokemon fan has recreated the entire Sinnoh map from Pokemon Diamond & Pearl in Animal Crossing: New Horizon.
Reddit user assaultepic shared the fruits of their labor in a post over the weekend (via NintendoLife), showing Pokemon’s Sinnoh map brought to Animal Crossing.
Made using New Horizons’ unofficial island map editor Happy Island Designer, assaultepic describes how they expanded the Pokemon theme beyond the map.
“I made some custom hoodies with the starters and put them in Able Sisters so that the villagers can ‘pick their starter,'” they write. “Not seen any do so yet though.”
“I’ve also been trying to make the villagers look like gym leaders by giving them clothes. So far I’ve got Volkner Ricky and a few others.”
Animal Crossing: New Horizons has quickly become a platform for creative projects and mash-ups since its launch. Last month Reddit user Kazoo-E released their painstaking recreation of early 2000s music videos recorded in Animal Crossing, while last week YouTuber Mako Ray unveiled their own AC project: An Animal Crossing cover band.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Random: Pokémon's Entire Sinnoh Map Has Been Recreated In Animal Crossing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">We've seen recreations of EarthBound towns and entire Zelda maps in Animal Crossing: New Horizons, and now a player who goes by the name assaultepic on Reddit has shared their creation of the fourth generation Pokémon region, Sinnoh.
This particular region was first introduced in Pokémon Diamond & Pearl on the Nintendo DS in 2006.
It was apparently as simple as searching for an image of the map on Google, importing it into the Happy Island Designer web app, and then following the grid lines in-game.
The creator says the Pokémon theme has also been expanded upon:
Although the map looks good from above, admittedly it's "not at all" practical to live on:
What do you think of this recreation? How does it compare to your own island? Leave a comment down below.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Diana’s famous Travolta dress stuck in ‘isolation room’ during lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A dress famously worn by Diana, Princess of Wales, remains stuck in lockdown before it can be displayed to the public.
Diana wore the midnight-blue velvet gown by Victor Edelstein when she danced with Hollywood star John Travolta during a 1985 state banquet at the White House.
Purchased in December for £220,000 by Historic Royal Palaces, it was due to join the royal ceremonial dress collection at Hampton Court Palace.
The dress was being prepared for display when lockdown began, and remains in a workroom, described as an “isolation room”.
Newly acquired garments undergo freezing or heat treatment, to remove moths and their eggs, before joining the collection.
The collection’s curator Eleri Lynn told Hello! magazine: “The dress is basically still in isolation.
“The dress had been frozen and then we left it to thaw out for a few weeks to make sure we were not cracking any fibres or anything like that.
“We would then repack it for more permanent storage within the collection stores. But we hadn’t quite finished that process, so it’s still sitting in the isolation room.
“Without a doubt it will be on display again. It is a perfect marriage of form and function and was the perfect dress for that evening.”
Sorry, this content isn't available on your device.
Ms Lynn added: “It’s such a momentous acquisition. It’s the perfect blend of celebrity and royalty, so it’s really special that it’s now part of a designated national collection because we will preserve it for posterity.
“We exist to tell the story of our palaces and their people, and Diana is one of them. There is still such interest in Diana and the charity work that she did, so she is still hugely relevant.”

Amid the lockdown due to coronavirus outbreak, actress Emma Stone has shared a mental health advice, urging people to spend more time writing instead of fretting. Since May is mental health awareness month, Stone has shared words of support to the people struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic, reports hollywoodreporter.com.
"Many of us are dealing with isolation, anxiety and uncertainty during this COVID-19 crisis, and this includes the 17 million kids and teens in America -- that's one in five -- who have a mental health disorder," she said as she announced the Child Mind Institute's #WeThriveInside digital campaign.
"We're inviting you to be part of our team," she added.
As part of the effort, the Child Mind Institute will share self-recorded videos daily featuring notable names talking about how they stay mentally fit. Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Andrew Garfield, Octavia Spencer, Misty Copeland, Kevin Love, Jameela Jamil, Lena Dunham, Mark Ronson, Jim Gaffigan, Zoey Deutch, Keith Powers, Julia Michaels, Moby, Missy Franklin, Nicole Scherzinger, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Lindsey Stirling, Emma Chamberlain and many others have confirmed their participation. Stone, who is a board member of the Child Mind Institute, shared her story first.
"Something I really like to do when I'm struggling with anxiety is a brain dump. What I do is just write down anything that I'm worried about," she said in the clip, adding: "I just write and write and write and I don't think about it and I don't read it back. I find it's really, really helpful for me to get it all out on paper." "I hope you're staying safe, you're staying strong and healthy and I'm sending you lots of love," she continued.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a rare video appearance, actor Emma Stone is raising mental health awareness while practising social distancing during the coronaviruspandemic.
May is Mental Health Awareness Month and the Oscar winner announced the Child Mind Institute’s #WeThriveInside campaign, a digital initiative that will help those struggling right now and beyond with tele-health and online resources.
“Many of us are dealing with isolation, anxiety and uncertainty during this COVID-19 crisis, and this includes the 17 million kids and teens in America that’s one in five who have a mental health disorder. We’re inviting you to be part of our team,” she said in the clip.
According to The Hollywood Reporter, the institute will release self-recorded videos daily featuring notable names sharing stories of how they stay mentally fit while encouraging families and kids to check out its COVID 19-related resources.
Videos will be distributed across all social media platforms of Child Mind Institute.
Stone, who is a board member of the organisation, opened up what she likes to do when she is struggling with anxiety.
“What I do is just write down anything that I’m worried about. I just write and write and write and I don’t think about it and I don’t read it back. I find it’s really, really helpful for me to get it all out on paper. I hope you’re staying safe, you’re staying strong and healthy and I’m sending you lots of love,” she said.
Other Hollywood names such as Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, Andrew Garfield, Octavia Spencer, Zoey Deutch, Nicole Scherzinger, Sarah Michelle Gellar, are also part of the drive.
Donations are also being accepted, and courtesy one anonymous donor, matched up to USD 150,000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zandra Rhodes says 'shy' party pal Princess Diana couldn't hide one bad habit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Oh, I’m not enjoying myself, I really am not,’ is the opening line from Dame Zandra Rhodes, who is not having a nice time in lockdown.
‘I’ve got a lovely penthouse with a roof garden, camellias in full bloom and my lilies are coming out, but it’s like a weird, rubbish holiday. Do you know what I mean?’
Lockdown might hit harder for iconic fashion designer Zandra because The Real Marigold Hotel has just landed on our screens and she’s being reminded of her glorious trip to India.
She was lucky enough to take the journey of a lifetime along with fellow celebrities such as Bond Girl Britt Ekland, Duncan Bannatyne and Paul Chuckle.
‘It was a fabulous experience,’ she beams. ‘Britt is an old friend anyway and legendary cricket commentator Henry Blofeld is known as the man with the golden voice if you’re my age!’ she giggles.
'It was a lovely experience being plonked together with people I didn’t know that well and having an adventure. And of course I adore India, so the culture shock didn’t bother me. I’m not sure they all liked it though,’ she says, clearly remembering a few difficult moments from the trip.
Despite some guests on the show (Zandra’s tight-lipped about who) not enjoying the experience, there were a few factors that made it tricky even for seasoned travellers.
‘Blimey we had to organise a night’s sleep for ourselves when we got there!’ Zandra exclaims. ‘I’ve been lucky that every time I’ve visited before I’ve been looked after very well, but there we all were, getting our own tickets for trains and getting lost and all sorts!’ she laughs.
‘I did sneak off and have a cup of tea with the woman who had done all the beading for me for years on my dresses, so that was wonderful,’ she smiles. ‘I had to leave the show early though as my partner had fallen ill. But I still had a lovely time.’
The fashion icon sadly lost her long-term partner, Salah, in June of last year, and has moved back to her hometown of London for the time being while selling their San Diego house. It’s obvious she is feeling the loss even more in the current climate.
‘I’ve got a lot of tasks I’ve had to put on hold,’ she tells us. ‘My partner and I lived in San Diego, so when he died I packed up the home as I didn’t need a huge house, but I ended up putting a load of stuff in storage thinking I could go back to it,’ she sighs.
‘Well, funny how life turns out, eh! But I’m finding it all extra hard as I like working and being around people. I can ignore them, don’t get me wrong,’ she laughs, ‘I like just having people in my consciousness. A lot can be said for a nod or a smile,’ she says sadly.
‘My sister lives round the corner from my London flat and she rings me every morning and evening to check I’m OK,’ she tells us. ‘But the life we had together in America was quite wonderful. He worked, I worked. He was perfect for me.’
A self-proclaimed workaholic, Zandra graduated from design college in 1963 and had made a name for herself in the fashion industry by the early 70s. Despite becoming one of the UK’s most prolific fashion designers with loyal customers such as Princess Diana and rock stars and models, she’s very modest about her achievements.
‘When I started out no one would buy my designs, so I set up a shop with Sylvia Ayton (another iconic designer who turned high street shop Wallis into a hit) and it became rather trendy,’ she tells us. ‘When it closed I thought, “I ain’t giving up now!”’ she laughs.
‘I got someone to show me how to make patterns, opened a studio in Bayswater, London, and put together some dresses. Next I took them to America and was met by the editor of American Vogue who raved about them, photographed them on Natalie Wood and then I started to sell my dresses to top shops in New York. Voilà!’
The way Zandra reflects on her career in such a nonchalant way makes us think she doesn’t like to boast about her success.
In fact, when we ask her about her friendship with Princess Diana, she goes all coy.
‘She was a very shy woman,’ she says quietly. ‘I did notice she bit her nails though!’
She also downplays her pieces she created with rock legend Freddie Mercury. ‘He and Brian May came over one evening and I made him the pleated top you always saw him in,’ she smiles.
During our chat Zandra’s phone rings constantly, (‘Oh I am good at ignoring it! Don’t worry!’), and it’s clear she loves a natter, in fact she regularly reminds us we can chat about anything we like. But she has a pretty good reason as to why looking back at her career isn’t her favourite topic.
‘It makes me feel too old!’ she howls. But appearance-wise, Zandra vows to never change her style as she grows older.
‘I’ll never, ever have grey hair,’ she tells us. ‘I have my hair bleached every eight weeks and I even re-pink it myself in between so it doesn’t go too pale. I like it nice and bright!’
Her eccentric style certainly makes her stand out in a crowd and a sense of individuality is something she had from a young age.
‘My mother was encouraging of whatever I wanted to do and I think a lot can be said for that,’ she smiles. ‘But being different has always been an accident. I’m just me.
'In fact, I had a letter a while back from a lady who said, “I used to travel on the bus to school with you and I’m so sorry me and my friends laughed at you.” I replied, “That’s nice, but I never noticed anyone laughing at me,”’ she tells us honestly. ‘I’ve always had a thick skin. And that’s lucky, this industry is impossible if you don’t have it.’
Zandra regularly brings up her late partner and loves talking about him proudly. The pair met when she was 53 – she keeps his memory alive by sharing anecdotes and hanging plenty of photographs of their happiest memories.
‘Guests love the downstairs toilet for photographs!’ she exclaims. ‘My partner with Harrison Ford and various movie stars. He was always so driven, an amazing man,’ she tells us.
When the pair met at a dinner party in New York back in 1992, Zandra was impressed by how Egyptian-born Salah was a self-made man.
‘He started as an usher in a cinema in Brooklyn and became the President of Warner Brothers,’ she tells us proudly. ‘Life was glamorous of course, but we were ordinary at home. We’d have 12 people over at the weekends and I’d cook us all a three-course meal from scratch.’
Ordinarily, out of lockdown, Zandra has fashion interns who live with her to learn the tricks of the trade. It’s an opportunity for her to get in the kitchen. ‘I have a lovely room with four bunk beds and I love making lunch for everybody,’ she tells us.
‘A nice leek and potato soup we all eat round the table. Maybe some smoked salmon and salsa. A bread and butter pudding,’ she lists, drifting off into a food daydream. ‘But cooking to be sat here on my own? Forget it! I’m bored of cooking and washing up and eating leftovers… Utterly sick of it!’
Food might not be top of the agenda at the moment, but Zandra got a chance to show off her culinary skills on Celebrity MasterChef last year alongside the likes of Oti Mabuse and Joey Essex. ‘Oti thought the boys had more help than we did. And although I didn’t win, I know for sure I was a better cook than the boys. No doubt about it!’ she cackles.
She celebrated 50 years of fabulous fashion with an exhibit and book last year, is still designing and has the ball rolling to start her own charity, so Zandra has no plans to slow down.
‘I probably should slow down,’ she says coyly. ‘But I think the easiest thing for me is to keep working and drop dead in the middle of it,’ she smiles. ‘Retiring is what I’m meant to do, but will I actually do it? Probably not.’
And with that, Zandra is off to unpack boxes, hang up more photos and tend to the plants. ‘See what I mean?’ she smiles. ‘There’s always work to be done! Oh well, l’ll get there in the end, eh?’ With a work ethic like hers, we’ve no doubt about it.
Lie-in or up early?
I never, ever lie in – 8am is the latest I ever wake up.
Healthy breakfast or fry up?
I have a bowl of cereal and a coffee. I never cook breakfast just for myself.
Chores or relaxing?
Well my normal routine has all gone to smoke! Ordinarily I’d use Sunday to visit an exhibition and cook for friends. Now I do fun chores, the washing up isn’t one of them.
TV or papers?
My TV hasn’t worked for years. I’ve never seen any of the big shows, not even that dancing programme lovely Oti is on. I don’t do papers either, I just stick to Radio 4.
Go for a walk or stay inside?
I haven’t been going for my government-approved walks, I’m very naughty. I have to try and get myself in the habit of it so I keep fit and healthy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zandra Rhodes says 'shy' party pal Princess Diana couldn't hide one bad habit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Oh, I’m not enjoying myself, I really am not,’ is the opening line from Dame Zandra Rhodes, who is not having a nice time in lockdown.
‘I’ve got a lovely penthouse with a roof garden, camellias in full bloom and my lilies are coming out, but it’s like a weird, rubbish holiday. Do you know what I mean?’
Lockdown might hit harder for iconic fashion designer Zandra because The Real Marigold Hotel has just landed on our screens and she’s being reminded of her glorious trip to India.
She was lucky enough to take the journey of a lifetime along with fellow celebrities such as Bond Girl Britt Ekland, Duncan Bannatyne and Paul Chuckle.
‘It was a fabulous experience,’ she beams. ‘Britt is an old friend anyway and legendary cricket commentator Henry Blofeld is known as the man with the golden voice if you’re my age!’ she giggles.
'It was a lovely experience being plonked together with people I didn’t know that well and having an adventure. And of course I adore India, so the culture shock didn’t bother me. I’m not sure they all liked it though,’ she says, clearly remembering a few difficult moments from the trip.
Despite some guests on the show (Zandra’s tight-lipped about who) not enjoying the experience, there were a few factors that made it tricky even for seasoned travellers.
‘Blimey we had to organise a night’s sleep for ourselves when we got there!’ Zandra exclaims. ‘I’ve been lucky that every time I’ve visited before I’ve been looked after very well, but there we all were, getting our own tickets for trains and getting lost and all sorts!’ she laughs.
‘I did sneak off and have a cup of tea with the woman who had done all the beading for me for years on my dresses, so that was wonderful,’ she smiles. ‘I had to leave the show early though as my partner had fallen ill. But I still had a lovely time.’
The fashion icon sadly lost her long-term partner, Salah, in June of last year, and has moved back to her hometown of London for the time being while selling their San Diego house. It’s obvious she is feeling the loss even more in the current climate.
‘I’ve got a lot of tasks I’ve had to put on hold,’ she tells us. ‘My partner and I lived in San Diego, so when he died I packed up the home as I didn’t need a huge house, but I ended up putting a load of stuff in storage thinking I could go back to it,’ she sighs.
‘Well, funny how life turns out, eh! But I’m finding it all extra hard as I like working and being around people. I can ignore them, don’t get me wrong,’ she laughs, ‘I like just having people in my consciousness. A lot can be said for a nod or a smile,’ she says sadly.
‘My sister lives round the corner from my London flat and she rings me every morning and evening to check I’m OK,’ she tells us. ‘But the life we had together in America was quite wonderful. He worked, I worked. He was perfect for me.’
A self-proclaimed workaholic, Zandra graduated from design college in 1963 and had made a name for herself in the fashion industry by the early 70s. Despite becoming one of the UK’s most prolific fashion designers with loyal customers such as Princess Diana and rock stars and models, she’s very modest about her achievements.
‘When I started out no one would buy my designs, so I set up a shop with Sylvia Ayton (another iconic designer who turned high street shop Wallis into a hit) and it became rather trendy,’ she tells us. ‘When it closed I thought, “I ain’t giving up now!”’ she laughs.
‘I got someone to show me how to make patterns, opened a studio in Bayswater, London, and put together some dresses. Next I took them to America and was met by the editor of American Vogue who raved about them, photographed them on Natalie Wood and then I started to sell my dresses to top shops in New York. Voilà!’
The way Zandra reflects on her career in such a nonchalant way makes us think she doesn’t like to boast about her success.
In fact, when we ask her about her friendship with Princess Diana, she goes all coy.
‘She was a very shy woman,’ she says quietly. ‘I did notice she bit her nails though!’
She also downplays her pieces she created with rock legend Freddie Mercury. ‘He and Brian May came over one evening and I made him the pleated top you always saw him in,’ she smiles.
During our chat Zandra’s phone rings constantly, (‘Oh I am good at ignoring it! Don’t worry!’), and it’s clear she loves a natter, in fact she regularly reminds us we can chat about anything we like. But she has a pretty good reason as to why looking back at her career isn’t her favourite topic.
‘It makes me feel too old!’ she howls. But appearance-wise, Zandra vows to never change her style as she grows older.
‘I’ll never, ever have grey hair,’ she tells us. ‘I have my hair bleached every eight weeks and I even re-pink it myself in between so it doesn’t go too pale. I like it nice and bright!’
Her eccentric style certainly makes her stand out in a crowd and a sense of individuality is something she had from a young age.
‘My mother was encouraging of whatever I wanted to do and I think a lot can be said for that,’ she smiles. ‘But being different has always been an accident. I’m just me.
'In fact, I had a letter a while back from a lady who said, “I used to travel on the bus to school with you and I’m so sorry me and my friends laughed at you.” I replied, “That’s nice, but I never noticed anyone laughing at me,”’ she tells us honestly. ‘I’ve always had a thick skin. And that’s lucky, this industry is impossible if you don’t have it.’
Zandra regularly brings up her late partner and loves talking about him proudly. The pair met when she was 53 – she keeps his memory alive by sharing anecdotes and hanging plenty of photographs of their happiest memories.
‘Guests love the downstairs toilet for photographs!’ she exclaims. ‘My partner with Harrison Ford and various movie stars. He was always so driven, an amazing man,’ she tells us.
When the pair met at a dinner party in New York back in 1992, Zandra was impressed by how Egyptian-born Salah was a self-made man.
‘He started as an usher in a cinema in Brooklyn and became the President of Warner Brothers,’ she tells us proudly. ‘Life was glamorous of course, but we were ordinary at home. We’d have 12 people over at the weekends and I’d cook us all a three-course meal from scratch.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Julie Hesmondhalgh admits feeling intimidated on Corrie set was exciting</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As we return to the Lake District for the third series of this hit drama, two years have passed, but Alison (Morven Christie) and Paul (Lee Ingleby) are still learning how to handle their son Joe’s autism.
Meanwhile, the 10-year-old has a new reality to deal with, as the couple have divorced and Alison’s home is now in Manchester.
As their marriage fell apart, Paul was not in a good place, reckons Inspector George Gently star Lee.
‘He felt detached, lost, out of touch and a bit of a failure, actually,’ he says. ‘I think he was struggling in life.’
Lee reckons the show’s depiction of what having an autistic child can do to a relationship is one of its strengths.
‘It’s good to be open and honest, and we’re showing this has driven a wedge between Alison and Paul,’ he says.
‘They’ve got a family together and that’s going to keep them together anyway, so it’s how they manage that, heartaches and heartbreaks.’
With Joe’s Uncle Eddie single too, the only stable couple is grandad Maurice (Christopher Eccleston) and girlfriend Louise. Her son Ralph’s got some big news to share, though.
‘Maurice is happier than his children, which bemuses him,’ admits Christopher. ‘They’re in early middle age and splintering. Their lives are falling apart, or certainly changing.’
While Alison juggles a university course with work and Joe, there’s a hint of possible romance, after a tetchy first meeting with a single dad.
But how would Joe cope with more changes on the home front? Fans will be keen to find out – and the show’s biggest star, Christopher, says it has a special place in his heart.
‘I’m known for probably three other significant roles – Doctor Who, Our Friends in the North and Cracker,’ he says
 ‘And I’m a runner, so I’m often out and about and I get stopped a lot in the street.
‘I’m stopped just as much about The A Word as I am for those three, which has surprised me. It seems autism has impacted on every person you meet. I often get people crying and saying, “Thank you very much for doing it because we never see anything about autism on the television”.
'This show is as important to me as anything I’ve ever done.’
Julie Hesmondhalgh joins The A Word this series as Joe’s teacher Heather – and admits she is finding it nerve-racking.
‘I came in as a fangirl,’ she says. ‘This has happened from Corrie onwards, I always feel I should be at the gate with my autograph book and somehow I’ve got in!
‘I’ve had to really work at creating this persona that belongs in those environments, that isn’t, “That’s Morven Christie! It’s Chris Eccleston!"
'I’ve got to just be like, “Hi, here I am, an actor, like you, on our set.”‘
'I know, rationally, we’re all human beings with insecurities... but even at the end of Coronation Street after 16 years, I would sometimes be in the Rovers Return and be like, “What am I doing here? I’m in the Rovers. How did this happen?”
'So it was intimidating but exciting.’
– The A Word returns on Tuesday, May 5 at 9pm on BBC One

    <h5 class="mb-1">Classic Corrie episodes unlocked after filming halted</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The broadcaster is putting ‘vintage’ episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale on its on-demand platform.
ITV is unlocking classic episodes of its soaps after production on new instalments was halted.
“Vintage” episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale will be placed on its on-demand platform, ITV Hub.
It comes as filming of both soaps has been stopped and transmission reduced to make the episodes which have already been recorded last longer.
Emmerdale will run out of episodes at the end of May, while Coronation Street will last until after June.
The episodes, airing every weekday on ITV Hub from Monday, will give “soap fans a trip down memory lane and a chance to relive some of soapland’s most iconic characters,” ITV said.
Coronation Street episodes from 1995, featuring Weatherfield characters Bet Lynch (Julie Goodyear), Alec Gilroy (Roy Barraclough), Mavis Wilton (Thelma Barlow), Raquel Wolstenhulme (Sarah Lancashire) and Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), will go on the platform.
Emmerdale will go back to December 1995, ahead of villainous Chris Tate’s (Peter Amory) wedding, and in the midst of Kim Tate’s (Claire King) affair.
The broadcaster is already screening classic episodes on ITV3.
It comes after ITV bosses said that Coronation Street and Emmerdale could return to screens with older cast members absent and actors six feet apart.
ITV Hub will also feature previous episodes of The Real Housewives Of Cheshire and Gemma Collins’ fly on the wall show Diva Forever.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Classic Corrie episodes unlocked after filming halted</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ITV is unlocking classic episodes of its soaps after production on new instalments was halted.
“Vintage” episodes of Coronation Street and Emmerdale will be placed on its on-demand platform, ITV Hub.
It comes as filming of both soaps has been stopped and transmission reduced to make the episodes which have already been recorded last longer.
Emmerdale will run out of episodes at the end of May, while Coronation Street will last until after June.
The episodes, airing every weekday on ITV Hub from Monday, will give “soap fans a trip down memory lane and a chance to relive some of soapland’s most iconic characters,” ITV said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Yash and Radhika Pandit recently shared the first picture of their 6-month-old son with fans on social media. For the unversed, the Sandalwood star couple became proud parents to a baby boy last year in October. And now, in an interview with TOI, Yash opened up about his kids and managing the little ones amid lockdown.
Yash said, "It is a wonderful phase. Kids not only bring a lot of happiness but also a different side of me. I have been enjoying this time with them. In fact, Ayra now has a routine that she has to feed me. She has become a mother to me - daughters are like that."
He went on to add, "She keeps running all the time. It may be because of the lockdown, as we aren't going out anywhere. She is also sensing that no one is going out, so, whenever she sees an opportunity to go out or someone opens the door, she runs. She just wants to go out in the open air. She even gets her shoes ready. So, we have a new routine, where we take her out for a walk daily and make it exciting."
On being quizzed about his son, the KGF star says, "My son is very demanding. He doesn't sleep until I do. Both Radhika and I have to sleep with him. Even if it is way past his bed time, he stays awake till we join him. And then, he wakes up at night and can be very loud when he wants to be."

The latest featured 50 Cent, a.k.a. Curtis Jackson, as U.S. Vice-President Mike Pence.
“This f**king guy won’t stop, SMH,” he wrote on Instagram.
He added, “what is this guys problem with me. f**king lunatic.”
Previously, he’s complained about the artist — who goes by the name Lushsux — who’s been plastering walls with murals of 50 Cent, including this one in which he has no teeth due to “too many trips to the candy shop.”
The “Power” star was also not amused by a mural that depicted him as Taylor Swift (“Swifty Cent”), while others included Chairman Mao, Post Malone and even Donald Trump.

However, they haven’t been flattering figures, which has caused 50 Cent to re-post the murals along with his commentary. Artist Lushux previously put 50’s face on Taylor Swift and Donald Trump, and now the artist put the Queens rapper’s face on Vice President Mike Pence. In true 50 fashion, he gave his thoughts on the artist as well as Mike Pence.
On the caption of his Instagram post, 50 said: “👀This f**king guy won’t stop, SMH 🤦‍♂️I guess I’m not wearing a mask because i’m tested frequently. 😤.” 50’s comment is calling out Pence who reportedly didn’t wear a mask while visiting the Mayo Clinic, even though the clinic states that all visitors are required to wear a mask while in the building. Take a look above.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boy George says he was too “engaged chemically” to take part in Live Aid.
The Culture Club frontman did not perform at the landmark concert despite singing on Band Aid’s track Do They Know It’s Christmas.
The singer, 58, told the Grounded With Louis Theroux podcast: “I messed it up. I was otherwise engaged chemically.
“I mean, I think it was a stroke of luck that we didn’t do it because I wasn’t in a fit state to do it.”
He said: “We were originally asked but then I think everyone was just looking at the state of me and going, ‘this might be more harmful than good’. So, they basically didn’t follow up on it.”
The singer also told Theroux, 49, he thought the presenter was on drugs when he watched him on Graham Norton’s show last year.
He later deleted a tweet asking: “What’s wrong with Louis Theroux?”
The Karma Chameleon singer said: “One of the things as a recovering addict is I often watch people of TV and I go, ‘They are off their nut’. Most times I’m completely wrong.”
Grounded With Louis Theroux is available to listen to on BBC Sounds every Monday and is also broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Wednesday at 8pm.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Taylor Swift Sends Utah Nurse A Gift Package For Her Work On The Frontlines</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Taylor Swift had a sweet surprise for a Utah nurse.
Whitney Hilton, a registered nurse, shared the message and collection of Lover items she was sent on her 30th birthday after helping out at Northwell Health’s Long Island Jewish Medical Center.
“I wanted to send you some presents and to let you know I am so grateful for you,” Swift wrote. “I can’t thank you enough for risking your life to help people and for spreading the message loudly that people need to hear about taking this seriously.”
She added, “Also, I saw the photo of you from my show! Thank you for coming! I would love to give you a hug next time and thank you in person. With love and admiration, Taylor.”
Last month, Hilton wrote a blog post published by Intermountain Healthcare, where she described her journey from Utah to Long Island to help out in what she called “a modern war.”
“This is a humbling experience,” Hilton said in the post. “I have so much to say but almost too overwhelmed to say it all. New York has been hit HARD. The people need help, the nurses need help, the doctors need help, everyone needs help. This is crisis mode like I’ve never seen. This is an incredible experience, albeit the hardest thing I’ve ever done AND equally the most rewarding.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Taylor Swift gave a fan one of the best surprises ever!
The 30-year-old “The Man” singer Whitney Hilton, a registered nurse in Utah, with a handwritten note and a bundle of Lover merchandise.
Taylor‘s surprise wasn’t only in honor of Whitney‘s 30th birthday, but a homecoming gift after the nurse returned to Utah after helping out at Northwell Health’s Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New York amid the ongoing health crisis.
“I wanted to send you some presents and to let you know I am so grateful for you,” Taylor wrote. “I can’t thank you enough for risking your life to help people and for spreading the message loudly that people need to hear about taking this seriously.”
Taylor continued: “Also, I saw the photo of you from my show! Thank you for coming! I would love to give you a hug next time and thank you in person. With love and admiration, Taylor.”
Back in April, Whitney wrote a blog post published by Intermountain Healthcare, where she described her 2,200-mile journey to lend a helping hand during the pandemic, which she called “a modern war.”
“This is a humbling experience,” Whitney wrote. “I have so much to say but almost too overwhelmed to say it all. New York has been hit HARD. The people need help, the nurses need help, the doctors need help, everyone needs help. This is crisis mode like I’ve never seen. This is an incredible experience, albeit the hardest thing I’ve ever done AND equally the most rewarding.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Ava Bennet
Animal-loving actress Kaley Cuoco delighted her 6 million Instagram followers with her latest update, a sweet snap taken outside with her dog, Blueberry. Kaley didn’t include a geotag on her post to indicate exactly where the shot was taken, but she had plopped down in an expanse of lush green grass. some wire fencing was visible behind her, but all her attention was on her adorable dog, who stood in front of her.
Kaley looked casual in a pair of dark pants, knee-high black flat boots, and a blue t-shirt. She added a floppy-brimmed black hat to protect her face from the sun, and looked ready to work in her ensemble. Kaley’s legs were slightly spread as she sat in the grass, and Blueberry had walked up between them until she was close enough that Kaley could give her a smooch. She placed both hands on her dog’s face and gave her some love in the sweet photo.
Blueberry has appeared in many of Kaley’s Instagram snaps before, as have many of her other furry friends. From horses to dogs to rabbits, Kaley is a true animal lover and always seems to make room for any creatures in need on her and husband Karl Cook’s property.
Kaley’s followers absolutely loved the sweet snap, and the post racked up over 18,000 likes within just 30 minutes. It even received a like from fellow animal-loving actress Beth Behrs, who many fans will know from her role on 2 Broke Girls.
The post also received 124 comments from Kaley’s eager fans, who took to the comments section to show a little love for Blueberry as well. The sweet dog with the gray coat looked relaxed as she enjoyed a moment with her owner, allowing Kaley to get close to her face with no concern in the world.
“Well that’s the first time that I ever wished I was a dog! Jealous,” one follower commented, envious of Blueberry’s smooch.
“Aww that’s a cute picture,” another follower said.
“She has grown up so nicely from a Puppy! Beautiful doggie!!” one fan said, followed by a heart emoji, commenting on how Blueberry has evolved during her time with Kaley.
“Oh love him. Just love how much you are into your fur babies, a girl after my own heart for sure,” another added.
Kaley’s four-legged friends appear in many of her Instagram updates, even when she’s lounging by the pool. Just a few days ago, as The Inquisitr reported, Kaley shared a clip in her Instagram stories in which she was relaxing on an inflatable raft with her foster dog, a tiny Chihuahua named Dumps, by her side.

    <h5 class="mb-1">EXCLUSIVE! Dipika Chikhlia On Ramayan Breaking Record Of Game On Thrones: “I Wish I Could Be A Part GoT”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ever since Ramanand Sagar’s Ramayan returned on television, people have been going crazy after the show and the actors. Netizens have been trending the show on Twitter and several memes have been doing the rounds around the show. Ramayan featuring Arun Govil, Dipika Chikhlia and Sunil Lahri in lead roles has become one of the most loved shows across the world and stands in the league of TV shows like Game Of Thrones and Big Bang Theory.
Recently, the news of Ramayan breaking the world record of viewership literally broke the internet. Apparently, the show recorded a viewership of 77 million on April 16, 2020, which is higher than the finale episodes of both Game Of Thrones and Big Bang Theory. The back-to-back, two-episode finale of the nerdy sitcom’s 12-season run drew 18.5 mn live viewers on May 16, 2019. Game of Thrones had around 17.4 mn live views in its finale episode, which has a huge difference from Ramayan’s viewership.
We got in touch with Ramayan’s Sita aka Dipika Chikhlia regarding the milestone that the show has achieved, and the actress said, “I mean frankly it’s quite unbelievable because it’s a world record. The show and of course us actors have gotten this kind of huge reaction after 33 years of the show’ original telecast and it’s amazing. Even at that time, the show was big, but to get so much respect and love now from the millennials and the young generation is amazing. It shows that Ramayan is still relevant in today’s time.”
Dipika further added, “I think now I feel that I have proved myself as an actor. Until now we, the cast of Ramayan, had been treated as gods. But the millennials have put it out there, that we are not gods, but really good actors who have done their jobs wonderfully. As an actor, I think I got my due credit.”
A few days ago, veteran actor Arun Govil, who portrayed the character of Ram in the show, tweeted about how he received no awards or special honour for Ramayan despite the show being a cult and superhit. Speaking about the same, Dipika Chiklia said, “I think it’s very important that you’re loved by the people. The respect that we have got by crossing 77 million in the re-run is unmatched. Of course, it’s a bonus getting awards and being appreciated for your hard work, but an actor’s main aim should always be to please the audience.”
When asked how her family reacted to all of it, the actress quipped, “Frankly there is no reaction from my family, they feel it is normal. I was excited about it because there was a post about it which compared Ramayan’s viewership with Game Of Thrones. I have watched GOT and I loved the show. I used to say it to my husband that I wished I could be a part of Game Of Thrones and then when I saw the post and the comparison of the views, I was surprised and overwhelmed.”
Sharing with us what kind of shows she is watching nowadays, Dipika Chiklia said, “I was watching The Last Kingdom recently which just got over and then I watched Vikings. I love these kinds of shows.”

It may be suffering for many, but the lockdown has happened to be a blessing in disguise for the TV channel Doordarshan and OTT platforms and for the movie buffs who are relying on these platforms for some entertainment. While OTT platforms have completely hooked us with the premiere of numerous shows and films, TV made our Coronavirus lockdown better by bringing mythological shows and some iconic shows again on Doordarshan. Ramanand Sagar's Ramayan that first aired in 1987 on DD national has been brought back for the audience in the middle of the novel Coronavirus.
The re-run of Ramayan has turned out to be a successful venture as it is currently sitting on the top spot of the TRP charts which is then followed by Mahabharat and many other shows. Not only this, Arun Govil, Dipika Chikhlia and Sunil Lahri starrer Ramayan has created a world record as it has become the most-watched shows.

Seeing so much love and appreciation the show has been getting after it’s re-run, Lakshman aka Sunil Lahri is overwhelmed and hence shared a video on his Instagram feed expressing that all the love has made him go speechless. While sharing the video, he captioned it as, “Thank you each and everyone for loving me and appreciating my work in Ramayan.”
We also went through his comment section where all his fans are in complete ‘awe’ of the actor and his character Lakshman – brother of Lord Ram. A fan commented, “Sir you have been an inspiration... It never looks you have been acting for the role of Lakshman Ji. To us you are our Lakshman ji. Thanks for giving life to this epic hero. Idolising you.. Jay shri Lakshman.”  ALSO READ: Ramayan: Sunil Lahri AKA Lakshman Reacts To Arun Govil AKA Ram’s ‘No Award’ Comment; ‘One Can Satisfy Their Ego When Felicitated’We also see another one wrote, “Sir sirrrre app ete pyare lgte ho ramayan mai ki bss ap hi dikhte rhe pure time ramayan khtm hone wala h sir plzz ap actice rhe apne id mai aur bhi movies kre plzzzz request h sir kroge to sir plzz reply kr dijiye.” One also wrote, “U r my all time favourite sir Puri dunia fan ban gyi h aapki.”ALSO READ: Kanika Kapoor Dethrones Priyanka Chopra Jonas In Most-Searched Indian Celeb List; Ramayan Tops Lockdown Entertainment Search

    <h5 class="mb-1">You Have To Use Cheats To See The Only Hidden Watermelon In Half-Life: Alyx</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Watermelons could be found hidden in a few spots throughout Half-Life 2. But for whatever reason only one melon is hidden in Half-Life: Alyx and it can’t even be seen unless players use console commands.
As documented in a recent video by Half-Life superfan MarphitimusBlackimus, there is a single melon in Half-Life: Alyx. It is hiding in a box early on in the game, in a section where Alyx is exploring a basement while Combine soldiers walk around outside the windows. However, this melon is actually hidden from the player’s sight unless they use “noclip” to leave the basement. Then and only then can you see the lone melon.
Things were much different back in Half-Life 2. In that game, released back in 2004, dedicated melon hunters could find six watermelons throughout the game. And a few more in deathmatch levels. MarphitimusBlackimus made a whole video about these melons too.
The new melon model seen in Alyx sports a brand new texture, looking better than the melons seen in Half-Life 2. Sadly, it can’t be broken into melon gibs. When shot it just poofs out of existence.
It seems in 2020 the budget for melons has been slashed. Maybe one day Valve will update Half-Life: Alyx to bring back the melons and right this wrong. They went back and patched the original Half-Life last year, 20 years after the game was first released.
I just don’t want to wait that long for my VR watermelons.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sia Debuts Timely Single ‘Saved My Life,’ Co-written by Dua Lipa</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sia debuted a surprise new single last night during Americares Foundation’s COVID-19 benefit livestream, aptly titled “Saved My Life.” The track is a classic Sia empowerment anthem co-written by fellow pop star Dua Lipa and produced by hitmaker Greg Kurstin. The livestream, called “COVID Is No Joke,” featured comedians and musicians like Steve Carell, Elizabeth Banks, Ike Barinholtz, Will Ferrell, Bryan Cranston, and Gal Gadot. Sia closed the event with “Saved My Life,” which she sang behind a lamp in order to obscure her face, as is her usual M.O. during performances. All proceeds from sales of “Saved My Life” will be donated to Americares and CORE Response’s COVID relief efforts. This is Sia’s second single in 2020, the first being “Original” from the motion-picture soundtrack of Dolittle back in January.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sia surprised all of her fans on Friday with new music.
The singer took part in the Americares’ “COVID Is No Joke” event where she first performed “Saved My Life” written by Dua Lipa. The song was then released on Saturday.
“Well, someone must have sent you here to save my life/ Someone must have sent you to save me tonight/ I know that in darkness I have found my light/ I know that in darkness I’ve been given sight,” Sia sings in the timely song.
The event which also featured Steve Carell, Elizabeth Banks, Ike Barinholtz, Jack Black and Tenacious D, Will Ferrell, Bryan Cranston, Gal Gadot and many more was held to raise funds for the nonprofit’s coronavirus-targeted health programs.
The full hour long fundraiser can be watched below:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Zoë Bell Fights Nearly Every Famous Woman in Hollywood in This Quarantine Fight Scene</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">One big gap in all of our nerd lives during the drought in Hollywood releases brought on by the pandemic is the lack of good fight choreography. Crunchy, thrilling, silly, engaging fight scenes are some of my biggest delights in genre fiction, and oh, do I miss them. So does stuntwoman, actress, and stunt choreographer Zoë Bell. So she did what she could.
In a lockdown-style video (you know the drill by now, a bunch of personally shot little clips threaded together), Bell recruits some of the coolest and most dashing women in Hollywood to throw down. Or, as she puts it, “play a game.” Bell, the stunt double for stars like Lucy Lawless in Xena or Uma Thurman in her role as The Bride in Kill Bill, is extremely well connected, so the list of stars she’s able to pull here is pretty stunning.
Like, have you ever wanted to see Florence Pugh throw down with Hallie Berry? Zoe Saldana vs. Thandie Newton? Margot Robbie vs. Cameron Diaz? Well, this video will give you a little taste of that action. It’s not quite the same as a full-on Hollywood fight scene, but it’s plenty fun. It even works in some great fight scene tropes, including the furious realisation that, hey, I’m bleeding! and the waffling to find a weapon that you’re willing to break over your opponent’s head. There’s also a cameo appearance from, well, I’ll let you guess which one I’m talking about.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bolshoi ballet soloists limber up in lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Moscow, Russia | AFP |  In the middle of their bedroom, Bolshoi ballet dancers Margarita Shrainer and Igor Tsvirko have placed a linoleum mat and a barre.
Since the start of the lockdown, the couple, both soloists in the legendary troupe, have largely used their own initiative to keep up their dance skills at home.
The Bolshoi held its first online classes only this week, more than a month after lockdown began.
Yet Tsvirko and Shrainer still look toned and Tsvirko pulls at his waistband.
“I don’t think I’ve got fat, that’s the main thing,” says the 30-year-old dancer, a leading soloist at the Bolshoi who has performed lead roles in “Ivan the Terrible” and “Nureyev”.
Shrainer, a first soloist who has performed major roles in “Coppelia” and “Carmen Suite”, massages her leg with a tennis ball and moves into the splits.
Together for more than a year, they are living in a studio flat owned by the theatre.
The same block is home to several other dancers and it was outside this building that the notorious acid attack on then-artistic director Sergei Filin took place in 2013.
Their Zoom class is led by a teacher doing steps in his bedroom to a piano accompaniment.
There are leaps and energetic dance routines. At the end, Shrainer sits with her legs stretched out in front of her.
“We got some cardio,” the 26-year-old says.
Afterwards they goof around, Tsvirko performing lifts with Shrainer.
“As for dancing as a duo, yes we probably are lucky that we can keep up this form,” Shrainer says.
The dancers had to find their own ways to create a lockdown routine and find equipment.
– ‘Only stronger’ –
As lockdown began, “the Bolshoi gave very important and worthwhile advice: keep yourself fit and find a way to do ballet in self-isolation,” says Tsvirko.
“That’s what we performers are doing: finding linoleum, barres.”
Normally dancers do not train at home so do not have such equipment, Tsvirko says.
As they spoke, the theatre brought round rolls of black dance linoleum, a special type with a strong grip.
Even their ballet shoes are “wearing out” as they cannot collect new supplies, Tsvirko says.
The theatre’s general director Vladimir Urin told Kommersant daily in early April that it was unfeasible to hold online classes for the 250-strong troupe.
Tsvirko suggests the management did not initially see how online video conferences could be used.
“I think it’s primarily due to the fact that some people weren’t familiar with technical innovations that exist now.”
General director Urin has said his “good” scenario is for the theatre to reopen for the new season in September and Tsvirko says he anticipates such a timeframe.
“I doubt anyone will start working before September or anything will open so I’ve steeled myself for such long holidays.”
Meanwhile both are developing hobbies.
Tsvirko is learning to play the guitar while Shrainer has got into cooking, pilates and learning English.
She says she misses the bustle of the theatre: “There’s not the usual pace, rhythm, constant rehearsals, meeting colleagues, sitting in the cafeteria.”
Tsvirko says he misses the anticipation ahead of going on stage.
“That atmosphere when you come in and warm up and you talk to your favourite wardrobe masters, your makeup artists — that process of going in, the slight butterflies, that’s probably what I miss most.”
Going back will not be easy, they acknowledge.
“After such a long time of strict precautionary measures, how will men even shake hands? I think everyone will be keeping their distance a bit,” predicts Shrainer.
Physically there will also be “a tough comeback period for the performers, of regaining strength,” she says.
Theatre-goers will be changed too, says Tsvirko. “Audiences will definitely observe precautions: probably they’ll sit in masks and gloves.”
Beyond the virus, the economic realities have changed, he adds.
“Russia for sure is also in an economic crisis, like the whole world basically, so the question is the cost of tickets.”
Urin told Kommersant that he fears opening later than September could mean financial disaster due to planned premieres.
But the dancers are ultimately optimistic the revered troupe will return with renewed energy.
“I hope people won’t get weaker over this time but only stronger,” says Tsvirko.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BTS Thanks Fans For Voting Them As Favorite Music Group On KCAs: ‘This Is Amazing’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BTS is back on American airwaves! All seven of the guys — J-Hope, Suga, Jungkook, V, Jimin, Jin, and RM — popped up on Nickelodeons’ Kids’ Choice Awards on May 2 to accept their blimp for Favorite Music Group. As the orange award hilariously “flew” into the room, RM, 25, spoke on the groups’ behalf. “What up, what up?” he began, sporting a white t-shirt with a multi-colored image and black jeans. “Favorite music group at Kids’ Choice Awards! Wow, this is amazing, thank you so much! So happy to get this award,” he added, as the rest of the group cheered on. “We sent this blimp around the world for you guys!” host Victoria Justice said, before cutting to the short video.
Earlier in the day, Jungkook, 22, nearly broke the internet with an epic cover of ballad “Never Not” by Lauv. “We were so beautiful/We were so tragic/No other magic could ever compare/Lost myself, seventeen,” he sang along to a guitar melody, showing off his impeccable vocals. Jungkook was casual in just an oversized gray t-shirt and beige pants as he belted out the emotional ballad sitting on his bed. “Never Not,” the official BTS twitter account posted, adding a purple heart.
The boys are always known for their impeccable style, and Jimin even had a viral moment just last week for his silver Chanel chain necklace! The eye-catching diamond piece featured the legendary brands’ iconic CC interlock, along with several colored gemstones. Jin also showed off their swag with with a denim Balenciaga logo jacket, while Yoongi rocked a t-shirt from Justin Bieber‘s go-to line Essentials.
BTS recently had fans begging for a collaboration with rapper Daddy Yankee after Suga, Jin and Jimin busted a move to his track “Con Calma”! The video was posted to their WeVerse account, and they showed off their insane choreography to the club-ready tune. While there’s no word on whether or not fans’ wishes will be coming true, it would be epic if it was true!

    <h5 class="mb-1">BTS’ Jungkook Breaks The Internet⁠ (Again⁠) With Twitter’s Most-Liked Tweet This Week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jungkook, a member of beloved K-pop crew BTS, posted a video of himself singing on Twitter—and proceeded to break the Internet yet again⁠—in a tweet⁠ that received the most likes this week, according to data compiled by the social media tracking firm NewsWhip.
Jungkook, 22, sings a cover of BTS collaborator Lauv’s “Never Not” in the video, while the tweet is just two words: the song title, accompanied by a purple heart emoji.
As of Sunday afternoon (and 24 hours after the tweet posted) it had pulled in over 2.1 million likes and nearly 900,000 retweets.
In 2019, Forbes named BTS the world’s highest paid boy band and K-pop act with $57 million in pretax income.
Jungkook has a history of breaking the Internet; in 2018, Twitter Korea said a video of him singing was South Korea’s most-retweeted of the year.
Jungkook also wields massive influence over fans, with Merlot March wine, Downy laundry detergent and book I Decided To Live As Me all selling out once fans learned he liked those items.
NewsWhip’s Twitter engagement data comes from its database of influential users, which tracks around 350,000 accounts.
176 weeks. That’s how long BTS has been number one on Billboard’s Social 50, a list of the musical artists with the most social media reach. 
BTS, which has seven members, is the best-selling musical artist in South Korean history with over 20 million albums sold. In 2019, Big Hit Entertainment, the Seoul-based company that manages BTS, pulled in $63 million on a record $507 million in revenue. As of April 29, however, Big Hit postponed the group’s upcoming dates and refunded ticket purchases due to the coronavirus pandemic. Big Hit’s financial outlook, as with many other industries, remains murky as the virus continues to spread. “The lack of live events now makes the firm’s digital strategy especially critical,” writes Forbes’ Grace Chung. Beginning around 2011, Big Hit built a rabid BTS social following on Twitter, as well as YouTube and Instagram, by sharing moments (rehearsals, eating dinner) that made the band seem more relatable to fans. 
BTS is short for the Korean phrase “Bangtan Sonyeondan,” or 방탄소년단, which translates to “Bulletproof Boy Scouts.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tony Allen, Drummer Who Created the Beat of Afrobeat, Dies at 79</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tony Allen, the drummer who created the steadfast, subtle beat of the Nigerian protest funk known as Afrobeat, died on Thursday in Paris. He was 79.
His manager, Eric Trosset, said the cause was an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
From 1964 to 1978, Mr. Allen worked with the bandleader Fela Ransome-Kuti, who became known worldwide simply as Fela. He was the musical director for Fela’s band Africa 70, which forged music that was both politically committed and danceable, merging West African styles with American jazz and funk.
Mr. Allen made more than three dozen albums with Fela and the band, including the indelible “Zombie” and “Gentleman,” as well as solo albums on which Mr. Allen led Africa 70. The music of Fela and Africa 70 reached listeners and emulators all over the world. On Twitter, Peter Gabriel wrote, “As a musician & aspiring drummer, it was thrilling to get lost in their new, smart, sexy & political music full of killer grooves.”
The songs that defined Afrobeat, with Mr. Allen’s drumming at their core, move at a deliberate, unhurried tempo, geared for marathon six-hour sets and dancing until dawn. On albums, many of Fela’s 1970s Afrobeat songs stretched the length of an LP side.
While Fela composed the parts for the band’s other instruments, Mr. Allen created his own drum parts. His playing was open-ended and improvisatory rather than bluntly repetitive; complex patterns drove a shifting dialogue with every element of the band. “You listen to it flowing like a river,” Mr. Allen explained in a 2016 interview with The Guardian.
After he left Africa 70 in 1979, Mr. Allen went on to an international solo career, leading his own bands and collaborating with rock, jazz, reggae, R&B and electronic musicians. The composer and producer Brian Eno, a fan since the 1970s, once called Mr. Allen “perhaps the greatest drummer who ever lived.”
Tony Oladipo Allen was born on Aug. 12, 1940, in Lagos, then the capital of Nigeria. He was the eldest of six children of James Alabi Allen, a Nigerian auto mechanic, and Prudencia Anna (Mettle) Allen, whose family was from Ghana.
As a teenager he learned electronics and worked as a radio technician — skills that would come in handy in his early days as a touring musician, when he repaired the band’s amplifiers. He didn’t start playing drums until he was 18.
He had grown up listening to West African music, but he also immersed himself in jazz, studying the drumming of Gene Krupa, Art Blakey, Max Roach, Elvin Jones, Philly Joe Jones, Tony Williams and others. “These guys were telling a story by playing different rhythms, and they were doing it with independent coordination,” he said in the 2013 book “Tony Allen: An Autobiography of the Master Drummer of Afrobeat,” which he wrote with Michael Veal. “That’s the way the drums should be played, man.”
As he taught himself to play, Mr. Allen became particularly interested in the pedal-operated pair of cymbals known as the hi-hat, which he felt other African drummers neglected. The whoosh, rustle and ping of his hi-hats animated Mr. Allen’s drumming with an additional layer of polyrhythm.
“I’m creating different patterns with my four limbs,” Mr. Allen told The Guardian in 2014. “They are all playing something different, which means you need to split your mind into four elements with the one central idea running through.”
Martin Perna, the founder of the Brooklyn-based Afrobeat band Antibalas, which performed with Mr. Allen in the 2000s, said Mr. Allen “was the embodiment of rhythm.” He added, “What’s so magical is with all that variation, he’s somehow more hypnotic than a pattern that doesn’t change.”
Mr. Allen soon found work in Lagos highlife bands and groups that played whatever was popular. In 1964 he auditioned for Fela Ransome-Kuti, who was putting together a jazz band, beginning a 15-year musical alliance that survived chronic disputes over getting paid.
That first band’s pure jazz drew only small audiences, and Fela soon decided to combine jazz with African pop; as Fela Ransome-Kuti and His Koola Lobitos, the band played what it called “highlife jazz.”
The group toured Nigeria and neighboring Ghana. In the late 1960s a Ghanaian promoter, Raymond Aziz, came up with a new name for their musical hybrid: Afrobeat.
During a lengthy stay in Los Angeles in 1969 when the band was on tour in the United States, Fela grew politicized by the Black Power movement. When the band returned to Nigeria, Fela renamed it first Nigeria 70 and then Africa 70. His new songs were more streamlined and merged James Brown-style funk with Mr. Allen’s rolling, crackling rhythms.
“I had developed the drumming concept for Afrobeat from many things that I heard while I was growing up,” Mr. Allen said in his autobiography. “It was a fusion of beats and patterns. There was highlife, there was local Yoruba music like apala and sakara, there was jazz, and there was Western popular music like funk and R&B.”
Fela’s new songs also carried messages, at first couched in proverbs and then increasingly direct, that condemned corruption and taunted Nigeria’s military dictatorship. Although Fela and Africa 70 recorded extensively and performed regularly at his club, the Shrine, Fela was repeatedly arrested and beaten.
Africa 70 persisted, and Mr. Allen stayed on as bandleader until September 1978, when, after years of feeling musically fulfilled but financially exploited, he quit.
Mr. Allen was backed by Africa 70 on his 1979 album, “No Accommodation for Lagos,” but he struggled to start his own band in Nigeria. Eventually, after recording in London, he settled in Paris in 1985.
In 1987 he married Sylvie Nicollet. She survives him, as do their three sons and four children from an earlier relationship in Nigeria, along with grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He lived in Courbevoie, a suburb of Paris.
Mr. Allen was frustrated with the first recordings he made in France, on which trendy-minded producers smothered his drumming with electronics. But in the 1990s he forged the blend of Afrobeat and dub electronics that he wanted on “Black Voices,” which featured guest appearances by singers from Parliament-Funkadelic. He found more compatible collaborators in the next decades.
A longtime fan, Damon Albarn of Blur and Gorillaz, appeared on Mr. Allen’s 2002 album, “Home Cooking,” starting a long affiliation. Mr. Allen joined Mr. Albarn in the band the Good, the Bad and the Queen and in a project with Flea, the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ bassist, called Rocket Juice & the Moon. He also made small-group jazz albums and recorded with the reggae guitarist Ernest Ranglin and the techno producer Jeff Mills. This year he completed “Rejoice,” an album featuring the South African trumpeter Hugh Masekela that was begun at sessions in 2010. On Saturday, Gorillaz released a new song with Mr. Allen and the grime rapper Skepta, “How Far?”
“I still challenge myself every time with my playing,” Mr. Allen wrote in his autobiography. “I still want to play something impossible, something that I never played before. That’s what I’m after.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This is not the news anyone wanted to hear, Adam Lambert and Christina Aguilera were set to tour together this summer but have just cancelled the unannounced tour.
Lambert revealed the secret tour on Twitter on Sunday.
“You know what’s funny? There was a whole plan to tour w @xtina this summer around the US. Big venues too! But unfortunately everything went into Lock Down before we were ready to announce. Y’all know I’m an OG Christina Aguilera fan. ❤️ waiting time see if we can reschedule it,” he wrote.
While he does note that he hopes to reschedule the dates, it didn’t stop Twitter from going into full panic mode.
Lambert and Queen also had to postpone their tour dates due to COVID-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pre-Coronavirus, Adam Lambert & Christina Aguilera Were Set to Tour Together</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Before the global coronavirus pandemic shut down the concert industry, an Adam Lambert and Christina Aguilera summer tour was in the works.
"There was a whole plan to tour w @xtina this summer around the US. Big venues too!" Lambert, a self-professed "OG Christina Aguilera fan," revealed on Twitter Sunday afternoon (May 3). "But unfortunately everything went into Lock Down before we were ready to announce."
To the relief of fans freaking out in the comments section, he added that they are waiting to see if they'll be able to reschedule those dates.
Lambert dropped the surprising news in response to a tweeted suggestion that the pair live stream together from their homes for a duet of "Just a Fool," the Lotus album track that Aguilera ended up recording with Blake Shelton; before that, Lambert had actually recorded a demo of the track.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Christone “Kingfish” Ingram was the big winner at the Blues Foundation’s 2020 Blues Music Awards on Sunday (May 3).
The blues guitarist and singer took home five awards, including album of the year, best emerging artist album and best contemporary blues album for his debut, Kingfish. He also won instrumentalist-guitarist and best contemporary blues artist.
The awards show became a virtual ceremony with all artists sheltering in place and presenting, accepting and performing remotely after the COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible to gather live in Memphis, as had been planned. The awards were broadcast on The Blues Foundation’s Facebook page and YouTube channel.
Nick Moss and his band featuring Dennis Gruenling won two awards for band of the year and traditional blues album for Lucky Guy!, while Moss took home the statue for song of the year for "Lucky Guy." Last year’s soul blues male artist award winner, Sugaray Rayford, claimed that prize again this year along with the B.B. King entertainer of the year award.
A number of legends already inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame added to their trophy case: Mavis Staples claimed the vocalist award, Bobby Rush -- who recently recovered after a COVID-19 scare -- won in soul blues album for Sitting on Top of the Blues, and Bettye LaVette took home the soul blues female artist award.
Presenters included Charlie Musselwhite, Warren Haynes, Fantastic Negrito, Ruthie Foster, William Bell, Beth Hart and Keb’ Mo. Additionally, Bonnie Raitt, Steve Miller, Robert Cray,Dion and Little Steven Van Zandt took part in the ceremony, providing words of inspiration for nominees.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby 'quits Celebrity Juice' after 12 years on the popular TV show</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has dropped a television bombshell – she’s quit Celebrity Juice.
The 39-year-old This Morning presenter has been a team captain on Keith Lemon’s raunchy late night quiz show for 12 years – but has called time on her involvement on the show in order to spend more time with her family.
Holly has three young children with her 45-year-old producer husband Dan Baldwin, while a string of lockdown special episodes of the madcap quiz show are due to be the last to feature the blonde beauty.
Taking part on the raunchy show has allowed Holly – who is mum to 10-year-old son Harry, eight-year-old daughter Belle, and five-year-old Chester – to show off a wilder side compared to her mild mannered daytime talkshow hostess role.
But now Holly is hanging up her captain’s hat – two years after fellow original captain Fearne Cotton quit the show in 2018.
A show source told The Sun on Sunday: “Holly has absolutely loved her time on the show — it’s been a huge part of her life, and has really helped to expand her fanbase over the years.
“But she feels now is the right time to bow out and wants to free up a bit more of her busy schedule to spend with her family.”
They added: “She’s still the best of pals with Leigh Francis and will continue to support the series.”
Keith paid tribute to Holly with an f-bomb video clip that he shared on Instagram just hours before news of her quitting his show broke.
A short clip showed Keith – who is the alter ego of 47-year-old comedian Leigh Francis – reacting in shock as Holly screamed “F***!” at the camera.
He captioned the moment: “Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in. One of the boys but all woman.
“A wicked sense of humour and very easy to look at. Don’t look into her eyes though, cos she can make you do anything. What a lady!”
He added: "The one and only @hollywilloughby face of an angel but can have the potty mouth of... well me I guess."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holly Willoughby QUITS Celebrity Juice 12 years after ITV panel show helped make her a household name</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Holly Willoughby has quit ITV’s Celebrity Juice – the show that helped make her a household name – after 12 years.
The presenter will end her reign as a team captain on the award-winning panel show at the end of the current series.
Insiders say the decision comes as a blow to programming chiefs, who have long relied on her star quality to attract viewers.
Although 39-year-old Miss Willoughby had worked in television for several years before Celebrity Juice, landing the role on the show in 2008 helped make her TV hot property.
She joined This Morning a year later and still hosts the show with Phillip Schofield. Celebrity Juice is also where the term ‘Holly Willoughbooby’ was coined to described her curvaceous figure.
Her resignation comes shortly after her husband Dan Baldwin – one of Celebrity Juice’s creators – stopped producing the ITV2 show. 
The mother of three’s departure now throws the future of the series into doubt after its host Keith Lemon, the comic alter-ego of Leigh Francis, said it would be over if she quit. 
A friend of Miss Willoughby told The Mail on Sunday: ‘She absolutely loves being on the show, she has loved it but she felt it was time now. 
'She wants to spend more time with her family, filming Celebrity Juice takes up an evening that she could be spending with her family.
‘She is, after all, one of the busiest women in showbiz.’
Yesterday, Francis paid tribute to Miss Willoughby on Instagram under his guise as Keith Lemon, saying: ‘Love this woman. What an incredible sport. Always willing to get her hands dirty and join in. One of the boys but all woman.’ A spokesman for Miss Willoughby last night declined to comment.
It is believed the star will make an announcement on Sunday May 3.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lionsgate has put together a new theatrical calendar compensating for the disruption in distribution schedules and production caused by the novel coronavirus. While these are very much still subject to change, it looks like we’ve got some new dates for a lot of interesting stuff.
The biggest is John Wick 4, which is being delayed an entire year. Pushed back from its original May 21, 2021 date, it will now release on May 27, 2022. But something from Lionsgate will be releasing on that date: Chris Rock’s Spiral, the next entry in the Saw franchise.
As for other genre fare, the embattled Chaos Walking starring Daisy Ridley and Tom Holland will keep its current release date, premiering at theatres in our post-apocalyptic future of January 22, 2021. The sci-fi film Voyagers, starring Colin Farrel, Tye Sheridan, and Lily-Rose Depp, will come out November 25, 2020. And The Devil’s Light, a supernatural thriller set to be directed by James Hawes (Black Mirror, Penny Dreadful), will come out January 8, 2021.
As a fan of the ongoing and forever in our hearts Keanussaince, the delay of the next John Wick movie is both the most notable and the most painful item on this list, and I call on Warner Bros. to follow suit by delaying the next Matrix film so that we can continue to have the double Keanu holiday we all deserve and will, frankly, need. 
Editor's Note: This article has the US release date. We will update this article as soon as possible with an Australian release date, if available.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gil Schwartz, aka humorist Stanley Bing, has died at 68</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES (AP) — Gil Schwartz, the longtime CBS communications executive who wrote humorous novels and columns under the pen name Stanley Bing, has died. He was 68.
CBS representatives said Sunday that Schwartz died Saturday at his home in Santa Monica, California. His death, they said, was unexpected, but due to natural causes.
Schwartz had a distinguished nearly 40-year career in corporate America with CBS, Viacom and Westinghouse Broadcasting. He retired in 2018 from his post as senior executive vice president and chief communications officer of CBS Corporation.
But unlike most of his peers, Schwartz had a once-secret and then public side career as a lauded humorist and writer of 13 books who satirized the business world he was part of. Under the pseudonym Stanley Bing, Schwartz wrote a column in Esquire for 13 years and then in Fortune. One, “Executive Summary: Stanley Bing,” from 1991, describes an unwelcome 40th birthday in the style of a corporate presentation.
“You’ll have to excuse me if I sound a little morose. I am morose,” he wrote. “This corporation recently celebrated its fortieth anniversary of operations. Quite a few parties were held in its honor, and they succeeded in getting this speaker somewhat depressed in the way that only enforced merriment truly can.”
Although he was able to hold the dual identities in secret for a while, in the 1990s, it became “the most poorly held secret in the media business.”
Advertising
“Bing’s” books included “Crazy Bosses: Spotting Them, Serving Them, Surviving Them,” “You Look Nice Today,” “Lloyd: What Happened,” and “Immortal Life: A Soon to Be True Story.”
Born in New York City in 1951, Schwartz studied theater arts and English at Brandeis University. He was a renaissance man: A poet, playwright, actor, guitarist and photographer of birds, food and travel.
Schwartz is survived by his wife of 14 years, Laura Svienty, two children, two step children and two grandchildren. The statement says a memorial service will take place in the fall. In lieu of flowers, the family requests anyone seeking to honor Schwartz donate to lafoodbank.org, foodbanknyc.org or sfmfoodbank.org.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kylie Jenner Shows Off Toned Abs After Revealing Latest Kylie Skin Drop — See Pic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kylie Jenner, 22, is glammed up in quarantine! The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star flashed her toned abs in her latest Instagram photo posted on Saturday, May 2. Standing by a dark gray door in her swanky new $36.5 Holmby Hills mansion, Kylie gave the camera a seductive look as she lifted her Chrome Hearts hoodie. The black sweatshirt featured a silver cross-emblem at the zipper and a white pattern along the left arm, while the matching pants read “Chrome Hearts” on the left leg. As always, her makeup was flawless with a peach matte lip, hint of a gold eye shadow and black winged eye liner!
Kylie has kept her honey highlights going since social distancing, showing off the pretty hue in with her long side ponytail. “Trolls&chill ?” she captioned the image, adding a white heart. Trolls, of course, is her 2-year-old daughter Stormi‘s favorite movie! The California native showed Stormi watching the newly released sequel Trolls World Tour with Stassie Karanikolaou, 22, at-home and the duo looked like they were having a blast as they jumped up and down in front of the TV! Little Stormi even had the honor of being turned into her very own Trolls character, which Kylie shared to her Instagram just three weeks ago!
The makeup mogul’s latest post comes fresh off the announcement of her latest Kylie Skin drop: an exfoliating sugar lip scrub! “Shhh my newest obsession launches this month,” she wrote over a video posted May 2, showing off the pastel pink box while Victoria Monet‘s “Dive” played in the background. “Yum,” she wrote over another photo, revealing the light, golden brown color of the product along with the mini pink scooper. “Hands down the best duo,” she added over a third image, showing her sold-out Hydrating Lip Mask alongside the brand new scrub!
Kylie’s tanning game has been on point since she began social distancing, spending time at her mom Kris Jenner‘s Palm Springs home before moving into her brand new resort-style mansion! With BFF Stassie by her side, the pair have been soaking up the sun in her pool cabanas in their revealing bikinis. Kylie nearly broke the internet with her super sexy video post that showed her spraying on her Kylie Skin sunscreen oil on April 27, and again her multi-colored two-piece on April 28!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Anastasiya Kvitko Flaunts Her Voluptuous Physique In A Tiny Black Bikini</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Ava Bennet
Russian bombshell Anastasiya Kvitko tantalized her 10.8 million Instagram followers with her latest post, in which she showed off her buxom body in a skimpy black bikini. The scandalous swimsuit was from the brand PrettyLittleThing, and Anastasiya made sure to tag the brand in the picture itself as well as in the caption of the post.
Anastasiya didn’t include a geotag on the post that indicated where the snap was taken, but she perched on a large outdoor couch with cushions behind her and what appeared to be a larger patio surrounding it. Anastasiya showcased her hourglass physique in a skimpy black bikini that left little to the imagination. The bikini top featured small triangular cups that looked barely able to contain her ample assets, with thin strings connecting the cups and stretching around her neck. The top showed off a serious amount of cleavage, as well as a flash of under boob.
She paired the skimpy top with equally tiny black bikini bottoms. The bottoms dipped low in the front, showing off some of her toned stomach, and stretched high over her hips. The high-cut style accentuated her slim waist and emphasized her hourglass physique.
Anastasiya added a splash of color with her accessories, topping the simple bikini with a bright pink cover-up that she draped over her shoulders. The fabric flowed down around her, covering her arms while leaving the rest of her body exposed. She rocked a pair of pink sandals as well, and had a structured pink bag on the seat beside her. Anastasiya also added a few gold bracelets and a pair of sunglasses to finish the look.
Her long blond locks cascaded down her chest in a sleek style, and she had minimal makeup on in the shot. Her followers absolutely loved the sizzling update, and the post racked up over 29,100 likes within just 53 minutes. In less than an hour, the post also racked up 674 comments from her eager fans.
“This look,” one fan said simply, followed by two heart eyes emoji.
“Absolutely stunning love!! You look incredible!!” another follower commented.
“So incredibly beautiful my lovely sweetheart Anastasiya,” one fan said, including a string of heart emoji in the comment.
“Magnificently the most beautiful creature on this planet,” another follower added.
Anastasiya loves to flaunt her curvaceous physique, no matter what she’s wearing. She always seems to find ensembles that showcase her hourglass figure, such as the look she wore on her Instagram page just a few days ago. As The Inquisitr reported, Anastasiya shared a short video clip intended to promote Bang Energy, a beverage company. Anastasiya showed off her voluptuous figure in a skintight gray mini dress that looked smoking hot on her physique.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WWE News: Becky Lynch Takes Hilarious Dig At Her Critics On Twitter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Kieran Fisher
Becky Lynch has been absent from Monday Night Raw in recent weeks, and she’s been talking about her acting ambitions over the weekend. There is also a rumor going around stating that she’s joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe, though it’s yet to be confirmed or denied by “The Man” at the time of this writing. All of these factors combined have turned some fans against the Raw Women’s Champion, as they believe she’s no longer dedicated to WWE.
On Saturday, Lynch decided to respond to these angry fans by trolling them on social media. “The Man” took to Twitter and shared a cover for a fictional publication called Part Timer Magazine, featuring an image of her on the front cover.
In addition to the photo, the cover also features a couple of headlines for news stories pertaining to Lynch. One of them pokes fun at members of the WWE Universe who are angry at “The Man” for defeating all of their favorite superstars on Monday Night Raw. In the second headline, she highlights the fact that she’s lived up to all of her promises as a WWE superstar.
Eagle-eyed Twitter users also spotted a tattoo on her arm which says “Messiah 4eva,” which is a reference to her boyfriend Seth Rollins, who’s been a polarizing superstar in recent times. Lynch went all out to laugh at the expense of her haters, suggesting that she hasn’t taken any of the criticism to heart.
While Lynch’s absence from WWE television is mostly a result of the current pandemic, some fans have soured on “The Man” as she has held her title for over a year. She also defeated Shayna Baszler at this year’s WrestleMania, and in doing so, some fans and pundits believe that she damaged the promising star’s momentum.
Of course, some fans are also worried that she’s only using WWE as a launchpad in order to make a full-time transition into Hollywood. However, “The Man” has stated that she doesn’t plan on hanging up her wrestling boots any time soon, and is simply pursuing a second career.
Lynch’s mainstream marketability has increased significantly over the last year or so, and receiving offers to star in movies in television shows was always inevitable. It remains to be seen if the bright lights of Hollywood will be more alluring than WWE in the coming years, but “The Man” has worked hard for all of the opportunities coming her way.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Becky Lynch takes hilarious dig at fans who dislike her</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Becky Lynch has taken to Twitter to take a dig at the ‘haters’ by posting a fake magazine cover. The WWE RAW Women's Champion has not been in a feud recently and been labeled a part-timer by several fans as she is going to be a part of a Marvel movie.
Becky took sly digs at the fans by adding witty texts in the fake magazine cover. She also added a small 'messiah 4EVA' text on her arm like a white ink tattoo.
The RAW Women's Champion was expected to drop her title at WrestleMania to Shayna Basler but managed to overcome the odds. Becky Lynch is not a part of any feud now and is expected to take on the winner of the Women's Money in the Bank Ladder Match next Sunday.
She is not scheduled to appear on the pay-per-view but there is still a week left and with her being a part of shows and movies, WWE might take the title off Becky Lynch sooner than expected.
The Man was already confirmed to appear on Billions on Showtime and now, Hollywood reporter, Kris Tapley has confirmed that she will be in a Marvel movie too. John Cena and The Rock are reportedly helping her get ready for Hollywood.

    <h5 class="mb-1">BGT fans in disbelief over hopeful's real age as she performs with young daughter</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain’s Got Talent 2020 viewers were left sharing their disbelief over one hopeful's age on Saturday night, as she took to the stage with her young daughter.
Singing duo Honey and Sammy wowed the judges and fans with their moving rendition of Freya Ridings’ Lost Without You.
They went on to win Amanda Holden’s Golden Buzzer in emotional scenes, with the judge in tears.
But before they’d even started singing, viewers watching at home were stunned over something mum Sammy said.
Asked by Simon Cowell for her age, after confirming her daughter was 14, Sammy revealed that she was 43 years old.
Stunning Sammy’s youthful looks left viewers in shock though, with many believing she was much younger.
Taking to twitter, they couldn't believe her real age and some even thought the girls were sisters.
One fan commented: "Bloody hell is that really her mum."
Another said: "43? she looks fantastic #BGT #BritainsGotTalent."
A third tweeted: "Omg they look like sisters!!"
The pair were stopped mid performance by Simon Cowell, with him asking for a different song.
A little later the mother and daughter returned, and left the judges speechless with their audition.
Amanda was moved to tears and praised the pair, before hitting her Golden Buzzer.
Sammy and Honey burst into tears, as Amanda joined them on stage.
Britain's Got Talent continues Saturdays at 8pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rage Against the Machine have cancelled their Electric Picnic appearance</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's more bad news for festival-goers today as Electric Picnic headliners Rage Against the Machine have axed their 2020 tour, including their planned appearance at Stradbally.
The band has announced that they are rescheduling their 2020 reunion tour due to the coronavirus pandemic.
They were due to play at the festival in Laois in September.
The said in a statement: "Rage Against the Machine will commence our tour at such a time when we are confident it will be safe for our fans. The rerouted dates (heath and safety permitting) are below and YOUR TICKETS WILL BE HONOURED for the postponed shows.
"During this difficult time, we also respect the fans who want their money back. We've requested and confirmed that, as of this weekend, anyone who wants a refund can begin the process at your point of purchase.
“We sincerely hope that each one of you and your families and friends stay safe and well and that music is bringing you solace and inspiration. We look forward to seeing you."
It's disappointing news for fans, who haven't seen the band play here in over ten years.
We suggest you could find some comfort in this tweet at least...
It is not sure what this development means yet for EP ticket holders - but many expect the event to be cancelled or postponed due to the ongoing crisis.
While the Government's new five-stage exit strategy allows for festivals and gathering from August 10, social distancing must be upheld - which won't exactly be straightforward at a music festival.
Only time will tell.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Electric Picnic headline act postpones entire 2020 tour and offers refunds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An Electric Picnic 2020 headline band has pulled the plug on its tour this year due to Covid-19 and have also offered refunds.
Rage Against the Machine announced that they rescheduled 2020 reunion tour due to the coronavirus pandemic. The band was due to play at the festival in Laois to be held over the first weekend of September.
“Rage Against the Machine will commence our tour at such a time when we are confident it will be safe for our fans. The rerouted dates (heath and safety permitting) are below and YOUR TICKETS WILL BE HONOURED for the postponed shows.
"During this difficult time, we also respect the fans who want their money back. We've requested and confirmed that, as of this weekend, anyone who wants a refund can begin the process at your point of purchase.
“We sincerely hope that each one of you and your families and friends stay safe and well and that music is bringing you solace and inspiration. We look forward to seeing you,” it concluded.
It is not clear how this impacts Electric Picnic tickets.
The band was the first to be announced for this year's event in Stradbally.
The Electric Picnic organisers lodge an application with Laois County Council for a licence in mid-April but the process of considering it has been delayed by the Covid-19 lockdown in Ireland.
Electric Picnic sister festivals in Ireland, Longitude and Kaleidoscope have already been called off.
A Rage Against the Machine handwashing video went viral earlier this year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent: Fans 'crying' as Honey and Sammy get Golden Buzzer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Britain’s Got Talent fans are feeling very emotional tonight as mother and daughter duo Honey and Sammy were chosen as Amanda Holden’s Golden Buzzer act.
They stunned audiences with their performance of Lost Without You by Freya Ridings, after previously being asked to return with a second song after an unsuccessful performance of a song from the musical Waitress.
To make it even more emotional, Honey said they were entering the competition as a testament to their bond as Sammy recovered from cancer treatment.
‘In the past couple of years my mum got diagnosed with cancer,’ Honey began. ‘It has been a tough couple of years and to be here with my mum is the best thing that has happened to me.
After their performance had the entire audience onto their feet, Amanda pressed her Golden Buzzer and sent Honey and Sammy straight through the live semi-finals.
And its fair to say that viewers are now crying just like us.
‘Golden Buzzer! Yes! Amazing!’ One fan wrote. ‘They deserve that moment. Crying at this!’
Another teary fan added: ‘Every time someone pressed that golden buzzer I end up crying!’
Same, hun, same.
‘I’m trying not to cry,’ a viewer admitted .’I’m not crying. Not crying!’
Don’t worry babes, we’re all with you, do you want a tissue?
Honey and Sammy now join the other Golden Buzzer acts to go through this series, including 12-year-old music prodigy Fayth Ifil.
Britain Got Talent airs Saturdays at 8pm on ITV.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Britain's Got Talent fans divided over Amanda's Golden Buzzer act</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fans of Britain's Got Talent have accused the show of being a 'set up' after a mum and daughter duo won Amanda's heart.
14-year-old Honey and her mum arrived on stage and Honey confessed she had signed them up for the talent show.
She then told how her mum had been diagnosed with cancer and after a rough couple of years, things were finally looking up for them.

They began by singing a song from the musical Waitress, but Simon stopped them midway through.
He told them he didn't like the song and he wanted them to go away and learn another then come back later in the day.
The duo exited the stage, and then came back just 15 minutes later to perform again.
Even Simon was shocked they had returned so soon, saying he was expecting them later in the show.
Mum Sammy admitted she had the lyrics on her hands before they belted out Freya Ridings' Lost Without You.
The judges all thought they were amazing, Simon told them he would remember their audition for a really long time.
Amanda was so moved she decided to push her Golden Buzzer.
Simon told her: "They really deserved that."
But viewers at home were far from convinced.
They accused the whole thing of being a set up.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gordon Ramsay wears his daughter's dress in hilarious new viral TikTok video</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Television chef Gordon Ramsay has posted a hilarious new video on TikTok where he wears his daughter's dress.
The Hell's Kitchen icon, 53, has gotten on board with the social media video hype and has now posted a new clip with daughter Matilda.
The two have been staying in Ramsay's Cornwall home and decided to take part in the Flip The Switch challenge.
The footage sees the pair dance along, with Matilda stirring her saucepan and Gordon holding a pepper grinder.
Gordon is seen in a red jumper while Matilda dons a white dress.
In the middle of the clip, however, a swift edit cuts to the pair having swapped clothes.
Gordon is seen displaying his smooth cleavage with a long v-cut on his daughter's dress, while Matilda comfortably grooves in her dad's jumper.
The hilarious video naturally saw some responses from amused fans who lapped up their pair's antics.
One follower joked in the replies on Twitter : "That’s a hell of a kitchen nightmare."
Another fan tweeted: "You two are so FUNNY."
Elsewhere, a different follower commented: "Ugh I live for wholesome content like this.
"An acutal TikTok god."
"The legend himself has an amazing sense of humor," wrote another admirer.
Finally, one humorous Twitter user noted: "That’s a lot of pepper in the dish Gordon! Gonna be spicy!!"
The funny TikTok post comes after reports of Ramsay being faced with complaints about breaking social-distancing guidelines.
A source at the Maritime and Coastguard Agency told the Daily Mail : " He does not seem to be obeying the rules regarding social distancing, exercise and staying at home."
However, it seems that Gordon has taken the advice very seriously now, according to the report.
"One of our staff spoke to him about the frequency with which he was being seen out and about, and the significant distances.
"After a period of reflection, he seemed to calm himself and took on board what was being conveyed in a most polite manner."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gordon Ramsay dons daughter's dress as he gets on TikTok hype</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gordon Ramsay has got on the TikTok hype once more, during lockdown.
While many of us are getting to the stage that we’re bored of our hourly walks to the fridge, the celebrity chef is clearly having the best time while isolating.
And he was joined by his daughter Matilda as they spent their day attempting the viral Flip The Switch challenge in the kitchen of their swanky Cornwall home.
In the video, shared on his Twitter page, the 53-year-old could be seen bopping along with a pepper grinder as Matilda stirred a saucepan.
After a few seconds of their dancing, they switched clothes in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it transition.
Gordon was left dancing in the youngster’s white day dress, while she rocked his red jumper.
Who knew the dad-of-five would look so good in a dress?
‘I think I did this right…..,’ he captioned the clip, sending fans into total meltdown in the comments.
His followers weren’t quite sure what they had just watched, with one quipping: ‘That’s a hell of a kitchen nightmare.’
‘This is basically every TikTok lmao you genius,’ an impressed follower replied.
‘Omg iconic,’ another said, while a Twitter user penned: ‘You in the dress was hilarious!’
We totally agree.
Gordon is currently isolating at his Cornwall mansion with wife Tana and their five children – Matilda, Oscar, Jack, Megan and Holly.
However, their time together has been marred by claims that angry neighbours are unhappy over the family’s move from London. 
According to reports, residents had taken to social media to tell the family they weren’t ‘wanted’ in the area – despite seeing the property as their main home.
Gordon has yet to address the claims, but heaped praise on a generous neighbour who dropped off some asparagus to the Ramsay household.
Sharing off the gift on the gram, he added: ‘Now that’s what I call love thy neighbour, see? 
‘That’s how you look after each other across these difficult times. There you go.’
We love to see it.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CASUALTY fans are outraged after BBC pulled an entire episode tonight deeming it ‘inappropriate’ during the coronavirus pandemic.
The series missed out on a show and skipped ahead to the next one leaving viewers confused and demanding it be uploaded to iPlayer.
Viewers across the country were outraged tonight as BBC bosses decided to pull an episode of Casualty and skip ahead to the next.
Fans of the show were outraged with many taking to social media to voice their annoyance.
One wrote: “Skipping an episode of Casualty. Bonkers. Idiotic decision. #Casualty”
And another ranted: “‘Watching #Casualty... feeling cheated! Let the public decide what’s appropriate or not! We paid for the episode... so let us see it.”
A third added: “Watching #Casualty... feeling cheated! Let the public decide what’s appropriate or not! We paid for the episode... so let us see it.”
Viewers were told about the decision via a voiceover before the show.
It announced: “The episode we were due to watch tonight, filmed before the spread of COVID-19, was considered inappropriate to show at the moment.
"But never fear, everything we need to know from that episode is in a catch up right at the start of the programme."
However it didn't stop some fans from being confused by the whole thing and suggesting it be put on iPlayer instead.
One wrote: “Really hope they put the missing episode of Casualty on iplayer. Especially since it has links to real affairs going on in the world today. This episode could give people a well-needed reality check!”
While a second added: “Hopefully the BBC will release it on bbc iplayer, allowing viewers to choose whether or not to watch it.”
A third reasoned: “They miss a #Casualty ep, understandable if it was going to be upsetting an inappropriate, put in on iplayer maybe?”
Fans of the show will have to wait a couple of weeks to see what happens next as the medical drama doesn’t return to our screens until 23rd May, on BBC One.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gogglebox stars have been forced to defend themselves as viewers criticise the show for 'breaking social distancing rules'.
The Channel 4 show has been continuing to air during the coronavirus pandemic but has come under fire each week for the apparent breach of the measures.
Complaints have been made to broadcasting watchdog Ofcom and fans have hit out on social media over the issue.
This forced Channel 4 into responding to the complaints on air before the most recent episode of Gogglebox on Friday night.
The announcer said: "Just in case you're worried, they are all keeping to the guidelines of social distancing."
And now the Malone family - Tom, Julie, Tom Jnr and Shaun - have had their say on the matter.
In a tweet, the Manchester family said: "Just going to put this out there so we are all up to date, I know the social distancing rules too, I love my Grandkids, I would never put them or anyone else's health in danger.
"My daughter and her children live with us,so she can go to work as a nurse x"
Earlier this week, Ian Katz, director of programmes at Channel 4, explained the secret to keeping the Bafta-award winning show on air.
He hailed Gogglebox as one of the "real miracles" of the network during the current crisis.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Did Jill Scott, 48, date Drake, 33, back in the day? That’s the question that was on many fans’ minds after the singer admitted the rapper used to be “a wiggle in my giggle” in her latest congratulatory post to him, which she wrote in the caption for two pics she posted, including one of that showed the cover of one of his new releases and a throwback that showed them smiling and posing together. “Back when Drake was the wiggle in my giggle-white Lamborghini, Maserati @champagnepapi ❤️Respect and congratulations Doc,” the caption read.
It didn’t take long for fans to start speculating about what exactly Jill meant with her cheeky message and many of them seemed to think it mean the two had previously been more than friends. “Jill put that mic work on him😩,” one follower wrote while another wrote “😍 SUGA MAMA VIBES 🙌🏽.” “I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on in that statement 🤔,” another replied. “Yo wiggle to yo giggle what?” asked a fourth and another said “Drake definitely wanted her mic skills.”
Although Jill didn’t elaborate further on what exactly she meant with her caption, it’s clear to see that she’s super thrilled for the “Hotline Bling” crooner latest music release. The mixed tape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes, came out on May 1 and features some of his unreleased songs, songs from SoundCloud, and some new tracks. His next studio album, which he has yet to name, will be released later in the summer of 2020.
We’ll be on the lookout to see if Jill or Drake post anything else that may confirm what exactly she meant. In the meantime, we’ll just enjoy Drake’s new tunes!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Keroche CEO Tabitha Karanja In Mourning After Losing Daughter Tecra Muigai In An Accident</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Keroche Breweries founder and CEO Tabitha Karanja has lost her daughter Tecra Muigai in an accident.
Tabitha is married to Joseph Karanja and together, they have four children; James Karanja (who serves as the Chairman of Keroche Breweries Limited), Anerlisa Muigai, Edward Muigai and Tecra Muigai.
Tecra is the second last born among the four, and has always maintained a low profile, unlike the eldest daughter Anerlisa, who has been in the media limelight.
Until her death she worked as the Strategy and Innovation Director at Keroche Breweries.
In a statement Keroche Breweries said that Tetra’s brilliance, passion and energy were the source of important innovations that have enriched the company’s product range including the development of new brands that were scheduled to he launched this year.
“While we mourn the loss of a remarkable young lady, we also celebrate her life and hope that it serves as an example to young people around the world to work hard to make their dreams come true and to be willing to explore and push their limits,” read the statement in part.
Tecra had also been studying in UK and Italy, and only came back in the wake of Covid-19.
The last born, Edward, is studying abroad.
Early this year, Anerlisa revealed that her sister hated being on the limelight, the reason little is known about her.
“When we walk together then she sees a lot of people, she always leaves me like somebody she doesn’t know. She just hates the spotlight and that is why I don’t post her on my page even if it’s a family photo,” revealed Anerlisa.
The family has asked for respect and privacy as burial preparations take off.
“As we begin preparations for her final send off, we ask for respect and privacy during these difficult times,” added the statement.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Quarantine isn’t stopping Kaia Gerberor Lori Harvey from keeping fit! In separate Instagram posts, the pair proved they’re able to exercise (and look chic while doing it) as they remain inside and adhere to the stay-at-home order. In a snap posted on May 1, Lori, 23, rocked a one-shouldered black crop top with matching black yoga pants! The mirror selfie, which was taken in front of a sleek staircase, also showed off her gold watch, long cream nails, and Cartier diamond pave love bracelet which retails for a cool $40,000.
The brunette beauty’s luscious locks were curled, and fell below her shoulders as she kept her makeup look minimal. “If absolute perfection was a person,” one fan commented on the model’s snap! Meanwhile, Kaia was also showing off her toned abs in a mirror selfie wearing a SetActive crop top and leggings. The photo was taken in her closet, as she donned the pretty beige activewear, and allowed her locks to fall just above her shoulders. The model also appeared to have blond highlights framing her face!
The 18-year-old took to her Instagram account earlier in the week shared a selfie featuring one of the little pooches she is fostering during the coronavirus pandemic. In the photo, Kaia snuggled up to the pup while the two laid in bed. The supermodel was completely makeup free, showing off her stunning complexion and bold eyebrows. Kaia softly placed her head near her puppy’s and gazed at the camera. “It’s our fifth nap of the day,” she captioned the post.
Kaia has been taking care of a few adorable little pups for almost a month. On April 11, Kaia and her father, Rande Gerber, 57, were spotted on their way to the Labelle Foundation in Los Angeles to pick up one of their sweet little dogs. Kaia was dressed comfortable and casual for the excursion, showing off her toned abs in a tank crop top and flared jeans with sneakers. Rande helped Kaia gently tuck the little puppy safely into their car before the father-daughter duo headed home to welcome the newest member of their family.
But the adorable little dog in her April 29 Instagram isn’t the only one Kaia’s is fostering. On March 24, Kaia shared a series of posts to her Instagram story featuring the pooches she is taking care of amid the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. She also shared an image of one of the doggos sitting in her lap for a very chill moment. Of course, Kaia also used her platform to urge her fans who had the means to open their homes to a dog who needs a home. “Now is a great time to foster a puppy in need! Reach out if your living/financial situation allows,” Kaia wrote to her fans. Clearly, Kaia is spending her time in quarantine wisely, cuddling up to her new furry friends!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ana Cheri Flaunts Pert Derriere In Distressed, Figure-Hugging Jeans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Nicole Moore
The model sizzled in her revealing ensemble.
On Friday, May 1, American model Ana Cheri shared a sizzling snap with her 12.5 million Instagram followers.
The photo shows the former Playboy Playmate standing with her shoulders back and her arms to her side in what appears to be a patio. A sizable potted plant can be seen in the blurred background.
Ana sizzled in a gray long-sleeved, backless top and a pair of distressed jeans from the online clothing retailer, Fashion Nova. The revealing ensemble accentuated the model’s incredible curves and impressive back muscles. She kept the casual look relatively simple and did not wear any accessories.
The 33-year-old styled her highlighted hair in loose curls and opted to wear a minimal amount of makeup, allowing her natural beauty to shine. She made her skin look absolutely radiant by applying highlighter to the bridge of her nose and peach blush to the apples of her cheeks. Ana also sported sculpted eyebrows, voluminous lashes, and nude lip gloss.
For the picture, the stunner struck a seductive pose by facing away from the photographer, flaunting her pert derriere. She turned her head and lowered her gaze, with her mouth slightly open.
In the post’s caption, the social media sensation provided additional advertisement for Fashion Nova by tagging the company.
The post appears to be a fan favorite as it soon racked up more than 120,000 likes. Many of Ana’s followers also flocked to the comments section to shower her with compliments. While some simply left a trail of heart and fire emoji to express their admiration for the model, others were decidedly more vocal in their praise.
“You look amazing in anything,” gushed a fan, adding a string of heart-eye emoji to the comment.
“Beautiful! That’s a nice picture,” added another admirer.
“Hmm! It’s the most beautiful woman in the world!” wrote a different devotee.
“One word that automatically comes from [my] mouth is wow! Just wow!” chimed in a fourth Instagram user.
Ana has not yet responded to the comments.
As fans are aware, this is far from the first time that the digital influencer has shown off her amazing assets on social media. In fact, a majority of her Instagram photos consist of her in risque outfits. Earlier this week, she uploaded a picture, in which she wore a strappy black bra and a pair of matching underwear. That provocative post has been liked over 300,000 times since it was shared.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Drake’s New Mixtape Might Not Debut at No. 1</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Drake's run of No. 1 debuts may end next week.
Drizzy released his surprise mixtape compilation Dark Lane Demo Tapes on Friday (May 1). The release contains leaked, previously released and new tracks featuring guest appearances from the likes of Future, Chris Brown, Playboi Carti, Young Thug and more. Usually, a Drake project would be a slam dunk to debut in the No. 1 spot on the Billboard 200 chart. Not this time. Aubrey's new project dropped the same day as country music superstar Kenny Chesney's Here and Now album and the race for the top spot is going to be very close.
According to a report from HitsDailyDouble published on Saturday (May 2), projections have both artists moving in the area of 250,000 units, with Drake expected to push 230,000 to 255,000, while Chesney's numbers are thought to be in the 220,000 to 235,000 range. This means a strong push from Chesney fans could lead to him taking the top spot on the Billboard 200 when the top 10 is announced next week. That would stop Drake's streak for No. 1 debuts at nine. Currently, every solo project Drizzy has released post 2009's So Far Gone has peaked at No. 1 (including his Future collab project What a Time to Be Alive).
With touring on hold due to the coronavius, Drake is currently working on a new album, which he recently revealed will be coming out this summer. In February, he unveiled some details on the forthcoming project.
"Last album, I went high volume. It did two sides, 20-something songs, which is a lot of songs. This album, I'll probably make it a more realistic offering, something more concise," Drake revealed. "Anywhere, whatever you want, it can be 10, 11, 16. I also do a lot of different types of music so it's tough to make it like a seven-song album or something like that. Yea, I'm having a lot of fun right now making music."
Drake recently confirmed he will collab with Lil Wayne for the first time in a while.
See the Best Hip-Hop Projects From 2010
A decade ago, Big Boi set out on his own to drop a true solo project, as he and André 3000 took a hiatus on recording together as OutKast. Sir Lucious Left Foot...The Son of Chico Dusty, which dropped on July 5, 2010. is an exploration of various sounds, including booming bass, rattling hi-hats and even a choir, with Big Boi's long-proven talent and skill anchoring it all. Songs like the thumping "Shutterbugg" and "Shine Blockas" showcased that Big Boi certainly had solid bars, whether he was a part of a duo or going solo. A win for Daddy Fat Sax.
Devin The Dude is a Houston legend, thanks to his appearances on some of the biggest song's in the city's history and his own solo work. While Gotta Be Me dropped later on his career (this was his seventh album when it arrived on Nov. 2, 2010), the LP had the same charm that made Devin who he is: a talented, weed-smoking everyman who knows how to put life into perspective. "Come & Go" is a smooth retelling of the sexually-charged life Devin was living while "When Will I Win?" is just a man facing the monotony and setbacks of life. Always true to himself, the album couldn't have been more aptly titled.
Diddy has always been good at reinventing himself; it's how he's managed to stay relevant for nearly 30 years. Diddy Dirty Money, his collab with Bad Boy R&B group Dirty Money, was his most ambitious musical voyage yet. It all worked out though, as the rap, soul and dance mesh of an album, Last Train to Paris, produced plenty of hits ("Coming Home" featuring Skylar Grey) and club bangers ("Ass On the Floor" with Swizz Beatz) for every music-loving listener. Diddy always saw himself as being able to do it all, and this album, which dropped on Dec. 14, 2010, and debuted at No. 7 on the Billboard 200 chart, proved that he just might be onto something.
In 2010, Drake was one of the biggest new names in hip-hop, thanks to the nearly overnight success of his mixtape, So Far Gone, released a year earlier in 2009. His debut album, Thank Me Later, arriving on June 15, 2010, had an incredible level of anticipation around it, and its' release answered a lot of questions: could Drizzy live up to the hype being one of them. That he did. Drake could fit in alongside rap legends, like he did with Jay-Z on "Light Up" and continue to craft hit singles like "Miss Me" featuring Lil Wayne, all while still being vulnerable and going the R&B singing route when he wanted to on "Cece's Interlude." This album was the beginning of Drake's dominance and a showing of what he and producer 40 could do as a team; Thank Me Later's No. 1 debut on the Billboard 200 albums chart was a sign of things to come.
On March 30, 2010, hip-hop legend E-40 pulled off a wild feat; he dropped two albums on the same day, adding to an already dense discography. Revenue Retrievin' was released in a Day Shift and a Night Shift version, both with totally different tracks. The Bay Area legend eventually released them together as a deluxe edition of an album. The track "Bitch," off Day Shift, was one of the bigger songs, also getting a remix featuring 50 Cent. These two albums illustrated that E-40 could think outside of the box, and still make good music this deep into his career.
Eminem's seventh studio album Recovery dropped at an interesting point of his career. His image was changing from the wild, young rapper from Detroit to the older, more mature artist, who was getting a grasp on his demons. The album, which dropped on June 18, 2010, was packed with hits: "Not Afraid," "Love the Way You Lie" with Rihanna and "No Love" featuring Lil Wayne all did extremely well, with "Not Afraid" being certified diamond. Em sounded refreshed, proving he truly had recovered from the years of inner turmoil. Recovery debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.
Fat Joe is a heralded MC from the Bronx, who built his reputation from spitting alongside his close friend, the late Big Pun. Joe enjoyed some commercial success in his past, but for The Darkside, Vol. 1, he wanted to pivot back to the lyricism. He pulled it off successfully on July 27, 2010, as the album showed he was still sharp, and open to rhyming with younger acts, like Jeezy on "(HaHa) Slow Down" or hip-hop mainstays like Clipse and Cam'ron on "Kilo." All in all, Joe did what he set out to do: show that he could turn back to Joey Crack in a flash.
As any hip-hop fan knows, Kanye West has had a crazy career, both in the booth and outside of it. Living in the aftermath of his outburst as Taylor Swift tried to receive her 2009 MTV Video Music Award, a year later on Nov. 22, 2010, Kanye dropped My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a complex, sonically stunning album with star-studded collaborators. Kanye famously holed himself up in Hawaii for this project, and flew out every big name in music, from Drake and Nicki Minaj to Elton John and Beyoncé. The result was Kanye flying through a variety of different sounds, without leaving his soul-sample roots behind. This album truly shinen a light on all sides of Kanye, be it as a remorseful significant other on "Runaway" with Pusha-T, a man fully embracing his talent and influence on "Power" or an MC going at it with other skilled rappers on "So Appalled" featuring Swizz Beatz, Jay-Z, Pusha-T, Cyhi the Prynce and RZA. This is considered by many to be ’Ye's best album, and one listen makes it clear why.
Kid Cudi has always operated in a unique space in hip-hop, incorporating plenty of singing and emotionally dark subject matter while also exuding a cool personality. Man on the Moon II: The Legend of Mr. Rager, which dropped on Nov. 9, 2010, expands on what Cudi was already building, but now with a more closer look into his life. This album features some of the songs that would be key to Cudi's career, like "Mr. Rager" and "Marijuana," for both their sing-a-long factor and embodiment of Cudi's ethos. The album debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 chart and sold 169,000 copies in its first week, and the Cudi train continued to roll on.
Lil B is both one of the strangest and most captivating artists in hip-hop. A lot of the things he did on the music front could seem a bit odd, whether it's naming songs after famous people, the cooking dance he created or refusing to change his Vans until he got rich. But there is a real appeal there. Red Flame, one of The BasedGod's many mixtapes, really stands out from 2010. A song like "I Killed Hip Hop," with Cormega speaking at the end to boot, shows he's in on the joke. "I'm Bill Clinton" and "I'm Miley Cyrus" are also popular songs on this tape amongst his fans. Lil B isn't for everyone, but Red Flame gives a clear view of why someone would be into his music and persona.
Lil Wayne was dealing with legal troubles in 2010, doing a bid at Rikers Island jail in New York to serve a one-year sentence for possessing a loaded gun on tour bus, but his name was still ringing off. I Am Not a Human Being was released on Sept. 27, 2010, while Weezy was still incarcerated. The album was a place for Wayne to have fun and feature his YM signees all over it. The lead single was the radio success "Right Above It" featuring Drake while Nicki Minaj appears on "What's Wrong With Them." The title track has Wayne rapping over a rock-heavy beat, and the already beloved song "I'm Single" also appears here. I Am Not a Human Being isn't one of Wayne's most vital releases, but he still showcased the talent that earned him in the discussion of best rapper alive. The No. 2 Billboard 200 chart debut proved that the people still loved Weezy whether behind bars or free.
Nas has always fashioned himself as a worldly artist, and Damian Marley makes music based on the reality of life in Jamaica, and touches on the plight of Africa. So the two joining together as friends to team up for the ambitious album, Distant Relatives was a welcomed surprise. Musically, this is a combo of dancehall and hip-hop, two styles that are actually married to each other in origin. Nas sounds comfortable in this world, and Damian is crisp, with the both of them shedding light on the beauty and glory that lies in Africa and the diaspora. "Tribes At War" featuring K'Naan is a metaphor about how the diaspora should unite, and "Count Your Blessings" is thoughtful and uplifting, Love and a common goal can unite us all.
Back in 2010, Nicki Minaj had tons of momentum, from building her name on the mixtape circuit and dropping feature verses like on DJ Khaled's "All I Do Is Win (Remix)." When her debut album, Pink Friday, dropped on Nov. 22, 2010, it was an immediate success, selling 375,000 copies and debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart. Multiple hit singles followed, including the anthemic "Moment 4 Life" featuring Drake, the pop-leaning "Super Bass" and the ballad "Right Thru Me," plus more. Besides the commercial success, Nicki could really rhyme, and this album exposed that to the world.
There is no rapper quite like Plies. Mixing his brazen, comedic persona with a penchant for constructing catchy songs, Plies had a strong run in the mid-to-late 2000s. Goon Affiliated is Plies' fourth studio album, a showcase that he still knew how to have fun, whether it's the ridiculous and lewd "Becky" or the audio flex-fest known as "Rob Myself." Plies never strayed too far away from his strengths, and he was appreciated for it. If you had a wild night planned in the late 2000s, you were playing some of these Plies songs as the soundtrack.
A few years prior to dropping Teflon Don, Rick Ross had an ongoing beef with 50 Cent dating back to 2008, plus there was questions about his past in law enforcement. Amongst the noise, he focused on his craft and came out with this gem of an album on July 20, 2010. Teflon Don is arguably his best album. Ross' mafioso persona meets with his now polished command of words, leading to him shining on nearly every song. Ross has a show-stopping verse on "Maybach Music III" alongside Jadakiss, T.I. and Erykah Badu, and upped his game to meet Jay-Z on "Free Mason." When you commit to the music, you can do anything.
There will always be rap fans who want to hear the genre as it "used to be," with more traditional rappers making music about the streets and their experiences in it. Roc Marciano fills that lane, but without sounding dated and bringing his own style to it. With a trademark voice, and a flow that sounds like he's talking his way through a great story, Roc received a lot of buzz on the underground circuit quickly. His 2010 debut album, Marcberg, features him providing stellar bars, plus he produced every beat. "Snow" is a popular track from this album and later got a remix with the late Brooklyn rapper Sean Price. "Ridin' Around" is a mix of a fire loop along with Roc going crazy and giving out game. Marcberg proves he was really talented back then, and still is now.
Soulja Boy is the first real artist to kick off the YouTube/MySpace era of music, simply because of how relentless he was and knowing his audience. He was also a teenager having fun, which seeped through his music. As he got older, his style changed a bit. The DeAndre Way is SB growing up and no longer focusing on songs that come with built-in dances. Here, it's clear he centered his energy on good rapping. Out of that came "Pretty Boy Swag," one of the bigger songs in his career, all about loving yourself and admiring the person in the mirror. "30 Thousand 100 Million" with Lil B and Arab also deserves a nod from this era of Soulja Boy.
The Roots are an immensely talented and respected hip-hop band, and have held that title for years. How I Got Over is an album that showcases The Roots maintaining their reputation, and continuing to push the envelope. The main single from the project is "God 2.0," a remake of one of their previous songs, where lead rapper Black Thought questions how God works and asks for guidance. The inspirational single "The Fire" became one of the band's biggest songs, having over 25 million streams to this day. The LP earned the group a No. 6 spot on the Billboard 200 chart.
T.I. has had a long, storied career while also having to wade through some tumultuous times. Months after being released from prison after pleading guilty to three charges of illegal weapons possession, T.I. and his wife, Tiny, caught drug charges right before his No Mercy was set to release. The LP dropped on Dec. 7, 2010, while T.I. was behind bars for that probation violation. This album introduced a more calmer Tip, aiming to be more uplifting than aggressive and street-focused like on albums prior "Get Back Up" featuring Chris Brown is a motivational tune and "Poppin' Bottles" features a very early on Drake, just entering into rap stardom. The album, which came in at No. 4 on the Billboard 200 chart, finds Tip reflecting on lessons he's learned and soul-searching.
Trap rap was really starting to surge in 2010, and Atlanta's own Waka Flocka Flame was one of the more popular names in the market. In some regions, the sub-genre wasn't respected, but Flocka brushed all that aside and dropped Flockaveli, a solid debut album that embodied trap rap. Whether it's his hit single "No Hands" with Wale and Roscoe Dash or his already established mixtape song "O Let's Do It," Waka had truly arrived with respect attached to his name. The project is also well-sequenced, and maintains Waka's wild, energy-packed style, something that can be watered down by a major label release.
Yelawolf has a unique voice in hip-hop, telling the story of the struggle in Tennessee, the parts away from the cities. In addition to his out-of-the-ordinary story, he can really spit, and wasn't afraid to rhyme alongside legends like Raekwon. Trunk Muzik 0-60 is his major label re-release of his previous tape, Trunk Muzik. The new effort keeps half of those songs and adds six new ones. One of the new tracks is "Daddy's Lambo," his most popular track at the time, finds him juxtaposing his lifestyle with that of rich people. He even goes into the world of a spiraling relationship on "Love Is Not Enough," which samples Devin The Dude's classic song "Anythang."
Lloyd Banks has had a successful career as the second in command in G-Unit, led by 50 Cent. Banks is always considered the skilled lyricist of the group, delivering punchline after punchline. His 2010 album, H.F.M. 2 (Hunger For More 2), isn't as heralded as the prequel, but proves that Banks certainly has some polish to him. "Start It Up" featuring Fabolous, Kanye West, Ryan Leslie and Swizz Beatz is a fun radio record, and "Beamer, Benz, or Bentley" with Juelz Santana was the sought-after peace pipe on wax between G-Unit and Dipset. "I Don't Deserve You" featuring Jeremih also became a timeless thug love song that wasn't corny.
Wu-Tang is forever. Raekwon, Method Man and Ghostface Killah made that sentiment ring loud and clear when they linked up to drop the Wu-Massacre album together on March 30, 2010. There were some rumors that the trio was creating a Wu off-shoot, but that was hardly the case; they were just three longtime partners in rhyme doing a service to the culture with this great LP. Wu-Massacre delivers, with all three rappers sounding fresh and engaged with stellar bars. "Mef vs Chef 2" is still incredible today, and Ghostface shines on the Michael Jackson-sampling "Our Dreams," wishfully rhyming about his woman. Steel sharpens steel, and there's not too many groups with as many lyrical swordsmen as Wu-Tang Clan.
Little Brother were a rare asset to the underground hip-hop scene during the mid-to-early aughts. The duo, consisting of Big Pooh and Phonte (and included producer 9th Wonder until 2007), were seen as skilled MCs who were also regular guys dealing with normal troubles. Their sound resonated for a good run, but there was some turmoil within the group. When 9th Wonder left in 2007, Pooh suggested in a 2008 interview that there would never be another Little Brother album again. That changed when Leftback arrived on April 10, 2010. The album didn't beat around the bush, and from the first track "Curtain Call," it was obvious the duo was really on the way to ending things. While not as strong as their previous work, there are quality songs that resonate, like "So Cold" featuring Chaundon and "What We Are" featuring Quiana. While they did part ways after, LB ended up reuniting as a duo in 2019 with their May the Lord Watch album.
As a 2010 XXL Freshman, this magazine believed in Freddie Gibbs early on, and it's easy to see why. A talented lyricist from Gary, Ind., Gibbs had a style all his own with the melody of Midwestern rap and the vivid, street lyrics of rap's past. Str8 Killa is one of his early EPs, released during the blog rap era on Aug. 3, 2010. Freddie separated himself from a lot of his rap peers with his clear-eyed views, taking America and the music industry to task on "National Anthem (Fuck The World)," and showcasing his ability to carry a tune, like on the weed song "Personal OG." Gibbs has certainly evolved from the sound he has here, and grew into one of rap's most respected MCs over time.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It looks like it will be a big week for Drake on this week’s Official Singles Chart: he’s set to land three spots in the Top 10 following the release of his Dark Lane Demo Tapes album.
Current single Toosie Slide jumps from 4 to 2, Chicago Freestyle ft. Giveon is new at 7, and Not You Too ft. Chris Brown opens at 9. View Drake's full Official Chart history so far here.
Meanwhile, BBC Radio 1’s Stay Home Live Lounge Allstars narrowly hold the lead at Number 1 with Times Like These, less than 200 chart sales ahead of Toosie Slide.
A new remix of Doja Cat’s Say So featuring Nicki Minaj could send the track to a new peak this week, up seven places to Number 3. Say So has already proven a runaway hit this year, already spending nine weeks inside the Top 10.
Similarly, a new version of Megan Thee Stallion’s Savage featuring Beyoncé is sending the song up the chart, currently up 18 places to Number 4.
AJ Tracey could be securing his fourth Top 10 with new single Dinner Guest ft. Mostack, currently at Number 10.
Finally, Amanda Holden is set to make her Official Chart debut this week with her rendition of classic hit Over The Rainbow, currently placed at Number 14. The TV star and Britain’s Got Talent judge is releasing the song to raise money for the NHS. The final Official Chart Top 40 will be unveiled on BBC Radio 1’s Official Chart with Scott Mills this Friday from 4pm, with the full Official Singles Chart Top 100 published on OfficialCharts.com from 5.45pm.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Terrie McEvoy has been enjoying a well-deserved break over the Bank Holiday weekend.
Proving you can turn a sunny weekend in Ireland into the perfect Staycation, the influencer, who recently returned to nursing, popped to a secluded beach right by her house.
Of course everyone in Ireland has been asked to still stay within 2km from their homes – until Tuesday when the distance will change to 5km.
Taking to Instagram the Bahama Body Tan creator stunned in a black swimsuit, oversized beige cardigan and a large hat.
Alongside the post Terrie encouraged others to stay within their restricted areas until the guidelines change.
“Few moments on a secluded beach close to our home this morning was heaven ☀️💦,” she wrote.
“Short but sweet 👫🏻🐶😊 How lucky is Ireland with this beautiful weather😭🙌🏼 Enjoy every minute safely💕 #Ireland #summerpending
“(I know the weather is beautiful so if you are heading outside for a few minutes today for some fresh air, please please maintain social distancing and adhere to guidelines ☘️🙌🏼❤️).”
Terrie has been very vocal about social distancing guidelines since she returned to nursing, after the HSE called for nurses to return to the frontline.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sara Underwood Eats Ice Cream, Shows Off Curves In White & Red Bikini On Instagram</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Elise Nelson
Sara Underwood shared a vacation throwback photo with her fans on Saturday afternoon. In a new photo on her feed, the blond babe rocked a white and red bikini that left little to the imagination as she enjoyed an ice cream cone. In the caption, she asked fans when they think people can start vacationing again.
The photo showed Sara standing next to a white and blue ice cream stand on wheels in the Bahamas, as the post’s geotag indicated. Behind her, a blue and white striped building could be seen, as well as some bushes. She stood in the sand and allowed the sunlight to wash over her tan skin. Sara looked ready for a day in paradise in her swimwear, which did nothing but favors for her killer body.
Sara’s look included an off-the-shoulder, bandeau-style bikini top in white. The short sleeves rested on her biceps. The center of the top featured a sweetheart neckline, so the low cut exposed her ample cleavage.
Sara’s flat, toned tummy was on full display between the top and red and white striped bikini bottoms. The bottoms were cut in a U-shape, so the front remained low on Sara’s waist and showed off her abs. Meanwhile, the sides came up high above her hips and drew attention to her hourglass figure. Her long, lean legs were exposed via the high cuts, as well.
Sara accessorized her outfit with a straw fedora. She appeared to be rocking a subtle makeup look, including contoured cheekbones, bright highlighter, and a light pink lipstick. Her long, blond hair was styled in a messy bun beneath the hat, with a few strands left out to frame her face.
Sara leaned against the ice cream cart as she pointed her toes, which elongated her pins. She leaned to one side in a way that further accentuated her figure. Sara held the ice cream cone up beside her head and flashed a smirk at the camera.
The post garnered more than 20,000 likes and nearly 200 comments in under an hour, proving to be a hit with her fans. Many of the model’s followers left praise for her flawless physique in the comments section.
“Wow a very beautiful woman,” one fan said.
“You looking stunning Sara,” another user added.
Sara always knows how to drive her fans wild. In a post earlier this week, she drank a bottle of whiskey while she rocked a blue mini dress, which her followers loved.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3 (UPI) -- A 90-second teaser for the new TV drama Paradise City features appearances by the late Cameron Boyce and former Sons of Anarchy stars Ryan Hurst and Drea De Matteo and Mark Boone Junior.
Boyce -- who is best known for his work in the Descendants and Grown-Up movies --died last year after an epileptic seizure. He was 20.
Deadline.com said the eight-episode series Paradise City is his final screen project.
Friday's previewhas gotten nearly 3 million views since it debuted on YouTube.
"The lives of a rock star with ties to the occult and a young rookie kid who idolizes him collide through their broken homes built by the music business," a synopsis said.
Co-starring Andy Black, Bella Thorne, Fairuza Balk, BooBoo Stewart and Olivia Culpo, the show is expected to premiere this year, but the exact release date and network have not been announced yet.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The first teaser for Cameron Boyce's final onscreen project, Paradise City, is officially here. The clip, which dropped on May 1, features the late actor as Simon, an aspiring rock star who finds himself enwrapped in the dark side of Hollywood. "Do you think that devil worship is real in Hollywood?" Boyce says in one scene. "Like the whole black magic, and all that stuff." His costar replies, "Oh, I definitely think there's good and evil spirits, and black magic is real."
According to Paradise City's Instagram account, a portion of the program's profits will be donated to The Cameron Boyce Foundation. The organization launched this past July, shortly after the actor died from an epileptic seizure at the age of 20. "The series was filmed just months before his tragic passing," the show wrote. "He gave us an incredible performance as a young musician, band leader and aspiring DIY executive in the music business. Cameron was a truly one of a kind spectacular talent. ❤️💙💜 Every scene he was written in was shot and completed in the first season."
The show, which is scheduled for a 2020 release, also stars Boyce's Descendants castmate Booboo Stewart, as well as Andy Biersack, Olivia Culpo, Fairuza Balk, Bella Thorne, Drea de Matteo, Mark Boone, Rhys Coiro, and Ryan Hurst. It's unclear which platform or network will house the series, but People reports that it's being shopped around by CAA.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Debby Ryan is being a good sport after social media started making fun of her different facial expressions.
Over the week, TikTok users have been mimicking her.
Ryan then responded on Twitter, poking fun of herself.
“I was serious about my craft from a young age and studied technique alongside Roxanne from A Goofy Movie,” she captioned her post.
Meanwhile, Ariana Grande has been less impressed with the “ponytail TikTok girls” doing “degrading” impression of her.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Love Island star launches soft porn career as she flogs X-rated content for £7 a month</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Love Island star has launched a soft porn career by flogging topless selfies on her OnlyFans profile.
Edyn 'Mac' Mackney, who starred in the first season of Love Island Australia in 2018, took to Instagram to reveal she has created an account on the X-rated app.
OnlyFans lets its users sell content to their followers which ranges from sexy pictures of themselves in their underwear to hardcore pornography.
Edyn, 24, is charging her fans $14.95 (£7.68) a month to subscribe to view her raunchy content.
On Friday she posted a topless photo of herself on Instagram to plug her account.
In the photo she and a friend covered their bare nipples with nothing but gang signs.
She captioned the post: "Our mood when people are offended by boobs.
"Link in bio if nipples don't offend you."
Since starting her account Edyn has been posting a string of saucy pictures.
She has shared endless bikini snaps and a few artfully posed nude shots where she keeps her body covered with her hands.
Edyn drew controversy for posting a picture of her bare bum a supermarket but defended herself saying the shop was empty at the time.
She made her name on Love Island Australia but previously hit headlines after being declared to be "too large" to be a model at a size six.
Edyn was dumped from the villa on day 38.
The series was won by Grant Crapp and Tayla Damir.

    <h5 class="mb-1">David Walliams brands Jamie Redknapp's gorgeous mum Sandra, 74, a 'Hot Mama'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TV funnyman David Walliams has branded Jamie Redknapp's mum a 'hot mama'.
The Britain's Got Talent Judge, 48, was left mighty impressed when footballer Jamie, 46, took to social media to share a tribute to his 74-year-old mother on her birthday.
Taking to Instagram, Jamie shared images of his toned mum Sandra posing in swimwear and showing off her classic good looks with her high cheekbones.
Clearly ageing like a fine wine, svelte Sandra looks incredible in the photos.
Jamie captioned the post: "Happy birthday to this incredible lady. We adore you mum. Thanks for your wisdom, love and care."
The former husband of Louise Redknapp, with whom he shares two sons, also spoke about being separated from his mother during the lockdown procedures enforced by the government as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
"You have been a rock throughout my life, given me support that I hope I can give my kids throughout their lives too. I miss you and I can’t wait to see you.
"No doubt you will be waiting on dad hand and foot today!
"But make sure he looks after you. See you soon when this is over and love you always. Your boy Jamie."
Many of Jamie's followers were loving the pics, but none more so than Mr Little Britain himself, David Walliams.
David commented on the post: "Hot Mama."
Jamie wasn't the only one who was sharing a tribute to Sandra, as it was also his father and her husband, football legend Harry Redknapp.
"Happy birthday Sandra I love you more now than the day I met you if that’s possible," wrote Harry on his Instagram account.
The couple first met in 1963 on the dancefloor of an East London pub when Sandra was 17.
Harry noted when appearing on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!: "We were only just 17 when we started going out, and we’ve never been apart since. I love her like mad – she’s my life."
He later went on to win the 2018 series of the show and was crowned King of the Jungle.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Disney to donate $1 million from sales of its themed face masks to charity</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
Disney is selling non-medical face masks in the US featuring characters from across its multiverse, including Pixar, Marvel, and Star Wars, the company announced.
Disney will donate one million masks to underserved communities via humanitarian aid organization MedShare, and all profits from the mask sales in the US through September 30th, up to $1 million, also will go to MedShare.
The masks, which include Anna and Elsa from Frozen; Woody and Buzz Lightyear from Toy Story; The Avengers; R2D2 and Baby Yoda (who Disney refers to as “the Child” in its release), are designed for the CDC’s recommendation that people wear cloth face coverings when out in public to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Disney said.
Cloth masks are not intended for use by medical professionals treating COVID-19 patients.
“We realize this is a challenging time for families and wearing any type of mask can be daunting,” Edward Park, senior vice president of Disney store and shopDisney said in a statement. “Our hope is that Disney’s cloth face masks featuring some of our most beloved characters will provide comfort to the families, fans and communities that are so important to us.”
The masks come in packs of four for $19.99 and are available for pre-order now in Disney’s online store, and come in various sizes, including children’s sizes. According to the shopDisney site, the company expects the masks to be available by July 15th.
“Disney’s donations will make a tremendous impact in the communities we serve,” Charles Redding, CEO and president of MedShare said in a statement.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the alternate history presented on Netflix's Hollywood, a few versions of real Golden Age stars show up, including Anna May Wong (played by Michelle Krusiec). Wong, born Wong Liu Tsong, was a glamorous screen queen and became widely acknowledged as the first Chinese-American actor to achieve real movie stardom.
In real life, her career saw her become a fashion icon but also get pigeonholed into stereotypical roles. She did, however, break a lot of new ground in the movie business, even starring on the first Asian-led American TV series in the 1950s. She might not be as much of a household name as some of her contemporaries, but she's every bit the leading lady who deserves to be remembered.
Ahead, we've rounded up some of her most glamorous and memorable pictures from her years on screen — keep reading to see how the real Anna May Wong compares to her fictional version!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ryan Murphy’s new Netflix show tries to fix Hollywood’s history</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Golden Age film actress Anna May Wong deserves better than what she gets from Netflix’s new Ryan Murphy series, Hollywood. The Chinese-American actress was a significant onscreen presence in an era where actors of color were rare. She appeared in many early pre-Hays Code crime and mystery films, like 1931’s Daughter of the Dragon and 1937’s Daughter of Shanghai, earning particular praise for her role in 1932’s Shanghai Express, opposite Marlene Dietrich. Decades before conversations about diversity in entertainment became the norm, Wong was the first Asian-American to star in a television show, as the titular character in 1951’s The Gallery of Madame Liu-Tsong.
The second episode of Murphy’s new alt-history period piece introduces aspiring film director Raymond Ainsley (Darren Criss) as he’s visiting Wong (Michelle Krusiec) at her home. She wasn’t offered many jobs during World War II, and she still resents being replaced by a white actress in yellowface for an Oscar-winning role in an adaptation of Pearl S. Buck’s The Good Earth.
Sitting with her, Ainsley confides that he’s also Asian-American. Though his mother is Filipino (like Criss’ actual mother), he’s able to pass as white in Hollywood. He wants to use his privilege to get a foot in the door at the fictional Ace Studios, and make a movie starring Wong that he’s sure will rehabilitate her career.
An alternate history where Ainsley makes Wong a star, as they both navigate America’s racism through an Asian-American lens, would be fascinating, a story well worth telling. The problem is, as with so many Ryan Murphy projects, this strong idea is just one thread in an overcrowded story. By the time Hollywood gets to the Wong subplot, it’s Hollywood’s third major interesting idea. And though the miniseriesonly has seven hourlong episodes to work with, it isn’t the last great idea, either.
Hollywood’s pilot introduces Jack Castello (newcomer David Corenswet), an aspiring actor who gets a job at a gas station that turns out to be a front for a high-end prostitution ring servicing the Hollywood elite. It’s run by Ernie West (Dylan McDermott), a silver fox ex-actor with a troubling hacking cough. Jack’s most loyal client is Avis Amberg (a stunning Patti LuPone), the wife of Ace Studios head Ace Amberg (Rob Reiner). Also featured: Archie (Jeremy Pope) a Black aspiring screenwriter who’s sent Ace Studios a blind script submission about Peg Entwistle — a biopic about the young actress who died by suicide after jumping off the H of the Hollywood(land) sign after being cut from a film. Archie is one of Ernie’s escorts, but unlike Jack, Archie prefers male clients — which leads him to a serious relationship with a young actor named Roy Scherer, soon to be known as Rock Hudson.
And we haven’t even gotten to the fact that Archie’s PegEntwistle flick eventually morphs into a very different fim— a “race picture” now starring Ainsley’s beau, Camille Washington (Laura Harrier, who proved her ample talents in BlackKklansman), who pushes for the idea. As with the introduction of Anna May Wong, this story about a Black studio contract player finally getting her big Lena Horne-esque break would have made for an interesting seven episodes. But Hollywood reveals nothing about Camille, except that she’s talented and beautiful. She has no backstory or personal history, aside from being Ainsley’s girlfriend. It’s strange, given the time, that colorism is never brought up — Harrier is darker-skinned than Horne, and that would have been a definite barrier to film entry in the 1940s. So would her open relationship with a man perceived to be white. The latter is mentioned a few times in passing fashion, but the series doesn’t contend with any of this. Race is at Hollywood’s forefront, but it isn’t explored with any particular care or awareness.
Pose collaborator Janet Mock wrote two episodes of Hollywood, and her scripts’ tonal shift toward more realistic portrayals of racism is noticeable, while still adding to the show’s unevenness. Murphy and Ian Brennan wrote the rest of the show, and the single thing uniting all the threads they’re desperately weaving together is their clear desire to fix Hollywood, and write the wrongs suffered by everyone in the business who wasn’t a straight white man. In the pilot, Jack even states the show’s thesis outright: “Movies don’t just show us the way the world is, they show us how the world could be.” That’s all well and good, but fixing the problems of Hollywood’s Golden Age unfortunately requires the same things fixing Hollywood would require today; namely, getting rid of racism, sexism, and homophobia.
No worries, though — Murphy and Brennan are on it. In Hollywood, the only thing marginalised people need is the backing of a few plucky white folks willing to validate their voices and ideas, as well as their race and sexuality. But when the white characters solve absolutely every problem presented, the agency of the non-white characters disappears. They’re, essentially reduced to pawns moved around the board by more powerful people. Murphy is clearly well-meaning but he’s flirted with both tokenism and the white savior trope before. His hit high-school musical Glee never seemed to know what to do with its talented Black and Asian performers, like Amber P. Riley, Harry Schum Jr., and Jenna Ushkowitz.. Riley’s character Mercedes, for instance, had no backstory, no homelife, and no notable characteristics, aside from the powerhouse voice typically associated with a Black church sound.
Watching Lupone swan sublimely through scene after scene is wonderful, but it’s tempered by the way her character spends so much of her time in the back half of this miniseries being praised and thanked by the people of color under her. Avis and her Ace Studios coworkers, Dick Samuels (Joe Mantello) and Ellen Kinkaid (Holland Taylor), are the white-savior trope personified, but Murphy, Brennan, and their characters don’t seem to grasp this. And with so many of the storylines teasing a more nuanced look at discrimination in entertainment, the tone-deafness becomes one of Hollywood’s major failings.
And strangely, in spite of the show’s focus on discrimination, anti-Semitism is never mentioned — even though Avis, Ace, and their daughter Claire ( Samara Weaving) are revealed as Jewish in a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it fashion late in the season, and even though the series takes place literally months after the end of World War II and the Holocaust. Avis and Claire are depicted as struggling purely because they’re women. (And in Claire’s case, because she’s a studio head’s daughter, poor thing.) Given the Ku Klux Klan’s place in Hollywood’s story, even the faintest mention of the group’s notoriousanti-Semetism could have given both characters more depth.
No one wants to watch a show about marginalised people who exist solely to be mired in their social struggles. The suffering-minority trope wasn’t fresh even when it showed up in the melodramas of Hollywood’s era, like in both versions of Imitation of Life. But it’s frustrating to see bigotry casually dismissed as an easy barrier to overcome. Hollywood characters come out as gay with relative ease. Studio execs’ minds are easily changed when they worry putting Camille in a lead role, and the one holdout is conveniently persuaded by Eleanor Roosevelt herself. The white executives even invent the concept of the wide release for the film’s benefit, prompting more thanks.
And when a spark of intrigue is finally introduced and it seems as though the lead players won’t get what they want with ease, the cliffhanger of one episode is miraculously erased within the first few minutes of the next. You’ll never again see Ku Klux Klan cross-burnings receive such a tepid response, or be as quickly forgotten, as they are in Hollywood.
There are ways to acknowledge the realities of bigotry being without making hardships the only things going on in the lives of marginalized characters. Murphy and his team do this incredibly well on Pose, which is perhaps why Mock’s episodes of Hollywood feel slightly more grounded in reality than the rest of the series. On Pose, Mock has pointed out that because the show’s leads are trans women, they don’t have to “defend their identities” or go above and beyond to teach cisgender people a lesson. “They are just trans women who live their lives in gritty, dirty, messy-ass 1980s New York City.” This means that while Pose certainly masterfully deals with topics like the AIDS crisis, hardship doesn’t define the characters’ entire existence. With all Hollywood’s pointed references to real-world events (the Good Earth controversy, Peg Entwistle, Vivian Leigh’s bipolar episodes, the success of films like The Wizard of Oz, and more), Murphy and company clearly aren’t making a pure movieland fantasy.
If they were, Hollywood’s mishmash of storylines and characters might be more palatable. It might be more plausible that an old white man in 1946 took it upon himself to save a “race film” from being destroyed, and aid it into a wide theatrical release. Uneven moments in the script could be overlooked, such as when Camille has to fight her way into her assigned front row seat at the Oscars ceremony (taking advice from Hattie McDaniel, played perfectly via a surprise cameo), even though Archie and Rock Hudson, who are booed as they walk the red carpet hand in hand, had no problems reaching their seats.
But it’s unclear whose story this latest Netflix offering is trying to tell, and it suffers from Murphy and company stuffing too many ideas into too little space. That problem has plagued Murphy for much of his career. His projects trend toward greatness when his involvement is minimal, and the diverse creators in the room are allowed to focushis many ideas. Perhaps the greatest example is his strong, specific miniseries, The People v. OJ Simpson,which he executive-produced without writing an episode. His hands are all over Hollywood — his writing credit is on every episode — and he brought all his usual flaws along with him.

    <h5 class="mb-1">WATCH: RAF Cosford voluntary band's lockdown Bare Necessities</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">RAF Cosford's voluntary band may be miles apart, but the group have come together to record a special song to encourage people to stay safe during the coronavirus outbreak.
Members of the band performed a special rendition of the Bare Necessities to remind everyone to stay home during the lockdown and stay safe.
Acting Bandmaster, Sergeant James Buckley, said they wanted to spread positivity with an important message, and while the band could not get together in real life, they all recorded their parts separately on mobile phones.
James, who lives in St. Georges in Telford, said: "We sent out the music to everyone and we had already rehearsed the piece quite a while ago before everything happened.
"Then everyone listened to the clip on headphones and played along to it to keep in time. Everyone recorded it on their mobile phones and sent it back to myself and one of the corporals who worked to put it all together, editing the video and sound. And the finished product is what you see.
"It is a really popular tune with adults and children so we just tweaked the title to say only leave your house for the 'bare necessities'. The restrictions are still in force but people are starting to slip a bit.
"I personally do not want lockdown relaxed. My wife had coronavirus, so I know first hand how hard it is. She has recovered now but it was a scary time."
James said the best way to send a message sometimes is with music and the band missed playing together – it has been seven weeks since their last rehearsal.
"Out of 50 of our members, five of them are actually serving. We are made up of service men and women, veterans and civilians from the local area.
"It is our great love of wanting to make music that brings us together. There is no charge, and if people do not have their own instruments, we can provide them.
"We have people playing from 18 to 84 and from doctors to schoolteachers, anyone can get involved."

    <h5 class="mb-1">WATCH: RAF Cosford voluntary band's lockdown Bare Necessities</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Members of the band performed a special rendition of the Bare Necessities to remind everyone to stay home during the lockdown and stay safe.
Acting Bandmaster, Sergeant James Buckley, said they wanted to spread positivity with an important message, and while the band could not get together in real life, they all recorded their parts separately on mobile phones.
James, who lives in St. Georges in Telford, said: "We sent out the music to everyone and we had already rehearsed the piece quite a while ago before everything happened.
"Then everyone listened to the clip on headphones and played along to it to keep in time. Everyone recorded it on their mobile phones and sent it back to myself and one of the corporals who worked to put it all together, editing the video and sound. And the finished product is what you see.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reverend Richard Coles makes emotional radio tribute to sister-in-law who died from coronavirus</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reverend Richard Coles has paid an emotional radio tribute to his sister-in-law who died on Thursday after contracting coronavirus.
The former Strictly Come Dancing star announced on Instagram earlier this week that Louise had died in hospital as he shared a picture of them smiling together.
Today Richard, 58, spoke about the strength of love and the importance of social distancing as he spoke about the death of Louise, who was married to his brother Andy.
Richard, whose civil partner David also died in December last year, explained Louise received treatment for cancer after being diagnosed earlier this year.
He told BBC Radio Four : "She (Louise) felt unwell over Christmas, a doggedly persistent winter cold she thought, but it was cancer.
"So aggressive was her treatment it left her unprotected. In spite of the most meticulous efforts to shield her from the virus, it breached her defences.
"Louise and Andy had planned how this would go. They knew once she was admitted they could not be together but they were inseparable having found in one another the unequalled compliment a lifetime search that viruses can't touch.
"Love is as strong as death and cannot be quenched."
He also emphasised the same message as the Queen did last month when she addressed the nation by saying: 'We'll meet again.'
Reverend Coles told how Louise had retired from her role of head of sixth form at a school after 17 years, and read out tributes from former pupils.
When the reverend took to social media to pay tribute to Louise on Thursday, he wrote alongside the snap of the pair together: "My lovely sister in law @lozaamandine died this afternoon with COVID19.
"She made lots of people very happy, not least @RevDavidColes, with whom she went on extravagant and unauthorised expeditions to her beloved North Africa.
"RIP, darling woman."
His brother Andy also shared a tribute, saying: "I am very sorry to have to report the death of my wife Louise this afternoon.
"She had been unwell for some time with cancer, but caught coronavirus even while shielding.
"Thankfully we had time to prepare, but this was too soon."
Richard announced David's death last year from a long-term illness.
At the time, he penned: "I'm very sorry to say that @RevDavidColes has died.
"He had been ill for a while. Thanks to the brilliant teams who looked after him @KettGeneral. Funeral details to follow."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bravo Releases Explosive ‘Real Housewives Of Atlanta’ Virtual Reunion Trailer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1, 2020
Elizabeth Randolph
Viewers of The Real Housewives of Atlanta‘s highly-anticipated reunion are ready for its May 10 premiere.
The Inquisitr previously shared the three-part reunion was taped virtually this year. Although the housewives wrapped Season 12 last fall, they were scheduled to return for the special in March. However, filming was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic.
RHOA‘s reunion was filmed at the housewives’ homes. Cast members, NeNe Leakes, Cynthia Bailey, Porsha Williams, Kenya Moore, Eva Marcille, and Kandi Burruss were all onscreen in the opening scene of the trailer. The clip showed all of the women wearing white outfits as they join the call. Host and RHOA executive producer Andy Cohen was in the middle, wearing a blue blazer and tie, per Hollywood Life.
Unsurprisingly, the trailer kicks off with the cast showing off their outfits and rooms. Several of them had silver couches and wall art in the background. Some of the housewives also had flowers and sparkly decor behind them. Leakes kicked off the conversation by making sure her castmates see her on-screen. She was wearing sparkly earrings and AirPods as she gushes about her own appearance.
“Here I am, fabulous and ready to slay,” Leakes said. “Get into it, girls.”
After Leakes’ appearance, the teaser showed some of the explosive fights the ladies will endure. Moore was seen yelling at Marlo Hampton, who’s also in attendance. As the rest of the cast had shocked looks on their faces, Moore said Hampton has “never had a man” since she joined the show. During the season, Hampton and Leakes expressed their opinions about Moore’s husband, Marc Daly.
Williams also had a serious issue to address with one of the women during the reunion. Season 12 caused a divide between Williams and her former friend Marcille. She claimed Marcille brought up her daughter, Pilar Jhena McKinley, while they were having a disagreement. Even though Marcille apologized on the show, Williams felt they couldn’t come back from the altercation.
“First of all, I will never forgive you for ever speaking on my child,” Williams exclaimed as she moved towards the camera. “Do you see me? Do you hear what I am saying?”
Marcille then denied she ever spoke ill about her daughter.
The reunion will also allow Leakes and Burruss to discuss their issues with one another. Burruss hinted back in April the blowup between the two was so intense she predicted they would no longer have a cordial relationship. In the trailer, Burruss said she’s “embedded” in Leakes’ brain. She was also yelling during the scene, which caused Leakes to log out.

One fight later in the game—a fight that wasn’t in the original 1997 classic—highlights everything good about the Remake’s combat.
Final Fantasy VII Remake, unlike the original game, gives you direct control over where party members stand on the battlefield. You don’t just select attacks from a menu, you position yourself and wait until you have enough resources to spend on special attacks or item use. The original game’s “Active Time Battle” system is fantastic, but as modern sensibilities push toward more action-packed battles it was inevitable that Remake, particularly under the partial leadership of Kingdom Hearts director Tetsuya Nomura, would move into real-time combat. It might take a bit of time to get used to, but the change serves the modern retelling well. Characters have special functions: Barrett attacks from a distance with his gun-arm, Tifa’s punches and kicks cause enemies to stagger more quickly. While the original game offered highly customisable functions for each character, Remake seeks to better define their roles. You’re moving around a lot but you’re not running around like a headless chicken. There’s a purpose.
That said, in some moments it breaks down: tight rooms where the camera can’t follow the action, encounters where status effect spewing turtle-men attack a little too quickly, and moments when characters can’t easily use their special abilities. Some of the toughest fights in Remake are rooms of turrets or encounters with flying enemies who hover out of reach or who you can’t quite target as well as you’d like. But when everything comes together? It’s fantastic. To understand the combat system’s strengths, it’s best to look at a single encounter: the fight with Jenova Dreamwalker near the end of the game.
This isn’t a fight from the original game. The party doesn’t fight Jenova, the strange alien-entity, until much later in the PlayStation version. Purists might bristle—the story sequences in Shinra Tower certainly have more than enough boss fights—but this one fight does everything right. From the charged context and presentation, to the arena design and how you achieve fight progress, there’s possibly no better encounter in the game than the battle against Jenova. Why is that?
Well, let’s get the obvious stuff out of the way first: It’s just badass. Cloud and his team have come all this way to Shinra Tower, the heart of the evil corporation, to rescue their friend Aerith. Throughout the story, Cloud has been hounded by the mysterious Sephiroth. When the party confronts President Shinra, Sephiroth strikes. He kills the president and seemingly kills Barrett. The stakes are high, and then? Jenova, a horrible monster beast that pulls the team into a deadly illusion. Fire, acid. The battle’s final phase uses an amped-up remix of her original boss fight music. From scenario to presentation, there’s a lot to love. Heck, you even have a guest party member around to help out: the intelligent wolf-dude Red XIII.
But looking at the fight itself, it’s also very well-designed.
To start, there’s the battle arena. It’s huge! Remake works best when you have plenty of room to manoeuvre. Cramped arenas suck the fun right out of combat, but spaces that allow you to dodge and react quickly in the moment help stress the benefits of having direct control over your character. It also means that you can better “position” your party, if only for a few moments. Characters outside of the player’s direct control act automatically, but if you move quickly enough and swap around it’s possible to time furious attacks from both sides or split up the party to address smaller threats.
That last part is important, as Jenova summons multiple tentacles throughout the fight that litter the room and attack the party as well. While they don’t have a lot of health and you can take them out with one standard combo or ability, they serve a few important functions. The first is practical: They grant charge for the characters’ limit breaks. As characters attack and take damage, they build meters they can spend on a large special move. The tentacles help ensure you can charge and use your Limit Breaks.
More subtly, they offer miniature moments of success throughout the battle. Jenova is a tanky boss and she doesn’t react too much to your hits. You’ll be smacking her with your Buster Sword for maybe 10 minutes on your first playthrough. Phases where you fend off the tentacles offer small victories that create a sense of forward momentum. You’re hacking the monster to pieces, you’re fighting the Hydra and cutting off head after head. Since the tentacles spawn all over the room, you need to rush around and actively pay attention to your surroundings. You can’t simply tunnel vision on Jenova. The reward for being attentive isn’t simply additional safety but a sense of progression.
The large space and multiple attack targets provide you with options. By this point, characters will have powered-up magic, multiple unique abilities unlocked, powerful summons, and more. This is a chance to use all of them freely and with spectacular results. Jenova can inflict multiple status effects on the player ranging from Poison to Stop, and can grab characters until other party members rush in to free them. There is always something to do, some reason to dig into your bag of tools.
Remake follows up this fight with boss battles that restrict player options: Cloud’s duel against Rufus Shinra punishes aggressive play with nasty counters, Aerith and Barrett battle against a Shinra mech that constricts space by summoning walls of fire. But Jenova gives you a chance to be bold, and damn does it feel good.
The battle is a playground. A fierce playground with monsters and techno-music that gives players space to express themselves. Other battles constrict and press in. That’s a great way to create a challenge but every now and then you gotta cut loose. What better time than against the nightmarish projection of an ancient alien monster?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cyntoia Brown love story: Marriage and children plans after 15 years in prison</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cyntoia Brown's nightmare battle for justice has gone global - with a hit Netflix documentary, star backing and follow on book on the way.
But after the Netflix cameras stopped rolling the now justice campaigner Cyntoia, 32, had to begin paving a new life for herself post release with a husband, plans for children and a potential law career.
In fact, even before Cyntoia had left prison she married rapper Jamie Long - who inspired her to believe she would eventually become a free woman.
Long said he first discovered Cyntoia and her plight on a 2011 YouTube video, saying he felt compelled to watch her: "I felt God tell me, stop and write her. I told her basically, 'God told me to tell you you're getting out of prison'."
He sent the letter in 2017 and even burnt the edges to make it stand out from her other fan mail.
"There was just something about him," Cyntoia said and four months latert they met face t o face.
"When I went in to see her, I knew right then she would be my wife. I bought my wife's wedding ring while she was still in prison, and we didn't know if she was getting out," he said, recalling their romance.
They got engaged two years later and married before she was released in 2019.
They plan on starting a family, with her husband saying: "I want to settle down and start a family. I want to live for you and please you. This time I got it right, and I know I got it right."
Since her release, Brown-Long has gone on a national speaking tour and is thinking about law school.
Cyntonia was released on August 7 last year after her life sentence was commuted to 15 years.
She admitted killing Johnny Michael after he solicited her for sex - he was aged 43, she was a very young looking 16.
Since her conviction both Tennessee and American law changed significantly over the sentencing of minors for serious crimes and millions protested about the length of jail time for Cyntoia, an at-risk-child at the mercy of a series of a predatory men.
