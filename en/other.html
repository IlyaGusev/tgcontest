    <h5 class="mb-1">Forecast for the rest of the weekend is fab - but it's all going to change next week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The weather forecast for the rest of the Bank Holiday weekend is for sunshine and high temperatures -but the national forecaster warns of heavy rain on the way.
Met Eireann has forecast temperatures of up to 18 degrees for Monday, with plenty of sunshine and some light breezes.
Today is to remain dry in most places, but with a spot of ran or drizzle along the southern coast.Â Top temperatures will be 12 to 16 degrees, and it will be warmest through parts of north midlands and Connacht.
The good weather will last throughout Bank Holiday Monday, with sunny spells across the country and remaining mostly dry. Highest temperatures will range from 12 to 18 degrees, and it is expected to be warmer in the west.
The weather is expected to change as we move through the week, however, with heavy rain showers and a drop in temperatures expected.
Met Eireann said: "There is some uncertainty but latest indications suggest Tuesday will bring rain across parts of Munster and south Leinster, with some heavy falls in places in the morning but the rain will tend to ease later in the day.
"Holding mostly dry further north with some sunny breaks in northern parts. Afternoon temperatures of 10 to 13 degrees in southern and eastern areas, 14 to 16 degrees in the midlands and west with moderate to fresh southeast breezes."
As we head into Wednesday, the outlook is for further rain showers across the country, especially in the south and west. Temperatures will range from 12 to 16 degrees, but we could see it creep up to 18 degrees at times.
So essentially, we'll be able to move within 5km of our homes - but we'll have to bring our brollies.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sun set to shine as temperatures soar to 18 degrees</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The sun will be splitting the rocks next week with temperatures set to soar to highs of 18 degrees from tomorrow.
Dry and sunny spells will develop on Monday as forecasters expect daytime temperatures to hit highs between 12 and 14 degrees across eastern northern coasts tomorrow while the rest of the country enjoys highs of 15 to 18 degrees.
Met Eireann forecaster Linda Hughes said Monday will be the best day for warm temperatures and sunshine.
"Tomorrow really is looking like it's going to be the best day of the week ahead, it will be dry across the country.
"There will be an easterly breeze though so along the east and north coast that's going to keep the temperatures down tomorrow to about 12 to 14 degrees, and but then across the rest of the country it's a pretty warm day tomorrow with highs of 15 to 18, degrees, so it will feel pleasant in the sunshine tomorrow," she said.
Tomorrow night will be dry in most areas with overnight lows of 4 to 8 degrees.
However, the good weather will be interrupted as forecasters say latest indications show Tuesday will be hit with heavy rainfall across parts of Munster and Leinster.
The wet weather will ease later in the day as temperatures will rise to 10 to 13 degrees in southern and eastern areas, and 14 to 16 degrees in the midlands and west .
Temperatures will surge again over Wednesday and Thursday with forecasters anticipating afternoon highs of 12 to 16 degrees and potentially 17 or 18 degrees in some central regions on Thursday.
Southeast breezes may bring outbreaks of showery rain especially to southern, western and southeastern counties.
As for this evening, forecasters have predicted dry and chilly conditions with some drizzle near southwestern coasts.
Temperatures will dip between 1 and 3 degrees or 4 to 6 degrees under thicker cloud in parts of the south and west.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Irish weather forecast: Warm and sunny day ahead but country set to be soaked next week</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the last Spring month upon us Ireland has been treated to an inviting sun soaked bank holiday weekend- but that looks set to end very soon.
Met Eireann has said today will be mostly dry today with temperatures set to hit between 12C and 16C.
However patches of drizzle and cloudy conditions will appear in the south west and the south coast while isolated showers will pop up elsewhere this afternoon.
It will be warmest through parts of north midlands and Connacht with light, occasionally moderate, easterly or variable breezes expected.
Tomorrow will be largely dry with as the country is set to be basked in sunn spells throughout the day.
East to northeast breezes will increase moderate in the afternoon, keeping daytime highs between 12 and 14 degrees near eastern and northern coasts.
Luckily for punters in the west it will be warmer further west with afternoon highs of 15 to 18 degrees.
Sadly Monday night looks likely to mark the end of the sunshine as the country is set to be soaked in the coming days.
A forecaster has warned there is "some uncertainty" for Tuesday but said "latest indications suggest Tuesday will bring rain across parts of Munster and south Leinster."
He said: "Some heavy falls in places in the morning but the rain will tend to ease later in the day.
"Holding mostly dry further north with some sunny breaks in northern parts. Afternoon temperatures of 10C to 13C in southern and eastern areas."
The midlands and the west will be warmer however temperatures reaching highs of 14C to 16C with moderate to fresh southeast breezes.
Unfortunately the rain will persist mainly affecting southern coastal counties.
Further north it will be drier and clearer with temperature hitting lows of 5C to 9C in moderate east to southeast breezes.
The predominant signal is for southeast breezes to bring outbreaks of showery rain especially to southern, western and southeastern counties.
But those further north can rejoice with Met Eireann predicting that northern areas are likely to be dry much of the time.
Temperatures in the afternoon will reach highs of 12C to 16C and potentially 17C or 18C in some central regions of the country on Thursday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Building heat, gusty winds may fuel wildfire concerns in California</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3 (UPI) -- AccuWeather meteorologists are closely monitoring the hot, gusty pattern poised to set up over California later this week, which could elevate the risk of wildfires in parts of the state.
Intense heat gripped California during the latter part of April, but ample rainfall in southern areas earlier in the month and a lack of wind minimized the risk of early season blazes breaking out.
Temperatures will start to ramp up on Tuesday as an area of high pressure builds over the region, with each day into late week becoming increasingly hotter.
By the middle and latter part of the week, high temperatures are forecast to soar back into the lower 80s in San Diego, upper 80s to lower 90s in Downtown Los Angeles and in the 100s Fahrenheit across the deserts.
Record-challenging temperatures are not expected to be widespread with this round of heat, but a few locales could challenge daily high marks. This includes in Lancaster, Ontario, Palm Springs and Riverside.
Farther north, across the Sacramento Valley, temperatures will trend upward as well with highs mainly in the 80s on Tuesday and Wednesday and then 90s on Thursday and Friday.
Californians will have to find creative ways to cool off while outside as heading to the beach may not be an option for everyone.
Late this past week, Gov. Gavin Newsom closed state beaches in Orange County, where large crowds were seen gathering as heat ramped up during the final weekend of April.
"We want you to enjoy sunsets, we want you to enjoy activities outdoors," Newsom said at a press briefing last Thursday. "The only thing we don't want you to do is linger."
Anyone who does spend time outside, while maintaining proper social distancing, should drink plenty of water, wear sunscreen and have a hat handy amid the hot pattern. Remember to never leave pets or children in a sealed vehicle for any length of time.
For those seeking heat relief near streams with the beaches closed, there are other dangers to be aware of and take precautions against," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Alex Sosnowski said.
Those heading to the mountains to cool off should keep in mind that lakes and rivers are still dangerously cold following the winter months.
"The surging temperatures can accelerate the spring thaw in the mountains causing streams to run fast and furious. Water temperatures will be only a few degrees above freezing, which is cold enough to lead to dangerous cold water shock should anyone fall in or get swept away by raging waters," Sosnowski said.
Dry weather will accompany the warm up, along with increasing winds.
"With wildfire season starting to get underway and drought conditions already at extreme levels in parts of Northern California, the risk for fires will increase with this wind event," AccuWeather Senior Meteorologist Brian Thompson said.
"Many places in Northern California have only received 30 to 60 percent of normal rainfall so far this year," Thompson added.
Farther south, Thompson expects a Sundowner wind event to get underway around Wednesday and Thursday.
While the threat of wildfire ignition and spread may be lower in Southern California due a surplus of rainfall during April, now that the ground has begun to dry out the risk will not be zero.
AccuWeather will continue to provide updates on where the fire risk may be highest in the coming days.
Residents should be extra cautious using outdoor power equipment as well as any outdoor flames during the latter part of this week. Cigarette butts should also be properly discarded.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK weather: Sunshine and 22C set to bake Britain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A 22C heatwave is set to sweep across the country next week, just in time for the May Bank Holiday.
From today (Sunday), the mercury will continue to climb until it peaks at 22C on Thursday, according to weather.com.
Forecasters say Friday will be slightly cloudier, although temperatures should hit 21C, reports the Mirror.
Speaking about next week's glorious weather, a spokesman for netweather.tv said: "High pressure will build in from the north on Monday, bringing a largely dry day with sunny spells, though a few showers are likely across northern and eastern England, especially in the morning.
"Tuesday will likely see a frontal system with outbreaks of heavy rain try to push in across the south against high pressure establishing across the north.
"Cloud and rain (will) ease back to the near continent by Wednesday, with high pressure close to or over the UK dominating the weather for the rest of the week, so Wednesday and Thursday mostly dry and fine with sunny spells, warmer too with light winds.
"Most looking dry on Friday too, but we may see showers arrive in the west as high pressure begins to retreat, but some uncertainty on this."
Europe is also likely to see a spike in temperatures next week.
On Monday the mercury will hit 32C in Spain, 29C in France and 24C in Swizerland, according to weatheronline.co.uk.
And there's more good news, as the sunny weather is expected to continue beyond next week.

The Met Office's long range forecast predicts 'sunny and bright spells for most' before the weather turns unsettled towards the middle of the month.
It comes after the sunniest April on record in the UK.
Today will be mainly cloudy in Bristol, with temperatures peaking at 15C.
Another day of sunny intervals and showers for many northern and eastern parts. Cloudier in the south and southwest with perhaps some light rain or drizzle in the far southwest.
Dry and fine for many areas throughout. Although cloudier with some rain in the Midlands and northeast of England on Monday, and heavy, thundery rain for the southwest on Tuesday.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SOUTHLAND - (INT) - The springtime heat has been on pause for the opening of May. But, the big weather story this week will be the next heat wave. Temperatures will start climbing Monday reaching the 90s in most valleys and some coastal areas and by Thursday could max out in triple digits. Some records are likely to be set. A Heat Advisory Tuesday through Friday covers all valleys while an Excessive Heat Watch bakes the Coachella Valley and the lower deserts. Temperatures in all areas will range up to 15-20 degrees above normal. The heat will gradually subside Friday through the weekend.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK weather forecast â Britain to bask in balmy 17C sunshine to end week-long washout</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRITS have been treated to a return of spring weather this weekend, with warm temperatures set to continue.
The balmy sunshine is expected to stick around on Sunday, reaching 17C across much of the country.
After a week of drizzle and gloom in lockdown, the UK has basked in some light relief today.
The low pressure which has dumped torrential rain on much of the country this week has been forecast to move across Europe.
And as the UK spends its sixth weekend in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, weather conditions are expected to be much more settled thanks to building high pressure.
According to The Met Office, the change will result in âdry, fine and settled weatherâ this weekend and particularly next week.
Saturday was warm with a high of 19C felt by most of the country.
Further dry, fine and settled weather is expected on Sunday, with potential for very light winds - however most places will enjoy âdry and decent weather.â
Sunday
The Met Office predict most of the country will see sunny intervals, however some rain could fall in northern and eastern parts of the nation.
For most of the country, a high of 17C will be felt, and a low of 8C.
Monday to Wednesday
Mainly dry, sunny spells developing, few showers in Eastern England on Monday. Mainly dry, sunny spells in most places, but heavy showers in SW Tuesday. Dry and sunny on Wednesday.
On Sunday, cloudier conditions are expected in the south and southwest with perhaps some light rain or drizzle in the far southwest.
Some parts of the east coast will feel more of a chill in the air.
The high pressure will remain in charge for most of next week, meaning the warm sunny weather is here to stay for at least a few more days.
The Met Office warns that while the weather change will tempt many across the country to spend their weekend outdoors, the UK must continue to adhere to the coronavirus lockdown.
Simon Partridge encouraged people to enjoy the sunshine from their backyards, balconies and daily hour-long walks - though he did add that UV levels will be reasonably high over the weekend, so people must cover up accordingly.
The high pressure build wonât last forever, and is expected to move on by the following weekend and bring with it more wet and miserable weather.
Ministers will be hoping the resurgence of sunshine will not encourage Brits to venture outside of their homes and break lockdown rules as has been seen in the past few weeks.
For the beginning of next week, the weather still appears to be setting with the occasional shower in Eastern England on Monday ad heavy showers in the southwest on Tuesday.
Generally the UK will remain dry with some sunny spells, particularly on Wednesday.
The sunshine comes after Britain experienced as much rain in a day as it did for the rest of April two days ago.
The Met Office is now predicting settled, warmer weather for the beginning of the month, although we can still expect some showers, and it'll be much cooler than last week.
April's sunshine was caused by a high pressure system from the continent - but recently we've faced the opposite, with low pressure systems bringing in colder weather and lots of rain.

    <h5 class="mb-1">UK weather forecast: Temperatures to hit 18C as rain gives way to spring sunshine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's set to be a bright and sunny day today with temperatures forecast to reach a balmy 18C.
Brits will be treated to a return of spring weather as the low pressure which has dumped torrential rain on much of the country this week is now forecast to move across Europe.
Many areas are set to see temperatures get warmer, with the Met Office predicting highs of 17 to 18C in the southeast, with 14 to 15C felt across the UK.
Lows of 12C are forecast in Newcastle and Edinburgh.
As the UK spends its sixth weekend in lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, conditions are also due to be drier and more settled thanks to building high pressure.
However, the odd shower is possible and some could turn heavy, particularly in the north and east of the country.
Giving the latest forecast, a Met Office spokesman said: "Despite the chilly start it will soon warm up, plenty of sunshine for England, Wales, southern Scotland and Northern Ireland.
"As temperatures build, further showers will develop. It's essentially a day of sunny spells and showers but it's across central and eastern England where the heaviest and most frequent downpours will be.
"Further south, the best of any sunshine 17 or 18C in the southeast.
"Showers will continue to ease away as we head into Saturday evening but still one or two clinging on, a bit more cloud into Cornwall perhaps one or two spots of rain.
"Sunday is looking largely dry with showers easing and a bit more sunshine."
Today:
A chilly start then sunny intervals and showers, some heavy in the north and east. Many western and southern areas remaining dry but becoming cloudier with perhaps a little rain in the far southwest later. Feeling warm in the sunshine.
Tonight:
Showers dying out to leave a chilly night with clear spells for many central parts. Cloudier in the northeast and southwest with some patchy rain in places.
Sunday:
Another day of sunny intervals and showers for many northern and eastern parts. Cloudier in the south and southwest with perhaps some light rain or drizzle in the far southwest.
Monday to Wednesday :
Mainly dry, sunny spells developing, few showers in Eastern England on Monday. Mainly dry, sunny spells in most places, but heavy showers in SW Tuesday. Dry and sunny on Wednesday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Horoscope: May 3-9 - Heather's Horoscope</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OVERVIEW:Â The sun in the sign of Taurus places a stronger focus on finances, the markets and any efforts made to stabilize. Cut losses and pull practical plans together no matter what is needed. Navigate around circumstances. Efforts made will get results on most levels.Â Those with power behind the scenes add some influence in the right departments as they see they will benefit from this as well. Play the long game if you can do it. Private deals will provide compensation for any up front costs. The full moon in Scorpio agitates those with intense emotions. A poker face is useful right now while negotiating terms or positions. Plan next moves.
ARIES: You can be the key player in any dealings with others as you engage and take charge.
TAURUS: Be the star near or far as your feet-on-the-ground methods calm the anxiety of others.Â 
GEMINI: Play cards very close to the vest. It's better if others donât know your level of influence.
CANCER: You need all the information or evidence required to convince others to work with you.Â 
LEO: You shine in the eyes of others as they see what a trooper you are. Take charge if you can.Â 
VIRGO: A hands-on approach helps your agenda or clear your path. Brainstorm with others now.Â 
LIBRA: Clarify details regarding finances or assets that could also be connected jointly to them.
SCORPIO: Measure your words carefully or your intensity could alter the status quo. Just relax.Â 
SAGITTARIUS: Private deals are a win-win for all involved. Process everything in the right order.Â 
CAPRICORN: Your steady, stable personality calms others and attracts some good luckÂ to you.Â 
AQUARIUS: Take a stand if you have to be the one in charge as your leadership is important.
PISCES: Play a bit of a shell game with associates for now. You need to feel your way with this.Â

    <h5 class="mb-1">May 3: Your daily horoscope</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Week Ahead Stars for Sunday, May 3rd
BIRTHDAY SUNDAY:You cannot possibly be the best at everything, so don't waste your time and energy trying. Cut back on your ambitions this year and focus only on the two or three goals that are easiest to reach. That's not an admission of failure, it's a sign of maturity.
ARIES (March 21 - April 20):A relationship or friendship has been a lot of fun but now it may be time to move on to something new. If you do go your separate ways make sure it is on good terms. You never know when you might want to get back together again.
TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):Just because someone says they will support you does not mean they actually will, so don't get into a position where your success depends entirely on them. You may not want to be cynical but ultimately the only person you can fully trust is yourself.
GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):Listen carefully to friends and family members whose knowledge in certain areas is clearly superior to your own, then make your choice as to whether or not you will take their advice. The final say in the matter must always go to your conscience.
CANCER (June 22 - July 23):If you have kept things hidden from partners and loved ones you must now come clean and let them know what's been going on. It may be no big deal to you but they could lose trust in you if you continue to keep them in the dark.
LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):Your powers of persuasion can get you just about anything you desire, but make sure other people don't lose out as a result. You win best when other people win with you, so whatever you ask for make sure friends and relatives get a fair share too.
VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):You could face a serious problem if you let slip information you should have kept to yourself. The powers that be won't be impressed that you could not be trusted and may decide not to trust you again, so keep your lips zipped over the next 24 hours!
LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):You must not be afraid to make unpopular decisions, but on the other hand you must not make them when there are other options available that could work just as well. Remember too that the quickest route to success is not always the best route .
SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):Something or someone will come into your life over the next few days that does you a power of good. It may be that something or someone else has to go out of your life to make room for it, or them, but that's life. Don't be too sentimental.
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):If there is something you would rather be doing than what others expect you to be doing then you need to let them know there are going to be changes. No one can blame you for getting bored with your current regime â and you wouldn't care if they did.
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):You should by now have a much clearer idea of what it is you want to be doing over the coming weeks and months. You may not be able to move towards your new goals just yet but you can make detailed plans. Start on them now.
AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):No matter how eager you may be to press ahead with something that excites you there are a number of other issues that must be dealt with first. Sadly, there are people out there who would love to see you fail. Don't give them a chance to criticize you.
PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):Something has been worrying you for some time and you really do need to sort it out. To start with you must be honest with yourself about why you fear it so much. Once you have done that you may find it has less of a hold over you.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Today's horoscope â May 3, 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HAPPY BIRTHDAY for Sunday, May 3, 2020. Insightful, clever and charming, you create a winner of a year. New financial opportunities appear in May, August, and December. Make choices and pursue goals on Fridays, your lucky day each week. If single, you postpone the decisive action needed to ensure success in love. If attached, you, who place a lot of demands on your partner, decide to ease up, and romantic bliss ensues. CAPRICORN makes their own decisions.
Â 
ARIES (March 21-April 19): A former physical complaint manifests itself again, mainly due to stress. You are so brave and you've kept it in for so long. But today, find time to take care of yourself. Good news comes your way, in financial form. Tonight: Take it easy.
This Week: Zero in on a new possibility Wednesday or Thursday.
Â 
TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Children are the happy focus of the day. After a few nights of restless sleep, brilliant ideas abound. Fresh personal starts are indicated. Expect to be doing a lot of brainstorming. A creative project will go very well. Tonight: Play more with the children.
This Week: You make a difference because of your abilities.
Â 
GEMINI (May 21-June 20): Today finds you redecorating your home. Moods are high, and in keeping with your already expansive way, rather overindulgent. There's nothing small or petty about the way you decorate, especially not now. You go all out. Tonight: Celebrate with a wonderful dinner.
This Week: Speak your mind and expect to get responses.
Â 
CANCER (June 21-July 22): You seem to be doing a lot of thinking, talking and local running around. Naturally analytical, you use this period profitably by re-examining plans or ideas and discarding whatever or whomever is no longer valuable. This is particularly advantageous for you writers. Tonight: Early sleep.
This Week: You might be more grounded than most people.
Â 
LEO (July 23-Aug 22): You feel like buying, and could go a bit overboard. Luxury items have a very strong appeal. However, today's aspects are not good for large-scale spending, as you will most likely have to return what you purchase. Tonight: Distract yourself with a beloved movie.
This Week: Others will seek you out.
Â 
VIRGO (Aug 23-Sept 22): Your personal magnetism is high, and you attract the attention of a VIP. But be careful. You get in over your head, and conflict may accompany an immense sex appeal. Do not use others, nor let yourself be used. Tonight: The emphasis continues on you.
This Week: You decide to take on certain risks.
Â 
LIBRA (Sept 23-Oct 22): Take care of yourself mentally or physically since you could find yourself more rundown than usual. Sleep, meditate and think. You begin to find your thoughts deepened and intensified as you dig for answers with vigorous determination. Tonight: Avoid power struggles with others.
This Week: You bloom midweek. Cheer in summer with friends.
Â 
SCORPIO (Oct 23-Nov 21): Communication and enthusiasm from others thrill you today. The focus is on friendship and group activities that you follow online. Accept the many invitations that come your way. You feel more popular than you have in some time. Tonight: Flaunt yourself, Scorpio-style.
This Week: Let others run the show.
Â 
SAGITTARIUS (Nov 22-Dec 21): Today emphasises fun and good times, particularly with an elderly relative. Make sure you check in and see that everything is all right. Try not to let minor hassles at the workplace upset your equilibrium. Co-workers seem to be in an uproar. Tonight: Take off.
Â 
This Week: Work toward a goal you have envisioned.
Â 
CAPRICORN (Dec 22-Jan 19): You seem to have a case of wanderlust today. As you cannot go on a real vacation, take a virtual one. The yearning will also be quenched by browsing through travel books or even just calling a long-distance pal. Tonight: Spend time with a child.
This Week: Focus on what you want.
Â 
AQUARIUS (Jan 20-Feb 18): Joint income improves today, although there may be a few disagreements with your partner along the way. Obtaining loans is favoured, but some might feel unduly pressured to make a financial decision. You need to do your best balancing act. Tonight: Play nice.
This Week: Kick back and think of summer.
Â 
PISCES (Feb 19-March 20): A new friendship might be found with a fiery, communicative person. You are likely to share similar outlooks and will learn from each other. Watch out, however, for domestic or romantic discord at home. If attached, your mate is volatile. Tonight: Relax.
This Week: Relate on a one-on-one basis.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How And When To See The âSuper Flower Moonâ Rise This Week, The Fourth And Final Supermoon Of 2020</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Are you ready for just one more supermoon in 2020?
This Thursday sees the rise of the âSuper Flower Moon,â the fourth and final so-called supermoon of the year.
Exactly how special is the âSuper Flower Moon?â Given that there have been three overly large full moons in a row so far in 2020, you could be forgiven for thinking that the âSuper Flower Moonâ is not particularly special.
All full moons are special, but only if you get your timing exactly right.Â 
The trick with any full moonâand particularly a supermoonâis to be in the right place at the right time.
So hereâs everything you need to know about when and how to get a great view of the final supermoon of the year.Â 
A supermoon, also known as a perigee full moon by astronomers, is a colloquialâeven astrologicalâterm for a full Moon when itâs at its closest point to Earth in its orbit. Although itâs only a slight effect, it may appear bigger and brighter in the sky.
This month, the Moon will enter its full phaseâentirely lit-up by the Sun as seen from Earthâat 10:45 Universal Time on Thursday, May 7, 2020. You can convert that to you local time, but it may be during the day. That doesnât matter. In fact, itâs ideal since it means you can watch a 99%-lit full moon at both moonset on the morning of May 7, and at moonrise later that same day.Â 
The best time to see any full Moon, and particularly a supermoon, is when itâs close to the horizon. Firstly, your brain make the Moon seem bigger because itâs rising between buildings/trees/mountains/landmarks. Secondly, youâll be looking at the Moon through the thickest part of Earthâs atmosphere, so rather than the bright, white orb it appears as when itâs high in the sky, it will appear to be a deep orange color (when rising or setting) and an entrancing pale yellow color (when just above the horizon). Just like the Sun at sunset.Â 
You really don't need anything apart from good timing and a reasonably high observing location (a second-floor window is fine) to see the rise of the âSuper Flower Moon.â Hereâs how to get organised:Â 
Perhaps the most important thing to remember is that the specific time the Moon appears on your horizon will be a little bit later than apps and charts will tell you. After all, the Moon has to rise above anything on the horizon, and any buildings blocking your view, before you will see it. So get in position just after the Moon is due to rise in your location, and stay there for at least 15 minutes. You will see it, if the skies are clear. The only way of definitely not seeing the âSuper Flower Moonâ is to run out of patience too early and step away from the window or go back indoors.Â 
The next time the moon comes closest to Earth while in its full phase is on April 27, 2021 to create a âSuper Pink Moonâ.Â 
Wishing you clear skies and wide eyes.Â

ARIES (March 21 - April 20):The Sun and Mercury may no longer be moving through your sign but that does not mean your recent run of good fortune is coming to an end. On the contrary, you may be even better off over the next few weeks, at least financially, than you were before.
TAURUS (April 21 - May 21):With so much positive cosmic activity in and around your birth sign you should be dancing for joy now. You say you can't dance? Of course you can! Switch off your inner critic and let your body guide you. No one will laugh at you â honest!
GEMINI (May 22 - June 21):There seems to be a certain amount of tension in your life at the moment but most likely it's just all those annoying little things that appear to add up to something big. But they don't. It will all come right in the end â somehow it always does.
CANCER (June 22 - July 23):Friends and colleagues will applaud you to the skies this weekend, and with good reason. In their eyes, and in the eyes of the universe in general, you can do no wrong, so follow your fancies and do as you please. You'll get away with almost anything.
LEO (July 24 - Aug. 23):Cosmic activity in the career area of your chart will boost both your energy and self-belief and it won't be long before you are moving up in the world. Try not to let your success go to your head though. You're not the only big cheese in the neighborhood.
VIRGO (Aug. 24 - Sept. 23):Your sense of adventure, which has been somewhat dormant of late, will suddenly come alive again and in a matter of days you will be flying intellectually and emotionally, and maybe physically too. Give yourself permission to dream â and dream big!
LIBRA (Sept. 24 - Oct. 23):Business and financial matters are under excellent stars now, so be ready to cash in when the opportunity arises. Ignore those who try to tell you that it's wrong to be rich. At the very least they are misguided and may even have their own selfish agenda.
SCORPIO (Oct. 24 - Nov. 22):Try not to get worked up about something that is clearly unattainable, at least for the foreseeable future. Focus on the things you can have and, even if they are not all to your liking, find ways to enjoy them, not least by expanding your definition of fun.
SAGITTARIUS (Nov. 23 - Dec. 21):You need to stop worrying about a relationship â the planets indicate there is precious little wrong with it that can't be put right with a little tender loving care. Venus in the partnership area of your chart will, if you let it, bring harmony back into your life.
CAPRICORN (Dec. 22 - Jan. 20):You will find yourself being nudged in a new direction this weekend and if you are sensible enough not to resist you could end up in a place that brings out the best in you. Expand your horizons and always believe that life should be fun.
AQUARIUS (Jan. 21 - Feb. 19):No matter how awkward a problem may be you will find a solution this weekend, but you will find it quicker if you join forces with those who share your need to make sense of what is going on in the world. You all have something to contribute.
PISCES (Feb. 20 - Mar. 20):The pace of life is picking up again and it won't be long before you are hurtling along at speeds that in the past you might have found scary. You have lots of lost time to make up for, so get your mental running shoes on and race ahead.
