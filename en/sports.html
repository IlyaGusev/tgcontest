    <h5 class="mb-1">Gary Neville claims Premier League are ‘frightened’ to back season restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gary Neville has criticised the Premier League and its clubs for failing to make the case for a return to action.
The former Manchester United and England defender accused them of being “frightened to death” to publicly back plans to restart the season for fear of being held liable should something go wrong.
Premier League clubs met on Friday to reaffirm their commitment to resuming the campaign and are understood to have earmarked June 8 as a best-case scenario to return following the coronavirus suspension.
But Neville feels there has been too much anonymous briefing and not enough public declarations.
Neville wrote on Twitter: “The PL are having a CV nightmare. They keep spouting Health First but then brief constantly “We have to Re-Start”. I’d respect them more if they said “We accept the increase in Health Risk but it’s one we are willing to take”. They won’t as they are frightened to death!”
When Neville was asked by a Twitter user what would happen if someone died as a result of the restart, he said: “That’s why we haven’t heard one single prominent CEO / Chairman / Owner or Executive open his mouth to back the re-start ! Brief / Brief / Brief ! Scared to death of the liability and blame.”
Before making an exception for Brighton as the “only club willing to take a stand”, Neville added: “It would be good for them to speak at least once. Any of them! Clubs included. They are bottling this virus on comms. Very Happy to tell us when they are delivering food parcels though.”
The Premier League announced on Friday that clubs had again confirmed their commitment to finishing the season.
A statement added: “The League and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with Government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers.
“The League welcomed the creation of the Government medical working group for a return of elite sport, which met for the first time this morning.
“No decisions were taken at today’s shareholders’ meeting and clubs exchanged views on the information provided regarding ‘Project Restart’.”
Brighton have held virtual press conferences during the shutdown and chief executive Paul Barber voiced opposition to the idea of finishing the season at neutral venues on his club’s official website on Saturday.
West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady revealed more details about the plans in a newspaper column on Saturday and Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish made the case for returning to action in a Sunday Times column.
Parish claimed the return of football, if considered appropriate, would be a boost to the taxpayer, lift the nation’s mental health and could help provide a blueprint for other industries to define a “new normal” amid the pandemic.
Neville later praised Parish for speaking out after being alerted to the article by the Palace chairman but reiterated his general point.
The TV pundit wrote: “Steve I want football to return. I also understand the complexities. However it’s depressing that the PL and clubs seem to be in hiding, scared to death of communicating. No-one wants to be responsible for this one! Just in case the unthinkable happens.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gary Neville says Premier League clubs ‘frightened to death’ about speaking out on season’s restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gary Neville has accused Premier League clubs of being “frightened to death” to publicly back the plan to restart the season.
Premier League stakeholders met on Friday to debate how to finish the current campaign, with reports that some clubs want to abandon the season due to the coronavirus pandemic and others are keen to play all remaining 92 fixtures.
Former Manchester United defender Neville believes clubs do not want to be held liable should a player become ill with the coronavirus if the English season resumes.
The French and Dutch seasons have been called off because of the health crisis and while the Premier League have apparently ear-marked a June return, that date is far from set in stone.
Claiming there needs to be more public comment from clubs, Neville wrote on Twitter: “The PL are having a [coronavirus] nightmare. They keep spouting Health First but then brief constantly ‘We have to Re-Start’.
“I’d respect them more if they said ‘We accept the increase in Health Risk but it’s one we are willing to take’. They won’t as they are frightened to death!”
When Neville was asked by a Twitter user what would happen if someone died as a result of the restart, he said: “That’s why we haven’t heard one single prominent CEO / Chairman / Owner or Executive open his mouth to back the re-start !

Brighton have held virtual press conferences during the shutdown and chief executive Paul Barber voiced opposition to the idea of finishing the season at neutral venues on his club’s official website on Saturday.
Despite Neville’s out-spoken claims, Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish did make the case for returning to action in a Sunday Times column.
“I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the ‘new normal’ might look for a lot of working environments,” Parish wrote.
“Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis.
“In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?”
Neville later praised Parish for speaking out after being alerted to the article by the Palace chairman.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League, clubs ‘scared’ to publicly back restart — Ex-Manchester United player</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Share on FacebookShare on Twitter
The Premier League in England and its clubs are “frightened to death” about publicly backing the resumption of the season, television pundit Gary Neville said on Sunday.
Neville said this was because they do not want to be held liable if someone dies because of the coronavirus.
Professional football has been suspended since mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has infected over 182,000 people in the United Kingdom, killing more than 28,000.
The 20 Premier League clubs held a conference call on Friday in which they looked at plans for a resumption of training this month.
But they deferred making a decision on resuming the season until the government gave the go-ahead.
The government had originally set May 7 as the day it would review lockdown restrictions.
“The PL are having a CV nightmare. They keep spouting health first but then brief constantly ‘We have to re-start’,” Neville wrote on Twitter.
“I’d respect them more if they said, ‘We accept the increase in health risk, but it’s one we are willing to take’. They won’t, as they are frightened to death!”
When a Twitter user asked him what would happen if they restarted the season and someone died, Neville said: “That’s why we haven’t heard one single prominent CEO, Chairman, owner or executive open his mouth to back the re-start.
“Scared to death of the liability and blame.”
The clubs have reviewed plans for resuming training, which will initially be restricted to small groups of players with no use of indoor facilities.
Some clubs started individual sessions for players at their training grounds last week.
Neville said although he understands the complexities of a return to action, it was “depressing” to see the league and clubs not communicating their plans.
“It would be good for them (the Premier League) to speak at least once. Any of them! Clubs included,” the former Manchester United and England defender added when it was suggested to him that the league has press briefings.
“They are bottling this virus on comms (communications). Very happy to tell us when they are delivering food parcels though.”

Premier League stakeholders met on Friday to debate how to finish the current campaign, with reports that some clubs want to abandon the season due to the pandemic and others are keen to play all remaining 92 fixtures.
Former Manchester United defender Neville believes clubs do not want to be held liable should a player become ill with the coronavirus if the English season resumes.
The French and Dutch seasons have been called off because of the health crisis and while the Premier League have apparently ear-marked a June return, that date is far from set in stone.
Claiming there needs to be more public comment from clubs, Neville wrote on Twitter: “The PL are having a CV nightmare. They keep spouting Health First but then brief constantly ‘We have to Re-Start’.
“I’d respect them more if they said ‘We accept the increase in Health Risk but it’s one we are willing to take’. They won’t as they are frightened to death!”
When Neville was asked by a Twitter user what would happen if someone died as a result of the restart, he said: “That’s why we haven’t heard one single prominent CEO / Chairman / Owner or Executive open his mouth to back the re-start ! Brief / Brief / Brief ! Scared to death of the liability and blame.”
Before making an exception for Brighton as the “only club willing to take a stand”, Neville added: “It would be good for them to speak at least once. Any of them! Clubs included. They are bottling this virus on comms. Very Happy to tell us when they are delivering food parcels though.”
Brighton have held virtual press conferences during the shutdown and chief executive Paul Barber voiced opposition to the idea of finishing the season at neutral venues on his club’s official website on Saturday.
Despite Neville’s out-spoken claims, Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish did make the case for returning to action in a Sunday Times column.
“I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the ‘new normal’ might look for a lot of working environments,” Parish wrote.
“Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis.
“In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?”
Neville later praised Parish for speaking out after being alerted to the article by the Palace chairman.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Premier League, clubs scared to publicly back restart’: Gary Neville</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Premier League and its clubs are “frightened to death” about publicly backing the resumption of the season as they do not want to be held liable if someone dies because of the coronavirus, television pundit Gary Neville said on Sunday.
Professional football has been suspended since mid-March due to the COVID-19pandemic which has infected over 182,000 people in the United Kingdom, killing more than 28,000.
The 20 Premier League clubs held a conference call on Friday in which they looked at plans for a resumption of training this month but deferred making a decision on resuming the season until the government gave the go-ahead.
The government had originally set May 7 as the day it would review lockdown restrictions.
“The PL are having a CV nightmare. They keep spouting health first but then brief constantly ‘We have to re-start’,” Neville wrote on Twitter here
“I’d respect them more if they said, ‘We accept the increase in health risk but it’s one we are willing to take’. They won’t as they are frightened to death!”
When a Twitter user asked him what would happen if they restarted the season and someone died, Neville said: “That’s why we haven’t heard one single prominent CEO, Chairman, Owner or Executive open his mouth to back the re-start.
“Scared to death of the liability and blame.”
The clubs have reviewed plans for resuming training which will initially be restricted to small groups of players with no use of indoor facilities. Some clubs started individual sessions for players at their training grounds last week.
Neville said that although he understands the complexities of a return to action, it was “depressing” to see the league and clubs not communicating their plans.
“It would be good for them (the Premier League) to speak at least once. Any of them! Clubs included,” the former Manchester United and England defender added when it was suggested to him that the league has press briefings.
“They are bottling this virus on comms (communications). Very happy to tell us when they are delivering food parcels though.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gary Neville claims Premier League are ‘frightened’ to back season restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Neville has urged more clubs to speak out about Project Restart instead of briefing.
Gary Neville has criticised the Premier League and its clubs for failing to make the case for a return to action.
The former Manchester United and England defender accused them of being “frightened to death” to publicly back plans to restart the season for fear of being held liable should something go wrong.
Premier League clubs met on Friday to reaffirm their commitment to resuming the campaign and are understood to have earmarked June 8 as a best-case scenario to return following the coronavirus suspension.
But Neville feels there has been too much anonymous briefing and not enough public declarations.
Neville wrote on Twitter: “The PL are having a CV nightmare. They keep spouting Health First but then brief constantly “We have to Re-Start”. I’d respect them more if they said “We accept the increase in Health Risk but it’s one we are willing to take”. They won’t as they are frightened to death!”
When Neville was asked by a Twitter user what would happen if someone died as a result of the restart, he said: “That’s why we haven’t heard one single prominent CEO / Chairman / Owner or Executive open his mouth to back the re-start ! Brief / Brief / Brief ! Scared to death of the liability and blame.”
Before making an exception for Brighton as the “only club willing to take a stand”, Neville added: “It would be good for them to speak at least once. Any of them! Clubs included. They are bottling this virus on comms. Very Happy to tell us when they are delivering food parcels though.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Neville: PL clubs 'frightened' to publicly back restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gary Neville has accused Premier League clubs of being "frightened to death" to publicly back the plan to restart the season.
Premier League stakeholders met on Friday to debate how to finish the current campaign, with reports that some clubs want to abandon the season due to the pandemic and others are keen to play all remaining 92 fixtures.
Former Manchester United defender Neville believes clubs do not want to be held liable should a player become ill with the coronavirus if the English season resumes. The French and Dutch seasons have been called off because of the health crisis and while the Premier League have apparently ear-marked a June return, that date is far from set in stone.
Claiming there needs to be more public comment from clubs, Neville wrote on Twitter: "The PL are having a CV nightmare. They keep spouting Health First but then brief constantly 'We have to Re-Start'. I'd respect them more if they said 'We accept the increase in Health Risk but it's one we are willing to take'. They won't as they are frightened to death!"
When Neville was asked by a Twitter user what would happen if someone died as a result of the restart, he said: "That's why we haven't heard one single prominent CEO / Chairman / Owner or Executive open his mouth to back the re-start ! Brief / Brief / Brief ! Scared to death of the liability and blame."

"I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the 'new normal' might look for a lot of working environments," Parish wrote.
"Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis. In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?"

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The former Barcelona player is expected to return home on Monday.
Holland manager Ronald Koeman has undergone a heart procedure in Amsterdam after experiencing chest pain and is due to return home on Monday.
The 57-year-old, who managed Southampton and Everton in the Premier League before taking over his country almost two years ago, was taken to hospital on Sunday evening where he underwent cardiac catheterisation.
That involves the placement of a long, thin tube into a vein or artery and is typically performed without general anaesthetic.
A statement from the Dutch football association, the KNVB, read: “Ronald Koeman was hospitalised on Sunday evening after chest complaints. The 57-year-old national team coach of the Dutch national team has undergone a successful cardiac catheterisation and will return home tomorrow.
“We wish Ronald a lot of strength and improvement.”
A tweet from the governing body’s account added: “That is a shock. Fortunately things are going better again.”
Everton posted a message of support for the former Barcelona defender, tweeting: “Everyone at #EFC would like to wish former boss @RonaldKoeman a speedy recovery.”
France midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin, who played under Koeman for both the Toffees and the Saints was also quick to react.
“Prayers are with you! Stay strong @RonaldKoeman,” he wrote.
Holland and Liverpool midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum also added on Twitter: “Wishing you soon recovery coach.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dutch national coach Ronald Koeman required hospital treatment after suffering a heart problem, his wife told De Telegraaf newspaper on Sunday.
The 57-year-old underwent a "cardiac catheterisation" procedure at a hospital in Amsterdam after complaining of feeling unwell at his home.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Holland manager Ronald Koeman rushed to hospital with heart problem and has stent inserted after emergency operation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HOLLAND manager Ronald Koeman has been rushed to an Amsterdam hospital for an emergency heart operation.
The former Everton and Southampton boss had a stent inserted into his coronary vein after scans showed it was blocked.
Koeman's wife Bertina and his agent, Rob Jansen, confirmed to Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that the 57-year-old is in a stable condition.
The Ajax, PSV and Barcelona legend had to have a stent (a tube that keeps the blood vessel open) inserted after a cardiac catheterisation showed the vein was blocked.
He had been out cycling before complaining of chest pain - he was then taken in an ambulance to Amsterdam UMC hospital.
He is expected to be able to return home on Monday and there has been no suggestion so far that his heart problem was related to the coronavirus.
Koeman, who won eight league titles, two European Cups and Euro 88 as a player, was preparing his Netherlands side for Euro 2020 this summer before the Covid-19 crisis forced the tournament to be postponed a year.
All international matches have since been scrapped, with league across Europe awaiting the fait of their current campaigns.
The Dutch season was cancelled at the end of April, with the French league soon following.
At the moment, the Premier League plan to resume the season on June 12 and stage matches behind closed doors at neutral grounds - if the Government gives the green light.
Premier League clubs agreed during their video conference on Friday on a target date of May 18 to return to full training, with match days following three weeks later.
Players are set to be tested for Covid-19 twice a week, meaning the Premier League are planning on finding - and funding - over 10,000 tests between the start of training and the end of the season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Netherlands boss Ronald Koeman suffers heart attack</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ronald Koeman is recovering after he was rushed to hospital with heart problems.
Koeman, who is currently the manager of the Netherlands, underwent cardiac catheterization and is now believed to be recovering.
He was rushed to hospital by ambulance from his home town though doctors have now said that the former Barcelona star is stable.
Koeman had to have a stent placed in his vein as his coronary artery was blocked but there has been no suggestion his heart problem was coronavirus related.
Koeman had told Dutch media recently that he was taking regular bike rides to maintain his fitness during the coronavirus lockdown.
The 57-year-old is being treated at the Amsterdam University Medical Centre and his condition is not thought to be life-threatening.
The former Southampton and Everton boss had fallen ill at his home in Bussum, a town 20 miles outside Amsterdam, this afternoon.
Koeman took charge of the Netherlands in 2018 and led the country to the final of the inaugural Nations League last summer.
He had gone into management after a glittering playing career where he had turned out for the likes of Ajax and PSV Eindhoven as well as Barcelona.
His managing career has seen him take charge of European giants Benfica and Valencia as well as a spell in the Premier League with Everton and the Saints.
He is expected to return home on Monday following his procedure with Koeman having been planning for this summer’s Euro 2020.
That tournament has been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic and is now set to be played in the summer of 2021.
Koeman has helped Netherlands become one of the giants of world football again with the nation having missed out on the 2018 World Cup.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Netherlands head coach Ronald Koeman underwent successful heart surgery on Sunday.
Koeman, a Dutch great who starred for the Oranje from the early late 1980s and into the 1990s, was reportedly dealt with by specialists in Amsterdam.
According to De Telegraaf, Koeman was taken to the University Medical Centre (UMC) in the city and underwent treatment that involved unblocking a coronary artery and a stent being put into the vein.
De Telegraaf, which said it had its information confirmed by Koeman's wife Bartina and agent Rob Jansen, reported the 57-year-old was in a stable condition.
A statement issued by Jansen's Wasserman agency later confirmed his client had been operated on and would return home on Monday.
"Ronald Koeman was hospitalized tonight (Sunday evening) after chest complaints. The 57-year-old national team coach of the Dutch national team has undergone a successful cardiac catheterization and will return home tomorrow," it read.The Dutch football association (KNVB) posted a message of support on Twitter, stating: "That is a shock. Fortunately things are going better again. Much strength and improvement, coach."
Koeman enjoyed a stellar playing career at club level with Groningen, Ajax, PSV, Barcelona and Feyenoord, before turning to coaching.
He had spells in charge of Ajax, PSV, Benfica, Southampton, Feyenoord, Valencia and Everton, becoming Netherlands head coach in 2018.
Koeman led his country to second place at the inaugural Nations League Finals in 2019 and sealed qualification for Euro 2020, with the tournament since pushed back a year because of the coronavirus pandemic.

There has been no suggestion his heart problem was coronavirus related.
Koeman was preparing his Holland side for Euro 2020 this summer before the coronavirus crisis forced the tournament to be postponed a year.
As a player, Koeman featured for Barcelona between 1989 and 1995 where he appeared in 192 games scoring 67 goals.
He returned to the Camp Nou in 1998 to work as the assistant coach before he left in year 2000.
Fans of the club recently named him among the top 20 player ever to have played for the Catalan giants.
Meanwhile, Blaise Matuidi has opened up about his unusual behaviour after testing positive to the deadly coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Netherlands Manager Ronald Koeman in Hospital With Heart Problems</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Netherlands manager Ronald Koeman is reported to have been admitted to hospital with heart problems.
The 57-year-old has been in charge of the Dutch national side, who he represented 78 times as a player, since 2018, after his departure from Everton.
Dutch outlet De Telegraaf report that he was rushed via ambulance to the Amsterdam Medical Centre on Sunday afternoon, with what appears to have been cardiac problems.
He is said to have undergone 'cardiac catheterization' in the care of doctors, but is believed to be in 'stable' condition for the time being.
De Telegraaf say that the swift assistance of doctors and paramedics have contributed to a slight improvement in his condition, but it remains a worrying time for Koeman and his wife Bartina.
The Dutch publication note that the improvement in Koeman's condition means that he could be released from hospital as soon as Monday, but that will depend on how things go over the next few hours.
Koeman was set to lead a strong Netherlands side out at Euro 2020, but the tournament has been postponed until 2021 due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
An impressive qualifying campaign saw the Oranje lose just once - to Germany - and win six of their eight matches to storm to the finals, after disappointing in their failure to reach the 2018 World Cup.
Koeman is a celebrated figure in his native Holland, his tenure in the hotseat adding to a stellar playing career during which he marshalled a fearsome Dutch defence.
He helped Rinus Michels' famous side win the European Championships in 1988, and harboured hopes of repeating that success himself this summer before the Euros were postponed.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marcos Rojo breaks lockdown rules in Argentina as Man Utd star filmed smoking with friends</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo has flouted coronavirus lockdown rules in his native Argentina by smoking and playing poker with friends.
The 30-year-old, who moved on loan to Argentinian club Estudiantes in January, was filmed by his brother Franco surrounded by friends in a video which was quickly removed from Instagram - but not before Argentinian outlets were alerted to it.
Rojo spent eight years as a youth player with Estudiantes before breaking into the first-team with his boyhood club.
However, the former Sporting Lisbon man may be disciplined by the club after clearly breaking lockdown rules, which were extended by Argentinian president Alberto Fernandez until 10 May.
A mandatory quarantine has been in force in the South American country since mid-March. Though some restrictions were relaxed recently and people are allowed to go within 500 metres of their homes for exercise, visiting friends is still prohibited.
There have reportedly been 4,681 cases of coronavirus in Argentina and 241 people have died of the illness.
Franco Rojo also landed his brother in hot water only a day earlier when he posted a picture of Marcos playing football with friends in a park.
Controversially, Rojo was also wearing the shirt of Boca Juniors - Estudiantes' rivals - bearing the name of legendary Argentinian player Riquelme, who currently serves as Boca's vice-president.
However, Rojo has also been in the news for the right reasons during the lockdown after delivering food and drinks to over 200 families in his native La Plata in April.
Manchester United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is understood to be keen to offload Rojo this summer after the Argentine made only one Premier League start this season.
Rojo has only made one appearance in the Superliga since joining Estudiantes, but he did provide an assist in that match and is keen to extend his stay with the club.
"If it depends on me, I will speak to Manchester United's management about the possibility of staying here for another six months," Rojo said.
"I will feel a tremendous sense of pain if I have to leave after playing in so few matches."

The Argentine had been looking forward to taking part in the Copa Superliga, a 24-team tournament scheduled to end in a playoff in May, but the competition has been cancelled by the Argentine Football Association due to the coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United ace spotted breaking lockdown rules in deleted video</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo has been spotted breaking lockdown rules in Argentina.
In a video now deleted from Instagram, Rojo’s brother uploaded clips of the loaned-out Red Devils ace partying and playing cards with friends, according to the Daily Mail.
United won’t be too impressed by Rojo’s behaviour, with the Argentina international clearly not taking the rules on social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic seriously enough.
Thousands have died over the world in recent months and the evidence suggests that people staying at home can massively reduce the spread of the illness.
Rojo is currently on loan at Estudiantes after a difficult time at Man Utd, and one imagines his Old Trafford career was all but over anyway.
Still, it’s disappointing to see a footballer seemingly engage in activities like this when they have the platform to set a real example to others.
While Rojo himself might not be a person at particularly high risk of serious illness from coronavirus, he could easily spread it to someone who is if he continues to flout the rules.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo breaks Covid-19 lockdown rules in Argentina as he smokes and plays cards with friends in video uploaded to Instagram by his brother</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo has been filmed smoking while playing poker with friends in breach of the coronavirus lockdown in his native Argentina.
Rojo, currently on loan at Argentine club Estudiantes, was filmed by his brother Franco, who then uploaded the clip into his Instagram account. The video was quickly deleted but not before Argentine media outlets saw it.
The 30-year-old centre-back left Old Trafford to join his boyhood club during the January transfer window but this apparent breach of discipline could land him in hot water.
The gathering of friends around Rojo looks to be a breach of Argentina's lockdown rules, which were recently extended by president Alberto Fernandez until May 10.
A nationwide mandatory quarantine has been in place since the middle of March though some restrictions were relaxed - with people allowed to go within 500 metres of their home for exercise.
However, it doesn't permit visits from other people, certainly in the groups shown in the video. 
There have been almost 5,000 recorded cases of coronavirus in Argentina and 237 deaths as of this weekend.   
His brother also got Rojo into trouble a day earlier when he posted an Instagram image of them having a kickabout with friends in the park.
To compound matters, Rojo was wearing the shirt of Estudiantes' rivals Boca Juniors with the name and No 10 of legendary player Roman Riquelme on the back.
However, Rojo has also done some good during the lockdown, delivering food and drink to more than 200 families in his home town of La Plata last month.
Rojo was deemed surplus to requirements at Old Trafford by United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in January having started just one Premier League game all season.
He played just the one league game for Estudiantes prior to the shutdown of the Argentine league but had already expressed his wish for the loan to be extended.
Rojo said: 'If it depends on me, I will speak to Manchester United's management about the possibility of staying here for another six months.
'I will feel a tremendous sense of pain if I have to leave after playing in so few matches.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man Utd player breaks lockdown rules as he smokes and plays cards with pals</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo – who is currently on loan at Estudiantes – appears to have broken coronavirus lockdown rules on multiple occasions in his native Argentina.
The defender, who returned to Buenos Aires during the January transfer window, was seen smoking and playing cards with a group of friends in a video uploaded to Instagram by his brother, Franco, on Saturday night.
Although the clip was quickly deleted, it was shared across social media with many supporters slamming Rojo’s behaviour as he flaunted social distancing guidelines.
Argentina President Alberto Fernandez recently extended the country’s coronavirus lockdown until May 10, with the nationwide mandatory quarantine having been in place since the middle of March.
Although some restrictions were relaxed – with people allowed to go out daily for recreational purposes within a 500-metre radius of their home – that has not been extended to visiting groups of people.
But Rojo appeared to disregard those rules, with at least 11 people spotted in the video his brother uploaded to his Instagram stories.
A day earlier he had also courted controversy when he had a kickabout with friends in the park, with the image again uploaded to Instagram by his brother.
To make matters worse, the Estudiantes loanee was wearing the shirt of rival club Boca Juniors, with legendary player Juan Roman Riquelme’s name on the back, and supporters have called on club president Juan Sebastian Veron to reprimand Rojo.
Despite his recent indiscretions, the 30-year-old has been keen to do his bit during the pandemic and distributed food and drink to more than 200 families in his hometown of La Plata last month.
‘It was a pleasure to do something small locally to me to help in this unfortunate struggle the world is going through,’ he said. ‘Of course, we took the necessary precautions using masks and gloves to protect ourselves and others.
‘My neighbourhood is a humble place but it’s a very friendly place and I am proud to call it home. The community spirit during this crisis has been really uplifting.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cycling: Froome fears Tour de France may struggle to keep fans away</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: Chris Froome fears Tour de France organisers could struggle to prevent fans gathering to watch the race even if it is not open to the public because of the coronavirus.
The Tour de France has been rescheduled for Aug 29 from its original Jun 27 start date, but there are still concerns about how to organise the event amid the pandemic.
The French government says no mass gatherings can take place before September, but has clarified the Tour could still go ahead on its new dates if the opening stages are managed correctly.
However, Team Ineos rider Froome, a four-time Tour de France winner, believes it will be hard to control whether crowds turn up.
"For sure we can put the race on without people standing on the roads and fans in that sense," Froome told former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen on an Instagram Live chat.

Froome, 34, missed last year's Tour de France after suffering serious injuries in a crash.
He has been hitting the gym every day during lockdown to try and replicate what he would be doing this time of the year in preparation for the Tour.
"Some days I'm even doing up to six hours sitting on the stationary trainer - big days," he said.
"Obviously I'm coming off the back of a big injury now as well.
"A lot of the training I've been doing up until this point has been indoors already, so it's almost prepared me in a way for this whole lockdown period."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chris Froome fears Tour de France organisers could struggle to prevent fans gathering to watch the race even if it is not open to the public because of the coronavirus.
The Tour de France has been rescheduled for 29 August from its original 27 June  start date, but there are still concerns about how to organise the event amid the pandemic.
The French government says no mass gatherings can take place before September, but has clarified the Tour could still go ahead on its new dates if the opening stages are managed correctly.
However, Team Ineos rider Froome, a four-time Tour de France winner, believes it will be hard to control whether crowds turn up.
"For sure we can put the race on without people standing on the roads and fans in that sense," Froome told former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen on an Instagram Live chat.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tour de France: Chris Froome doubts spectators will stay away</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chris Froome believes the Tour de France can work without spectators but has questioned how organisers can prevent large crowds converging along the route.
Initially due to start on June 27, the coronavirus pandemic has seen the Tour pushed back until August 29 and doubts remain given the differing Covid-19 situations across the world.
The French government says no mass gatherings can take place before September, but have clarified the Tour could still go ahead on its new dates if the opening stages are managed correctly.
That is one of the main things four-time champion Froome believes will be hard to manage as he continues to prepare for a tilt at another victory.
"For sure we can put the race on without people standing on the roads and fans in that sense," the Team Ineos rider said.
"I mean, we can put on the race and it can be broadcast on television. You're not going to get the same scenes as you would get going through these tunnels of just people everywhere and all the rest of it.
"Maybe that's the version of race we need to see this year. I don't know.
"In theory, we can put the race on but I think the bigger question is would the organisers be able to keep people from actually coming out and gathering in large crowds? I think that's the bigger question."
The 34-year-old missed last year's race after suffering career-threatening injuries in a crash and made his first racing comeback at the UAE Tour in February after eight months away.
The British rider has been hitting the gym first thing every day to try and replicate what he would be doing this time of the year in preparation for the Tour.
"Some days I'm even doing up to six hours sitting on the stationary trainer - big days," he told former cricketer Kevin Pietersen on an Instagram Live.
"It gets pretty boring at times. I've been through every playlist I own about 10 times each.
"But, yeah, just getting through it and doing the best I can. Obviously I'm coming off the back of a big injury now as well.
"I mean, a lot of the training I've been doing up until this point has been indoors already, so it's almost prepared me in a way for this whole lockdown period and I think mentally I'm obviously able to get through it a bit easier."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cycling: European championships postponed by a year - UEC</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS (Reuters) - The road cycling European championships scheduled for September in the Italian province of Trentino have been postponed by a year amid the COVID-19 crisis, the Union Europeenne de Cyclisme (UEC) said on Saturday.
“Due to the difficult situation affecting the whole world... the European Road Championships in Trentino (Italy) from 9 to 13 September will be postponed to 2021 and will be held in the same city,” the UEC wrote in a statement.
With elite racing suspended until Aug. 1, the sport’s flagship race, the Tour de France, was moved to Aug. 29-Sept 20.
The UEC, however, said it would “look at the various alternatives for the 2020 European Road Championships and UEC calendar events this season so that all titles in each category can be awarded in all disciplines”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">European Road Cycling Championships postponed until 2021</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The European Road Cycling Championships, which were due to take place in the Italian province of Trentino, have been postponed until next year.
The UCI has pushed back the event, which was set to be held in September because of the coronavirus pandemic and have confirmed that Italy will retain staging rights for the rescheduled race in 2021.
"Due to the difficult situation affecting the whole world, the Union Europeenne de Cyclisme must announce that the European Road Championships in Trentino (Italy) from 9 to 13 September will be postponed to 2021 and will be held in the same city," the European Cycling Union (UEC) announced in a statement.
"The dates between the options requested (1-5 September 2021 or 8-12 September 2021) will be announced in the next few months by the Union Cycliste Internationale when it publishes the 2021 calendar."
They added that they'll "look at the various alternatives for the 2020 European Road Championships and UEC calendar events this season so that all titles in each category can be awarded in all disciplines".
Vuelta a Espana organisers have already decided to cancel their planned start in the Netherlands and have reduced the Grand Tour event to just 18 stages.
The Tour de France has been pushed back until the 29th of August while the Giro d'Italia has also been pushed back to later in the season.

Cologne’s players are continuing to train despite the three positive tests for coronavirus at the club that have unsettled the German soccer league’s restart plans.
Cologne said Friday that three people had tested positive but didn’t name them or say whether they were players, who are currently training in small groups.
“The experts evaluate it as such that, due to the hygiene and infection prevention measures in group training, we can continue to train with those who tested negatively as we had been,” team doctor Paul Klein said on the club website Saturday.
Klein added no-one at the club was considered “category one” in respect of the three individuals who gave samples Thursday. That is typically someone who either lives with an infected person or had close contact with them.

Formula One hopes to finally start the season with a double-header in the naturally isolated environment around the venue for the Austrian Grand Prix.
Despite the first 10 races having been canceled or postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, the targeted start date is July 5 in Austria. F1 still envisages holding 15 to 18 of the 22 scheduled Grands Prix.
One way to make up for lost time is having consecutive weekends on one circuit, like the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg. F1 manager director of motorsports Ross Brawn says this is a “real consideration” so long as iron-tight safety regulations are met.
“One of the logistical challenges is getting everyone tested and cleared to enter the racing environment,” he told an official F1 podcast. “We can contain everyone within that environment, and therefore once we are there it is appealing to have another race the following week.”
The Red Bull Ring’s location in the Styrian mountains makes it naturally isolated.

The 20 English Premier League clubs all want to complete the season but there are also a lot of obstacles to overcome, West Ham vice chair Karren Brady said on Saturday.
The clubs were presented with the league’s “Project Restart” plans at a meeting on Friday and were told that the remaining 92 matches of a 2019-20 season halted by the coronavirus pandemic must be played behind closed doors at eight to 10 neutral stadiums, which could prove a major sticking point.
“At yesterday’s meeting every club said it wants the season to restart,” Brady told the Sun newspaper. “We all know it is going to take a lot of working together, good faith, careful thought and compromises if we have any chance of that happening.
“The only common theme from all the clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game. Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again. There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
"Project Restart" has June 8 as the potential earliest date for matches.

The Australian government has given the New Zealand Warriors permission to travel to Australia and train during a 14-day isolation period due to the coronavirus pandemic, improving the National Rugby League’s chances of resuming the season on May 28.
Two rounds were played before the season was suspended on March 23 due to the pandemic. Australian media reported Saturday that the NRL plans a 20-round season in a revised schedule with the grand final championship to be played on Oct. 25.
The match venues have not been determined, although they are all expected to be played in New South Wales state.

Ehrlich told The Detroit News that Patterson was "wading through the process ... making sure it was a good fit."
"It took a little bit longer, but now he's got a home," he told the newspaper.
Patterson and Ta'amu were teammates in 2017 at Ole Miss, a year before Patterson transferred to Michigan.
Patterson threw for 8,800 yards in his four collegiate seasons, two at Ole Miss and two at Michigan, with 68 touchdown passes and 27 interceptions. He threw for 3,061 yards with 23 TDs and eight interceptions for the Wolverines in 2019.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Kansas City Chiefs have agreed to a contract with defensive end Taco Charlton, adding a former first-round pick who flamed out in Dallas and Miami but whose athleticism is a perfect match for coordinator Steve Spagnuolo’s defense.
The 25-year-old Charlton was the 28th overall selection in the 2017 draft. He made seven starts for the Cowboys before sustaining a shoulder injury, and he was waived just two weeks into last season. The Dolphins signed Charlton and he made five starts and appeared in 10 games, but he was a healthy scratch the last four games of the regular season.
The Dolphins waived him Thursday, and the Chiefs were able to sign him when he cleared waivers Friday.
Charlton will compete for playing time within a rotation that includes starting defensive ends Frank Clark and Alex Okafor, backups Tanoh Kpassagnon and Breeland Speaks, and fifth-round draft pick Mike Danna.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Cowboys First-Round Pick Reportedly Signs With New NFL Team</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Late Friday night, a former first-round pick of the Dallas Cowboys reportedly inked a deal with a new NFL team.
Earlier this week, the Miami Dolphins released defensive end Taco Charlton. He was a first-round pick of the Cowboys in 2017, but he fell out of favor after two mediocre seasons in Dallas.
After getting cut by the Dolphins earlier this week, it didn’t take him long to find a new landing spot. According to a new report, Charlton is staying in the AFC and joining a contender.
The former Michigan star reportedly agreed to a deal with the Kansas City Chiefs. According to Yahoo Sports insider Terez Paylor, the Chiefs signed Charlton to a one-year contract.
In 10 games in Miami (five starts), Charlton recorded 21 tackles, a career-high five sacks and two forced fumbles.
The former first-round pick had his best NFL season with the Dolphins, but even the 2019 campaign didn’t come without a few hiccups.
He was a healthy scratch multiple times during the last few weeks of the season, despite his success on the field. That signified the writing on the wall for the former Wolverines pass rusher.
Now he gets a fresh start with the Super Bowl-winning Kansas City Chiefs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Jaguars reportedly decline Leonard Fournette's fifth-year option</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In the latest indication that Leonard Fournette's time with the Jacksonville Jaguars is nearing an end, the team reportedly declined to pick up the fifth-year option on the running back's rookie contract.
Fournette, the fourth overall selection in the 2017 NFL Draft, is entering the final year of the contract and is due to make $4.17 million in 2020.
NFL FREE AGENTS: Best available players at each position
With his option declined, as per NFL Network, Fournette will become an unrestricted free agent following the conclusion of the 2020-21 league year.
The Jaguars reportedly attempted to trade Fournette over the past month and the organization had discussions with the Buccaneers and Dolphins, but they were unable to complete a deal.
After a disappointing 2018 during which he played in only eight games and ran for439 yards, Fournette rebounded with a career season in 2019. He rushed for 1,152 yards and had a team-best 76 receptions in 15 games while totaling 1,674 yards from scrimmage to rank sixth in the NFL.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football: Pogba using lockdown to prepare for return after injury woes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is using the coronavirus lockdown to step up his return to fitness after an injury-plagued season.
Pogba had made just eight appearances for United this season before the health crisis forced the suspension of the Premier League in March.
The French World Cup winner hasn't played a single match in 2020 due to his persistent ankle problems.
His last appearance came in a Dec 26 win over Newcastle, but Pogba has been keeping fit during the virus break and hopes to be ready if the Premier League can return in the summer.
"I have a little home gym in my house," Pogba told United's website.
"I can do some training, some running, some bike, go outside and do some things with the ball. I am just keeping busy and keeping healthy.
"We have got to stay motivated, there is no other choice. It is a period and we don't know until when it will be like this, but I still have goals in my head and one day hopefully this (pandemic) will stop.
"And then we have to get back on the pitch, so we have to be ready.
"For myself, I have been out for a long time as well, so for me I just want to come back playing football."
Pogba, 27, has been in regular contact with his United team-mates during the lockdown as they follow the club's fitness regime from home.
Linked with a move away from fifth-placed United earlier this season, Pogba's presence would boost their bid for Champions League qualification if matches can be played again eventually.
"My advice first of all is to stay safe, stay at home and keep practising," Pogba said.
"There is always a way to work, you can work with anything you have at home, you can still do sit-ups, push-ups."

For injured players like Pogba, the wait has been even longer. The 27-year-old has managed just eight appearances during an injury-hit season and has yet to feature in 2020 due to an ankle issue.
“I have a little home gym in my house,” Pogba, who is isolating in the north west, said.
“I can do some training, some running, some bike, go outside and do some things with the ball. I am just keeping busy and keeping healthy.
“We have got to stay motivated, there is no other choice. It is a period and we don’t know until when it will be like this, but I still have goals in my head and one day hopefully this (pandemic) will stop. And then we have to get back on the pitch, so we have to be ready.
“For myself, I have been out for a long time as well, so for me I just want to come back playing football.”
Pogba has been in regular contact with his team-mates during the lockdown as they continue to the put the work in amid this unusual backdrop.
“My advice first of all is to stay safe, stay at home and keep practising,” he told the club’s website.
“There is always a way to work, you can work with anything you have at home, you can still do sit-ups, push-ups.
“For abdominals and core work, you don’t need weights and stuff like that. You just need the work.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul Pogba provides new Manchester United injury update</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul Pogba has revealed he is working hard on his fitness to be ready for when football makes a return.
The Manchester United midfielder has missed big chunks of the season with separate ankle injuries, the second of which required surgery in January. His last United appearance came on Boxing Day against Newcastle, but Pogba hasn't started a game for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side since September.
But with football currently on hold as the nation implements social distancing rules to limit the coronavirus pandemic, Pogba is working on his fitness and football skills alone.
He is confident of being fit and ready to play a key role for United when the Premier League is back.
“I have a little home gym in my house,“ Pogba told United's official website. ”I can do some training, some running, some bike, go outside and do some things with the ball. I am just keeping busy and keeping healthy. “We have got to stay motivated, there is no other choice. It is a period and we don't know until when it will be like this, but I still have goals in my head and one day hopefully this [pandemic] will stop. “And then we have to get back on the pitch, so we have to be ready. For myself, I have been out for a long time as well, so for me I just want to come back playing football.”
Pogba also gave some fitness advice to those trying to stay in shape from home during the lockdown, with gyms around the country all closed at the time of writing.
“My advice first of all is to stay safe, stay at home and keep practising,” he added. “There is always a way to work, you can work with anything you have at home, you can still do sit-ups, push-ups. “For abdominals and core work, you don't need weights and stuff like that. You just need the work.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pogba using lockdown to prepare for return from injury</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is using the coronavirus lockdown to step up his return to fitness after an injury-plagued season.
Pogbahad made just eight appearances for United this season before the health crisis forced the suspension of the Premier League in March.
The French World Cup winner hasn't played a single match in 2020 due to his persistent ankle problems. His last appearance came in a December 26 win over Newcastle, but Pogba has been keeping fit during the virus break and hopes to be ready if the Premier League can return in the summer.
"I have a little home gym in my house," Pogba told United's website. "I can do some training, some running, some bike, go outside and do some things with the ball. I am just keeping busy and keeping healthy. We have got to stay motivated, there is no other choice. It is a period and we don't know until when it will be like this, but I still have goals in my head and one day hopefully this (pandemic) will stop.

"And then we have to get back on the pitch, so we have to be ready. For myself, I have been out for a long time as well, so for me I just want to come back playing football."
Pogba, 27, has been in regular contact with his United team-mates during the lockdown as they follow the club's fitness regime from home. Linked with a move away from fifth-placed United earlier this season, Pogba's presence would boost their bid for Champions League qualification if matches can be played again eventually.
"My advice first of all is to stay safe, stay at home and keep practising," Pogba said. "There is always a way to work, you can work with anything you have at home, you can still do sit-ups, push-ups."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Athletics: Duplantis, Lavillenie settle for tie in garden pole vault challenge</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Former Olympic pole vault champion Renaud Lavillenie of France and Sweden’s world record holder Mondo Duplantis shared the spoils in the Ultimate Garden Clash, despite competing in locations 8,000km apart during the COVID-19 lockdown.
Along with American Sam Kendricks, the trio attempted to vault 5m as many times as they could in 30 minutes in a format they devised together, connected via a live video link streamed to fans on the social media channels of World Athletics.
Kendricks attempted the challenge in Oxford, Mississippi, Duplantis was based in Lafayette, Louisiana while Lavillenie competed in his back garden in Clermont-Ferrand, France.
Duplantis took an early lead before Lavillenie caught up while Kendricks tried to pace himself. By the end of 30 minutes, Lavillenie and Duplantis had both cleared the height 36 times while Kendricks only managed 26.
“I’m done, I don’t want to take any risks. I’ll share the gold with Mondo,” Lavillenie said. “I was really missing the feeling I get competing.
“It’s crazy but even doing this in my garden, I get the same feeling I’d get at a major championships. It was very exciting and I’m very happy to be a part of it. I’m not going to do it every week, but I’m happy to do it once a year.”
Duplantis, who set the world record mark of 6.18m earlier this year, wanted to go on for three more minutes to break the tie but eventually decided to settle for the shared victory with the two-times Olympic medallist.
“It was really fun being out there competing against those guys,” Duplantis said. “I had really missed competing. I didn’t think it was going to end in a tie, but that’s sports.”
World Athletics president Sebastian Coe lauded the initiative and said he hoped there would be more such events during the lockdown.
The global governing body said they were exploring the possibility of holding similar events in the future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pole vault event held in competitors' backyards</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">French pole vaulter Renaud Lavillenie hardly treated this like a garden-variety competition.
It was for backyard bragging rights. So he raised his intensity.
Lavillenie and Mondo Duplantis of Sweden shared the gold medal Sunday during a men's pole vault competition held in their own yards. Advertised as the "Ultimate Garden Clash,'' it was a rare sporting event contested during the coronavirus pandemic.
Duplantis, a world record-holder, and Lavillenie, the 2012 Olympic champion, each cleared a height of 16 feet (4.9 meters) 36 times over a span of 30 minutes that was broadcast by World Athletics on its social media channels. Both had one miss. Sam Kendricks of the United States got the bronze by clearing the bar 26 times in a competition featuring three of the event's biggest names.
It just might have been a preview of the Tokyo Games, which have been postponed to 2021. Lavillenie certainly took his concentration to another level.
"It's crazy, but even doing this in my garden, I get the same feeling I'd get at a major championships," Lavillenie said. "It was very exciting, and I'm very happy to be a part of it.''
They tried to figure out a tiebreaker before electing to share the gold. Duplantis, 20, initially pushed for a three-minute playoffs format that was on the table, while Lavillenie, 33, nixed the plan. He was exhausted.
Lavillenie did vault over his 36th successful bar just ahead of Duplantis. The event was split into two 15-minute sessions with a short halftime.
"I will give you a rematch, Mondo,'' he playfully said at the end.
The backyard idea was brought forth by Lavillenie, and the trio collaborated on the unique competition format because adjusting the bar wasn't practical without officials in place.
Duplantis competed from his base in Lafayette, Louisiana, with his setup next to a garden wall. Kendricks was at his farm in Oxford, Mississippi, with his landing mat nestled between trees and near a fence where a horse occasionally was caught on the video feed.
Then there was Lavillenie, who took part from Clermont-Ferrand, France. The family's trampoline was pushed to the side and there was a swingset in the background.
Don't expect this to be a new pole-vaulting format, though. This was only for show.
"I want to jump high,'' said Duplantis, the American-born vaulter who represents Sweden and broke Lavillenie's world record in February. "I want to jump a little higher.''
Still, it made for entertaining theater.
"The general sense of this competition was just supposed to be fun,'' said Kendricks, the two-time world champion. "A way to eat up time on a Sunday and give a chance for everybody to watch.''
Among those watching was World Athletics president Sebastian Coe, who gave the competition high marks.
"This is a brilliant initiative, great fun and really innovative,'' Coe said in a statement. "My thanks go to them, their families and the World Athletics team for bringing live athletics back during lockdown. I hope we can bring a few more events like this to bring to all athletics fans out there.''
It's already a hit among those in the track and field community.
"I love this idea so much,'' 200-meter world champion sprinter Noah Lyles posted in a social media chat room for the event. "It's such a great new way to compete.''
Duplantis, Lavillenie and Kendricks treated it almost like a track meet as they tried to average a jump per minute. The routine was simple: Vault, walk back with the pole, take a very quick breather -- maybe a sip of water -- and vault again.
Above all else, it was competition again. The outbreak of COVID-19 has the track and field season on hold.
"I miss the feeling of competing," Duplantis said. "I miss the feeling of being out there with the guys. It was a really fun time. It was fun to get back into the competition gear again.''

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pole vault kings Duplantis, Lavillenie tie in back garden competition</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Three of the best pole vaulters of all time went head-to-head in a competition on Sunday from their back gardens, as sport continued to find new ways of taking place despite the coronavirus pandemic.
World record holder Armand Duplantis and former Olympic champion Renaud Lavillenie cleared five metres 36 times in half an hour, while world champion Sam Kendricks managed 26 successful attempts.
The event, livestreamed by World Athletics on social media and watched by around 20 000 people, saw Lavillenie competing from his home in Clermont-Ferrand, France, with Swedish star Duplantis in Lafayette, Louisiana and Kendricks in Oxford, Mississippi.
The 20-year-old Duplantis wanted an extra three minutes to decide a winner, but Lavillenie, 33, said he was "done".
"I was really missing the feeling I get competing," said Frenchman Lavillenie.
"It's crazy but even doing this in my garden, I get the same feeling I'd get at a major championships. It was very exciting and I'm very happy to be a part of it.
"I'm not going to do it every week, but I'm happy to do it once a year."
Duplantis, who replaced Lavillenie as world record holder, let a halfway lead slip with a rare missed effort.
"It was really fun being out there competing against those guys," he said.
"I had really missed competing."
World Athletics said it would look into holding more "Ultimate Garden Clashes" in the coming weeks, with much of the world still under lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
"This is a brilliant initiative, great fun and really innovative," said World Athletics president Sebastian Coe.
"My thanks go to them, their families and the World Athletics team for bringing live athletics back during lockdown."
Lavillenie and Duplantis will face off again remotely in Oslo on 11 June, with the Swede competing at the Bislett Stadium.
The event replaces the traditional Diamond League competition, and will also feature a world-record attempt by Norwegian hurdles star Karsten Warholm.
Earlier this week, the Lausanne Diamond League meeting organisers said they were looking at "other options" after announcing it would not be able to take place as planned on 20 August.
Duplantis, who set a new world record of 6.18m in February, was the favourite to claim the Olympic title this year before the Tokyo Games were postponed until 2021.
Brazil's Thiago Braz da Silva is the reigning men's Olympic pole vault champion after triumphing in front of his home fans in Rio de Janeiro four years ago.

Former Olympic gold medallist Lavillenie, world record holder Duplantis and reigning world champion Sam Kendricks signed up for the three-way challenge set up by World Athletics in a bid to fill the vacuum of elite competition.
The trio had two 15-minute rounds, split by a five-minute break, to clear a five-metre bar as many times as possible in their own gardens, with Lavillenie and Duplantis both level on 36 clearances.
Kendricks boasted the only 100 per cent record but was left behind on 26.
The idea of a three-minute ‘jump off’ was mooted to break the tie but Lavillenie, jumping at home in Clermont-Ferrand, was offered the chance to decide having completed his final effort marginally quicker.
Visibly exhausted he opted to split the honour with his rival, noting with a smile: “We can share it, but I am the first winner and Mondo (Duplantis) is the second winner!”
Louisiana-based Duplantis, the younger man by 13 years, was eager to go again but ultimately accepted his share of the spoils, adding “let’s share more sport like this, it’s fun.”

They tried to figure out a tiebreaker before electing to share the gold. The 20-year-old Duplantis initially pushed for a three-minute playoffs format that was on the table, while the 33-year-old Lavillenie nixed the plan. He was exhausted.
Lavillenie did vault over his 36th successful bar just ahead of Duplantis. The event was split into two 15-minute sessions with a short halftime.
“I will give you a rematch, Mondo,” he playfully said at the end.
The backyard idea was brought forth by Lavillenie, and the trio collaborated on the unique competition format because adjusting the bar wasn’t practical without officials in place.
Duplantis competed from his base in Lafayette, Louisiana, with his setup next to a garden wall. Kendricks was at his farm in Oxford, Mississippi, with his landing mat nestled between trees and near a fence where a horse occasionally was caught on the video feed.
Then there was Lavillenie, who took part from Clermont-Ferrand, France. The family’s trampoline was pushed to the side and there was a swingset in the background.

Don’t expect this to be a new pole-vaulting format, though. This was only for show.
“I want to jump high,” said Duplantis, the American-born vaulter who represents Sweden and broke Lavillenie’s world record in February. “I want to jump a little higher.”
Still, it made for entertaining theater.
“The general sense of this competition was just supposed to be fun,” said Kendricks, the two-time world champion. “A way to eat up time on a Sunday and give a chance for everybody to watch.”
Among those watching was World Athletics President Sebastian Coe, who gave the competition high marks.
“This is a brilliant initiative, great fun and really innovative,” Coe said in a statement. “My thanks go to them, their families and the World Athletics team for bringing live athletics back during lockdown. I hope we can bring a few more events like this to bring to all athletics fans out there.”
It’s already a hit among those in the track and field community.
“I love this idea so much,” 200-meter world champion sprinter Noah Lyles posted in a social media chat room for the event. “It’s such a great new way to compete.”
Duplantis, Lavillenie and Kendricks treated it almost like a track meet as they tried to average a jump per minute. The routine was simple: Vault, walk back with the pole, take a very quick breather — maybe a sip of water — and vault again.
Above all else, it was competition again. The outbreak of COVID-19 has the track and field season on hold.
“I miss the feeling of competing,” Duplantis said. “I miss the feeling of being out there with the guys. It was a really fun time. It was fun to get back into the competition gear again.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pole vault rivals share the spoils in 'Ultimate Garden Clash'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Olympic gold medallist Lavillenie, world record holder Duplantis and reigning world champion Sam Kendricks signed up for the three-way challenge set up by World Athletics in a bid to fill the vacuum of elite competition.
The trio had two 15-minute rounds, split by a five-minute break, to clear a five-metre bar as many times as possible in their own gardens, with Lavillenie and Duplantis both level on 36 clearances.
Kendricks boasted the only 100 per cent record but was left behind on 26.
The idea of a three-minute 'jump off' was mooted to break the tie but Lavillenie, jumping at home in Clermont-Ferrand, was offered the chance to decide having completed his final effort marginally quicker.
Visibly exhausted he opted to split the honour with his rival, noting with a smile: "We can share it, but I am the first winner and Mondo (Duplantis) is the second winner!"
Louisiana-based Duplantis, the younger man by 13 years, was eager to go again but ultimately accepted his share of the spoils, adding "let's share more sport like this, it's fun."

    <h5 class="mb-1">The Latest: Pole vaulters set bar in competition from homes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Latest on the effects of the new coronavirus outbreak on sports around the world:
Mondo Duplantis of Sweden and Renaud Lavillenie of France tied for the gold medal Sunday during a men’s pole vault competition held in their own backyards. It was a rare sporting event held during the coronavirus pandemic.
Duplantis and Lavillenie each cleared a height of 5 meters (16 feet) 36 times over a span of 30 minutes that was broadcast by World Athletics on its social media channels. Both had one miss. Sam Kendricks of the United States wound up third by clearing the bar 26 times.
They tried to figure out a tiebreaker before electing to award double gold. The 20-year-old Duplantis initially pushed for a three-minute playoffs, while the 33-year-old Lavillenie nixed the plan.
Lavillenie did clear his 36th bar seconds before Duplantis. The event was split into two 15-minute sessions with a short halftime.
The trio collaborated on the unique competition format since adjusting the bar wasn’t practical without officials in place.
Duplantis competed from his base in Lafayette, Louisiana. Kendricks was at his farm in Oxford, Mississippi, and Lavillenie took part from Clermont-Ferrand, France, as he pushed the family’s trampoline to the side in order to jump.
It was billed as the “Ultimate Garden Clash” and could be a model for future track events. The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to the Tokyo Olympics being moved to 2021, along with the track and field season being put on hold.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Current situation is like Test match on dangerous wicket: Ganguly on COVID-19 pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: BCCI president Sourav Ganguly is deeply saddened and intimidated by the devastation caused because of the COVID-19 pandemic and has equated the unprecedented crisis to playing a Test match on a dangerous wicket.
The decorated former player opened up on life under lockdown due to the novel coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 2.40 lakh lives across the world while infecting more than 34 lakh people.
"This situation is a Test match on a very dangerous wicket. The ball is seaming and spinning as well - the batsman has very little margin of error," Ganguly said while speaking on '100 Hours 100 Stars', an initiative started by Fever Network.
"So, the batsman has to score runs and keep his wicket safe with this little margin of error, and win this Test match," he added.
A winner of innumerable fierce battles during his playing days when there was no dearth of fearsome fast bowlers and quality spinners, Ganguly was tempted to draw a parallel between the tough moments in the sport and the health crisis.
"This is very difficult, but we hope that we will win this match together," he added.
Ganguly expressed his sadness at the number of lives lost in the pandemic and the irreparable damage that it has caused.
"I am really upset seeing the current situation, because so many people are suffering outside. We are still struggling to understand how to stop this pandemic," he said.
"This atmosphere all over the world has really bothered me. We don't know how, when and where it came from - we all were unprepared for this," he added.
Not just upset, Ganguly conceded he cannot help feeling a big scared of what's unfolding because of the disease.
"People are being affected by this so much. There have been so many deaths. This situation upsets me, and I also feel scared," he said.
"People come to my house to deliver groceries, food, so I feel a little scared as well. So it's a mixed feeling. I just want this to end as quickly as possible," he added, He said cricket has taught him to face tough situations in life and the importance of staying alert at all times.
Asked how he keeps himself positive, the former captain said: "Cricket has taught me a lot. I faced real life, high-pressure situations. You have to make runs and there is just one ball left. 
"If you make one wrong move, one wrong footwork, you will not get another chance. These kind of situations make you alert and aware about real life situations," he said.
The BCCI chief, though, also added that he is getting to spend a lot of time with his family after a long time.
"It's been a month into the lockdown. I didn't mind it earlier. Earlier, I wouldn't get time at home like this. My lifestyle involved travelling for work everyday.
"For the past 30-32 days, I have been at home with my family, spending time with my wife, daughter, my mother and my brother.
"I have got a time like this after long, so I am enjoying myself," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Current situation is like Test match on dangerous wicket, Sourav Ganguly says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) President Sourav Ganguly is deeply saddened and intimidated by the devastation caused because of the Covid-19 pandemic and has equated the unprecedented crisis to playing a Test match on a dangerous wicket.
The decorated former player opened up on life under lockdown due to the novel coronavirus pandemic that has claimed over 2.40 lakh lives across the world while infecting more than 34 lakh people.
“This situation is a Test match on a very dangerous wicket. The ball is seaming and spinning as well — the batsman has very little margin of error,” Ganguly said while speaking on ‘100 Hours 100 Stars’, an initiative started by Fever Network.
“So, the batsman has to score runs and keep his wicket safe with this little margin of error, and win this Test match,” he added.
A winner of innumerable fierce battles during his playing days when there was no dearth of fearsome fast bowlers and quality spinners, Ganguly was tempted to draw a parallel between the tough moments in the sport and the health crisis.
“This is very difficult, but we hope that we will win this match together,” he added.
Ganguly expressed his sadness at the number of lives lost in the pandemic and the irreparable damage that it has caused.
“I am really upset seeing the current situation, because so many people are suffering outside. We are still struggling to understand how to stop this pandemic,” he said.
“This atmosphere all over the world has really bothered me. We don’t know how, when and where it came from — we all were unprepared for this,” he added.
Not just upset, Ganguly conceded he cannot help feeling a bit scared of what’s unfolding because of the disease.
“People are being affected by this so much. There have been so many deaths. This situation upsets me, and I also feel scared,” he said.
“People come to my house to deliver groceries, food, so I feel a little scared as well. So it’s a mixed feeling. I just want this to end as quickly as possible,” he added,
He said cricket has taught him to face tough situations in life and the importance of staying alert at all times.
Asked how he keeps himself positive, the former captain said: “Cricket has taught me a lot. I faced real life, high-pressure situations. You have to make runs and there is just one ball left.
“If you make one wrong move, one wrong footwork, you will not get another chance. These kind of situations make you alert and aware about real life situations,” he said.
The BCCI chief, though, also added that he is getting to spend a lot of time with his family after a long time.
“It’s been a month into the lockdown. I didn’t mind it. Earlier, I wouldn’t get time at home like this. My lifestyle involved travelling for work everyday.
“For the past 30-32 days, I have been at home with my family, spending time with my wife, daughter, my mother and my brother.
“I have got a time like this after long, so I am enjoying myself,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How the Cowboys are adding depth, not leverage, with Andy Dalton</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Here’s what the addition of Andy Dalton to the Dallas Cowboys is not: a sign of unhappiness with negotiations with quarterback Dak Prescott and a way to leverage a long-term deal.
The addition of the former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback is about making the roster better.
By adding Dalton, the Cowboys might have the best backup quarterback in the NFL.
At 32, he has thrown 204 touchdown passes. He has 31,954 passing yards. He has been to the playoffs. He has won big games.
If something were to happen to Prescott, who has yet to miss a game in his career, the Cowboys have a known commodity in Dalton, who wanted to come to the Cowboys in part because of the uncertainty created by the coronavirus pandemic. He lives in Dallas, so it makes sense even if he had a better opportunity elsewhere.
According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Dalton’s deal is worth $3 million and could grow to $7 million.
Cooper Rush, who has served as Prescott’s backup the past three seasons and thrown three passes, is set to make $2.1 million.
This is how the Cowboys used to treat the backup spot when Tony Romo was the starting quarterback.
In 2007-08, they had Brad Johnson as Romo’s No. 2, and he made $5.5 million. From 2009 to '11, it was Jon Kitna, and he made nearly $8 million. In 2012-13, it was Kyle Orton, and he made $7.25 million. Johnson was a Super Bowl-winning quarterback and took two different teams to the playoffs. Kitna and Orton led teams to the playoffs.
The Cowboys were willing to pay a premium on the position, strangely, until Romo started to get hurt more. They went with Brandon Weeden in 2014 and ’15 on a low-cost deal. He lost his four starts as Romo’s replacement, including three in 2015, which was a disastrous year for the franchise with Romo starting four games because of a twice-broken collarbone.
After Romo got hurt the first time the Cowboys traded a fifth-round pick for veteran Matt Cassel and a seventh-round selection. Cassel’s experience was viewed as a positive, but he went 1-6 and had five touchdown passes and seven interceptions. Owner and general manager Jerry Jones did not forget that he paid Cassel nearly $2 million, and he failed to throw for more than 200 yards in five of those starts.
The following year, the Cowboys were planning on going with an untested Kellen Moore (one career start) as Romo’s backup until he broke his ankle the first week of training camp. After Romo suffered a broken bone in his back later that summer, they handed the keys to the franchise to Prescott, a fourth-round rookie, although they did add Mark Sanchez on a one-year, $2 million deal to back up Prescott.
Prescott has been driving ever since. (By the way, Moore is entering his third season as a Cowboys coach and second as the offensive coordinator.)
Prescott has been extremely durable despite taking 56 sacks in 2018 and a willingness to run (21 rushing touchdowns since 2016).
His 64 straight starts are the third-longest active streak among quarterbacks, trailing only Philip Rivers (224) and Russell Wilson (128), according to ESPN Stats & Information.
Thirteen quarterbacks started every game last season. Rivers, Wilson, Brett Favre and Eli Manning might be the exceptions to the rule when it comes to quarterbacks escaping injury. Maybe Prescott is more like them and won’t get hurt either.
Without Drew Brees last year, the New Orleans Saints won with Teddy Bridgewater. Matt Moore went 1-1 as Patrick Mahomes’ injury replacement in Kansas City.
The Cowboys would be extremely happy if Dalton never saw the field for any meaningful snaps in 2020.
But just in case, they prepared themselves for the possibility.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cowboys confirm deal for ex-Bengals QB Dalton</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Dallas Cowboys have signed former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton, the NFL franchise confirmed on Saturday.
Following reports, the Cowboys announced an agreement with Dalton on a one-year deal following his departure from the Bengals.
The deal for Dalton is reportedly worth a guaranteed $3million and could be worth up to $7m.
Dalton spent nine seasons with the Bengals and helped lead them to the playoffs five times before he was released on Thursday after Cincinnati selected Joe Burrow with the top overall pick in the NFL Draft.
Dalton posted a 70-61-2 regular-season record as Cincinnati's starting quarterback, but the Bengals have not won a playoff game since 1990.
In Dallas, Dalton will serve as backup to Dak Prescott – who was given the franchise tag by the Cowboys earlier this offseason.
Dallas are still trying to come to a long-term contract agreement with Prescott.
Dalton – the Bengals' career leader in touchdown passes and a three-time Pro Bowler – already has a home in Dallas and played in college at nearby TCU.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dez Bryant Is Not Happy With Cowboys Signing Andy Dalton</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Not everyone is a big man of the Dallas Cowboys’ new signing of quarterback Andy Dalton. Dez Bryant, the team’s former star wide receiver, thinks the move is “out of line.”
Dak Prescott is the team’s established starting quarterback. He and the team have struggled to come to a long-term deal. Whatever that contract winds up looking like, many anticipate that it will make him the highest-paid quarterback in the NFL.
NFL insider Ian Rapoport says that Dalton’s presence doesn’t mean much for Prescott. The Cowboys are bringing in the veteran as an insurance policy in case Dak gets injured. After adding pieces like receiver CeeDee Lamb, Dallas is clearly gearing up to make a run.
Even so, Bryant doesn’t like the optics of the team adding a big-name quarterback, without Dak getting his long-awaited extension. He thinks it signals that the team believes that it can plug in another quarterback, and isn’t actually committed to him as the franchise guy. He compared things to how the Cowboys treated Tony Romo, his quarterback for most of his time with the franchise.
Dez clearly sees the addition of Dalton as something as a shot across Dak’s bow, and has respect for the former Cincinnati Bengals starter. He says that he doesn’t believe this is just an insurance policy.
The longtime Cowboy star has shared many more thoughts about this, and is tweeting up a storm about the deal.
The move is definitely an interesting one. Andy Dalton is still a quality quarterback, even if he was displaced this year, and probably could have competed for a starting job elsewhere. It is unclear what the full market for him looked like.
As with all things related to America’s Team, this move is getting dissected far more than your average backup quarterback signing.
[Dez Bryant]

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NHL could face another hurdle if the league decides to continue the 2019-20 season in the near future — getting non-Canadian resident players across the border to join their respective teams.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Sunday that players would — at a minimum — need to follow quarantine protocols if they were to arrive in Canada while the border remains closed due to the pandemic.
"I think it's a question we'll have to look into," Trudeau said in a press briefing. "Certainly at a strict minimum, anyone who arrives from another country will have to follow all the rules of quarantine in an extremely strict manner, but we're not there yet in our discussions with the NHL."
"We recognize that it's a possibility, but it depends on an enormous amount of things, and I don't want to speculate on this until there's more discussion."
The Associated Press reported earlier this week that Edmonton and Toronto were being looked at as possible "hockey pod" cities that could host the remainder of the NHL season during the summer months. Games would be played in air-conditioned arenas without fans.
A person familiar with discussions told The Associated Press that the most aggressive timetable would have players returning to their home rinks as early as May 15, followed by a training camp and possible exhibition games in June.
Under that timeline, the regular season would resume in July with the Stanley Cup final likely stretching into September.
The league and NHL Players' Association have formed a joint committee to determine a path forward that could get games back on the ice sometime in July without fans in attendance.
The committee said Wednesday in a statement that they "have not made any decisions or set a timeline for possible return to play scenarios," but remained hopeful that players could return to their teams for "small group activities" by mid-to-late May.
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said recently that no decisions have been made and noted that government and medical officials will ultimately make the call on when sports can return.
The season was paused on March 12, one day after the World Health Organization classified the COVID-19 spread a pandemic — and one day after the NBA suspended its season following a positive novel coronavirus test on a Utah Jazz player.
As of early April, eight NHL players had tested positive for COVID-19, including five players on the Ottawa Senators.
Each team had between 10 and 14 games remaining on its regular-season schedule at the time of the suspension.
Four Canadian teams — Toronto, Edmonton, Calgary and Winnipeg — were all in playoff position as of March 12, with Vancouver on the bubble.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Trudeau: NHL players likely subject to quarantine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Should the NHL restart its 2019-20 season, players on Canadian teams who have been out of the country likely would need to quarantine before they can rejoin their teammates, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Sunday.
“I think it’s a question we’ll have to look into,” Trudeau said in a press briefing. “Certainly at a strict minimum, anyone who arrives from another country will have to follow all the rules of quarantine in an extremely strict manner, but we’re not there yet in our discussions with the NHL.”
He continued: “We recognize that it’s a possibility, but it depends on an enormous amount of things, and I don’t want to speculate on this until there’s more discussion.”
The season was halted on March 12, one day after the NBA suspended play when Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz was diagnosed with the coronavirus. At least eight NHL players have been diagnosed with COVID-19 — five of them from the Ottawa Senators.
The NHL is hoping to finish the 2019-20 season and award the Stanley Cup, while deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in a radio interview on Friday that Edmonton is among the cities under consideration should the league decide to use centralized locations for games. Toronto is another city reportedly in consideration to be a “hockey pod.”
Daly also said frequent testing for COVID-19 would be required for play to resume, provided that ample tests are available and that the general public would not be deprived of tests.
“We’re going to need to have access to testing, and we’re going to make it a point that we’re not accessing testing, even in a private way, if testing availability is an issue in the community,” Daly told 630 CHED in Edmonton. “We will not test asymptomatic players ahead of symptomatic people who are unable to get tested. It’s just something we will not do.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Serie A return decision changed by Italian government</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Serie A clubs will now be allowed to return to training on Monday, two weeks ahead of schedule, as football continues its attempts to come back from coronavirus chaos.
The Italian government had initially decreed that only athletes from individual sports would be allowed to recommence training from this Monday, with team sports scheduled for May 18.
But a decision from the regional assembly of Emilia-Romagna to bring their date forward resulted in a change of heart from national interior minister Matteo Piantedosi, who has now stated that training grounds can be opened providing that social distancing guidelines are followed.
Italian publications Corriere dello Sport and Gazzetta dello Sport both carried a note signed by Piantedosi, which read: “Athletes and non-athletes of non-individual disciplines, like every citizen, are allowed to participate in individual sports in public or private areas, respecting the interpersonal safety distance of at least two metres."
The decision in Emilia-Romagna had meant initially that just four Serie A clubs were planning to return on Monday - Sassuolo, Bologna, Parma and SPAL.
A Sassuolo statement read: "Players will only be allowed access to the pitches in compliance with rules of social distancing, while access to the Sports Center will be prohibited.
"The individual sessions, which will take place during the mornings from Monday to Friday, with the use of three fields, with six players per hour (one player for each half of the pitch), will not be attended by the technical staff, while an emergency health supervision will be guaranteed."
Training is only open to those players who have been in Italy during lockdown, with any player returning from outside of the country - such as Cristiano Ronaldo - forced into quarantine for two weeks.
There are still thought to be numerous obstacles to overcome to ensure Serie A starts again, with Juventus currently sitting one point ahead of Lazio at the top.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Serie A sides given green light to open training centres</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Serie A clubs are set to return to training grounds next week after getting the go ahead from the Italian Government.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte’s plans to ease lockdown restrictions had initially made provisions for individual athletes to resume work from Monday, with team sports scheduled to follow suit on May 18.
There were reports that the disparity of that approach was being challenged by some regional assemblies and the prospect of some top-flight clubs resuming while others remained banned from doing so has seemingly forced a change of heart.
Sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora called for a review of the decision and both Corriere dello Sport and Gazzetta dello Sport quote a communique signed by interior minister Matteo Piantedosi which allows for high performance centres to open their doors provided social distancing measures are observed.
“Athletes and non-athletes of non-individual disciplines, like every citizen, are allowed to participate in individual sports in public or private areas, respecting the interpersonal safety distance of at least two metres,” the note reportedly said.
Individual teams are likely to pursue their own arrangements now, steered by regional guidelines and their own preparedness to safely staff facilities.
There is no certainty that the Serie A season will resume, with Juventus top of the paused table just a point ahead of Lazio.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Spadafora reaffirms May 18 date for Serie A clubs to resume team training</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Italian sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora has reiterated Serie A team training will still not resume before May 18, despite the government allowing players to return to club facilities from Monday.
A statement from Italy's Home Office on Sunday declared individual athletes - including those who play for teams - can undertake sports activities again, provided they maintain social distancing.
On Saturday, Sassuolo became the first Serie A club to confirm they would be going back to training since the season was halted due to the coronavirus crisis.
Others in the top tier have since followed suit, including Inter, who will make pitches at their Appiano Gentile available to first-team squad members, albeit on a voluntary basis.
"The resumption of competitive activities will be determined and communicated as soon as the relevant regulatory framework is finalised," Inter said in a statement.
"All the other areas of the centre will remain closed with the exception of the on-site health and technical facility, which is required to ensure a safe environment and safeguard the athletes."
It is also reported table-topping Juventus - who sit one point clear of nearest rivals Lazio at the summit - have asked their players who are currently abroad to return to Italy, allowing them to undergo a period of isolation ahead of a potential resumption.
However, Spadafora had made clear full training will not be allowed before the country's lockdown measures expire on May 17.
"I read strange things around but nothing has changed compared to what I have always said about football: the teams' training will not resume before 18 May and the resumption of the championship for now is not really talked about," he wrote on Facebook.
"Now sorry but I'm going back to deal with all the other sports and sports centres (gyms, dance centres, swimming pools, etc) that must reopen as soon as possible!"
Italy has been one of the countries to suffer the most during the health crisis, with over 28,000 deaths related to COVID-19.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Serie A players set to resume training on Monday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rome/Berlin: Serie A clubs are in limbo with several regions of Italy allowing players to begin practicing on an individual basis at training centres on Monday while the government has set a May 18 return to the practice field for teams.
Sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora is seeking clarification from the government’s techno-scientific coronavirus commission.
Emilia-Romagna, Campania, Lazio and Sardinia have each given the go-ahead for teams in their regions to begin individual training. Those regions contain eight Serie A clubs: Bologna, Sassuolo, Spal, Parma, Napoli, Lazio, Roma and Cagliari.
Serie A has been suspended since March 9, when the government ordered a nationwide lockdown.
The government announced a week ago that individual athletes can resume training on May 4, while teams can restart May 18.
Meanwhile, Germany’s minister for interior Horst Seehofer has supported the proposed day for resumption of football in the country. German Football League (DFL) Chief Executive Christian Seifert had earlier said they are hoping to restart league football in the country on May 9 provided they get the green light from the government.
Seehofer stated he finds the proposal ‘plausible’ considering all the requisite government guidelines are followed by the officials and players.
“I find the schedule proposed by the German league plausible and I support the restart in May,” Horst Seehofer was quoted as saying by Bild.
“If there is a case of coronavirus in a team or its management, the club as a whole, and eventually also the team against which it last played, must go into quarantine for two weeks.
“There will continue therefore to be risks for the schedule of matches and for the classification, if there is any contamination,” he added.
The entire sporting calender of the world has been shredded due to coronavirus pandemic and football is no different.
Leagues in Netherlands, Belgium and France have been called off while other nations like England, Italy, Spain and Germany are battling hard to salvage their respective seasons.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sassuolo are set to become the first Serie A side to re-start training following the coronavirus shutdown after saying their players could use the club’s facilities from Monday on an optional basis.
Bologna, meanwhile, say their players will be able to start training from Tuesday.
Serie A has been suspended since March 9 and the league and the Italian football federation (FIGC) both want to complete the season although the Italian government says it has not yet decided whether it will give permission.
The government has given professional teams permission to train together from May 18 although they will still have to respect social distancing guidelines.
Sassuolo and Bologna are based in the region of Emilia Romagna which has given special permission for athletes in team sports to take part in training sessions on an individual basis from May 4 onwards.
“Sassuolo announces that, from Monday May 4, they will grant their players use of the Mapei Football Centre pitches for optional, individual sessions,” Sassuolo said in a statement.
The club said that only players would be allowed to access the pitches while the use of indoor facilities would be prohibited. Under Sassuolo’s guidelines, each player would have half a pitch to himself.
“The individual sessions will take place in the morning, from Monday to Friday, with the use of three pitches, with six athletes per hour (one athlete for each half of the field),” the club said, adding that coaching staff would not be present.
“An emergency health service will be guaranteed,” it added.
Bologna announced similar guidelines while Parma and SPAL, also based in Emilia Romagna, have not yet indicated whether they will start training.
The region of Campania, which includes Naples, has also said that players can begin training although Napoli have yet to comment.

Bologna, meanwhile, say their players will be able to start training from Tuesday.
Serie A has been suspended since March 9 and the league and the Italian football federation (FIGC) both want to complete the season although the Italian government says it has not yet decided whether it will give permission.
The government has given professional teams permission to train together from May 18 although they will still have to respect social distancing guidelines.
Sassuolo and Bologna are based in the region of Emilia Romagna which has given special permission for athletes in team sports to take part in training sessions on an individual basis from May 4 onwards.
"Sassuolo announces that, from Monday May 4, they will grant their players use of the Mapei Football Centre pitches for optional, individual sessions," Sassuolo said in a statement.
The club said that only players would be allowed to access the pitches while the use of indoor facilities would be prohibited. Under Sassuolo's guidelines, each player would have half a pitch to himself.
"The individual sessions will take place in the morning, from Monday to Friday, with the use of three pitches, with six athletes per hour (one athlete for each half of the field)," the club said, adding that coaching staff would not be present.
"An emergency health service will be guaranteed," it added.
Bologna announced similar guidelines while Parma and SPAL, also based in Emilia Romagna, have not yet indicated whether they will start training.
The region of Campania, which includes Naples, has also said that players can begin training although Napoli have yet to comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Roma to resume training as Serie A clubs eye return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roma will resume training activities next week amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Serie A team announced.
The 2019-20 Serie A season has been suspended since March due to the COVID-19 crisis, which has killed more than 244,500 people worldwide.
All teams in Italy are set to return to training on May 18, the day after the government's existing lockdown measures expire, but some are scheduled to resume earlier.
A decree issued by the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy on Thursday opened the door for Sassuolo, SPAL, Bologna and Parma to return to training next week.
Sassuolo were the first team to announce a resumption of training on Saturday, although social distancing rules must be complied with and there can be no mass gatherings.
And Roma followed suit, saying in a statement: "#ASRoma would like to thank the Lazio Regione for its sensitivity towards team sports.
"Next week, Roma players will undergo medical assessments and begin individual training sessions – observing safe distancing guidelines – at the Trigoria training centre."
An emergency meeting of Lega Serie A was held on Friday during which it was reported all 20 teams agreed to resume the campaign rather than follow the examples of the Eredivisie and Ligue 1, which ended their respective seasons amid the coronavirus pandemic.
After Italy's sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora warned the government could step in to bring the season to a conclusion if an agreement on medical protocols for the resumption of matches was not reached, Lega Serie A president Paolo Dal Pino's call for a united approach was seemingly heeded.
Defending champions Juventus were a point clear of Lazio through 26 games at the time of postponement.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Serie A Clubs Vote In Favour Of Resuming Season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">All 20 clubs in the Italian top flight, Serie A have voted in favour of resuming the 2019-20 season whenever possible. The news was confirmed through a conference call but the final call on the resumption of the league will be dependent on the government's approval. "Of course we want to play football, it would be against nature to say otherwise. Those who have a profession would always like to continue to do it, if it will be possible while respecting health standards and protocols," Goal.com quoted Paolo Dal Pino, the Serie A president, as saying.
"We will strictly adhere to government advice, as we have always done. They can be sure of our constructive and collaborative spirit and that my harmony with president of the FIGC Gabriele Gravina is absolute," he added.
There have been reports that a few clubs have been against restarting the season, with Italy having been one of the worst affected countries in Europe by the coronavirus. But an agreement has been reached between the teams and the Italian football federation.
Italy's domestic football competition Serie A has been suspended since March due to the coronavirus.
The league in France and the Netherlands have already confirmed their 2019-20 seasons are over.
On Sunday, Italy's Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte had revealed plans to gradually relax restrictions in the country and allowed the Serie A players to do individual training from May 4.
Italy's government will allow running in open spaces from May 4 while athletes in individual sports such as tennis will be allowed to return to their training facilities.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Regional government allows Napoli to resume training</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Napoli were on Saturday given the green light to restart training next week by regional authorities as Serie A clubs eye a return to action from the coronavirus pandemic shutdown.
The Campania region, where Napoli are based, said in a statement that "the region's positive ruling has already be sent to the government", adding that it had asked for an OK as soon as possible "in order to enable training to restart on Monday".
Campania is the second region in Italy to allow its local Serie A club to recommence preparations, under strict health guidelines, at their training ground after Emilia-Romagna made a similar ruling on Friday for Bologna, Parma, SPAL and Sassuolo.
Lazio, which hosts the Rome-based club of the same name and city rivals Roma, Hellas Verona's home the Veneto and Sardinia, where Cagliari are based, are expected to follow suit.
The announcement comes despite a government decree which stops players from training at their locked-off sports centres where social distancing could be guaranteed, but allows them to run in public parks.
Italy is preparing to relax its lockdown on Monday as the Covid-19 numbers continue a positive trend. The virus has killed over 28 000 people in the country. Many regions have had a fraction of the number of deaths experienced by Lombardy and Piedmont in the north.
On Friday, Serie A unanimously voted to finish the 2019-20 season, suspended since 9 March.
However, Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora this week said the chances of restarting were "increasingly narrow". He also vowed to ensure that football's finances would be "damaged as little as possible" should the season be declared over.

Friday’s league meeting also addressed the issue of TV rights, but no resolutions were adopted concerning broadcasters Sky, DAZN and IMG, with a final payment estimated at 340 million euros ($370 million) for the current season, due to be paid in May.
FIGC president Gabriele Gravina has said that calling time would be “the death of Italian football”, predicting losses of over 800 million euros in TV rights, sponsors, ticketing and marketing.
If the government did decide to pull the plug on the season it would have the support of a country traumatised by over 28,000 coronavirus deaths.
According to a recent survey, two out of three Italians would support a stoppage, in particular in the northern epicentre, stronghold of heavyweights Juventus, Inter Milan and AC Milan and Atalanta.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Soccer-Serie A's Sassuolo say players can start training from Monday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ROME — Sassuolo are set to become the first Serie A side to re-start training following the coronavirus shutdown after saying their players could use the club’s facilities from Monday on an optional basis.
Bologna, meanwhile, say their players will be able to start training from Tuesday.
Serie A has been suspended since March 9 and the league and the Italian football federation (FIGC) both want to complete the season although the Italian government says it has not yet decided whether it will give permission.
The government has given professional teams permission to train together from May 18 although they will still have to respect social distancing guidelines.
Sassuolo and Bologna are based in the region of Emilia Romagna which has given special permission for athletes in team sports to take part in training sessions on an individual basis from May 4 onwards.
“Sassuolo announces that, from Monday May 4, they will grant their players use of the Mapei Football Centre pitches for optional, individual sessions,” Sassuolo said in a statement.
The club said that only players would be allowed to access the pitches while the use of indoor facilities would be prohibited. Under Sassuolo’s guidelines, each player would have half a pitch to himself.
“The individual sessions will take place in the morning, from Monday to Friday, with the use of three pitches, with six athletes per hour (one athlete for each half of the field),” the club said, adding that coaching staff would not be present.
“An emergency health service will be guaranteed,” it added.
Bologna announced similar guidelines while Parma and SPAL, also based in Emilia Romagna, have not yet indicated whether they will start training.
The region of Campania, which includes Naples, has also said that players can begin training although Napoli have yet to comment.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tennis back on the menu in Austria, but don't shake on it</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Austria’s loosened lockdown means tennis players can return to the court as long as they stick to coronavirus-related rules – singles only, no touching each other’s tennis balls and definitely no shaking hands at the net.
Tennis is one of several social-distancing-compatible sports the conservative-led government allowed to resume from last Friday (May 1), part of a second wave of lockdown easing. Others include golf, horse riding, archery, shooting and mini golf.
Austria introduced its lockdown seven weeks ago and first relaxed it on April 14, when some shops were allowed to reopen. Leaving home for exercise like jogging was officially encouraged but sports clubs were closed, and most still are.
“During quarantine, I was wondering which wall I could play against and now I’m glad that I can finally play on court,” a player who gave his name as Yannis said at Smashing Suns, a club in Vienna’s upscale 13th district, which also houses the Schoenbrunn – a former imperial palace.
When he announced last month that some sports would resume, sports minister Werner Kogler said it would be up to federations to decide what new rules to impose to prevent infections and he singled out tennis as already having a list.
That list is on display at Smashing Suns. It includes arriving in tennis gear as changing rooms are closed and a recommendation that players mark their own balls.
Touching your opponent is banned, as are doubles matches and playing indoors.
“The players will definitely stick to them (the new rules), also because we check that they do. They are very disciplined and the pleasure of playing is greater than the willingness to risk something,” the club’s co-owner Dieter Mocker said.
“People definitely miss playing doubles. Almost 80 per cent of our members want to play doubles and we hope that will be possible again soon.”
For now, relief seems to be the overriding sentiment.
“The last few weeks were very bad without any exercise – I walked a bit, but otherwise nothing,” said regular player Michaela Werni.
“Not seeing tennis friends was a drastic reduction in my quality of life...
“Now it is great and a totally new experience to finally be able to move around outdoors and with nice friends, even if it is with some restrictions.” – REUTERS

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rashford can reach the level of Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d’Or, says Darmian</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford can reach the same level as Kylian Mbappe and go on to win the Ballon d'Or, according to former Manchester United team-mate Matteo Darmian.
Rashford has enjoyed his most productive season in terms of goals in 2019-20, scoring 19 in all competitions for the Red Devils despite being sidelined since January due to a back injury.
The England international burst onto the scene early in 2016 under Louis van Gaal, finding the net twice on both his Europa League and Premier League debuts after coming through the club's academy system.
Darmian, however, is not surprised at the 22-year-old's continued development since then, having seen at close quarters just how good the forward is.
"I still remember Marcus Rashford's first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday. I immediately thought, 'wow, this is an incredible player'," he told the Guardian.
"He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me."
The Italian defender, who returned to his homeland last September by signing for Parma, feels the England international can still get even better, too.
Darmian feels Rashford has the potential to match Paris Saint-Germain superstar Mbappe, the pair perhaps competing for individual honours for many years to come.
"If he [Rashford] continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d'Or winner. I'm convinced of this," he said.
"He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he's very young and can still improve. For me, he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d’Or for years to come."
The full-back worked under Van Gaal and Jose Mourinho during his time at Old Trafford, as well as current boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
"I can only speak well about Solskjaer, believe me," Darmian said of the Norwegian. "I would give him a long-term contract.
"He's a very prepared coach and Manchester United has started this project, this journey, with many young players, many British players and they will continue with this project.
"Because of the person I got to know, I hope Solskjaer has success at the club."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United's Marcus Rashford can match Kylian Mbappe, says Matteo Darmian</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford has the potential to compete with Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe for the Ballon d'Or in the near future, according to former Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian.
The 22-year-old is one of the success stories of the Red Devils' academy and has flourished into one of the Premier League's best forwards ever since bursting onto the scene in 2016.
Darmian, at United between 2015 and 2019, recalls how impressive the youngster was in his first training session at the club's Carrington base and predicts his former team-mate can reach the levels of World Cup winner Mbappe.
"I still remember Marcus Rashford's first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday," he told The Guardian. "I immediately thought: 'Wow, this is an incredible player'.
"He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me. If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d'Or winner. I'm convinced of this.
"He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he's very young and can still improve. For me he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d'Or for years to come."
The 30-year-old left Old Trafford last summer and signed a four-year deal with Serie A side Parma, returning to his native Italy four years after departing for England, although he has plenty of sweet memories of his time in the Premier League.
Darmian was relegated to the bench ever since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer took the reins in December 2019 but despite the lack of playing time he only has praise for the United boss and has backed him to steer the club back to glory days.
"I can only speak well about Solksjær, believe me," Darmian says. "I would give him a long-term contract.
"He's a very prepared coach and Manchester United has started this project, this journey, with many young players, many British players and they will continue with this project. Because of the person I got to know, I hope Solskjær has success at the club.
"I remember my first game for United being an incredible emotion. I felt like a child. Old Trafford is something fantastic, there's a reason that it's called the theatre of dreams.
"My debut was perfect because we beat Tottenham at home and I heard the fans screaming my name: a wonderful feeling. I felt a lot of pride but also the responsibility to play for one of the best clubs in the world."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United fans react to Marcus Rashford and Kylian Mbappe comparison</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Matteo Darmian claims that Marcus Rashford can reach the levels of Paris Saint-Germain ace Kylian Mbappe and challenge for the Ballon d'Or.
Rashford is United's top scorer this season, with 19 goals in all competitions before a back injury cut short his season prior to the postponement of the Premier League campaign.
Darmian left United in the summer transfer window to return to Italy with Parma but has fond memories of playing alongside Rashford.
"I still remember Marcus Rashford’s first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday," he told The Guardian. "I immediately thought: ‘wow, this is an incredible player’. He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me.
"If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d’Or winner. I’m convinced of this. He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he’s very young and can still improve. For me he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappé and compete for the Ballon d’Or for years to come."
Some United fans believe Rashford has already reached the same level of Mbappe as he has proved his ability in a much tougher league.
United great Rio Ferdinand recently pinpointed Rashford as a player United should look to build around in the coming years and referenced Mbappe in his argument.
"Rashford can be up there with the best 100 per cent, because he's got mad talent," Ferdinand told The Beautiful Game podcast.
"From a kid, I've seen him play, whether it was up front or wide, or drifting about, he's always had mad talent and Man United have always known. It's whether you can translate that to being in the first-team and he's shown he can do that. He's just been unfortunate he's been in a team that's been in transition ever since he's been in the first-team.
"It's very different to, say, Mbappe coming into a Paris Saint-Germain team that's going to win it every year, fighting for trophies on all fronts, the confidence levels are there, there's no finding out period with any of the players there. They're a consistent, well-oiled machine in their league and that league's not as hard either, but Mbappe's major.
"It seems like Ole was getting the consistency in the squad and that was when [Rashford] wasn't playing, which was the disappointing part. So fingers crossed, if he can get back to normal he can get back to some consistency and they can start trying to get back to the heights of where Man United were at before. And then I think we'll see more from Marcus, because if I'm Man United I'm building it all around him."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man Utd star Marcus Rashford tipped to fight Kylian Mbappe for Ballon d'Or</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford has been backed to take on Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe for future Ballon d'Or awards by former teammate Matteo Darmian.
Mbappe, 21, is arguably the most exciting up-and-coming prospect in Europe thanks to his explosive performances for PSG and France - who he spearheaded to victory at the 2018 World Cup.
The former Monaco man picked up the award for the Best Young Player at the tournament and he has continued to shine on the big stage, scoring or assisting 10 goals in seven appearances in this season's Champions League.
But Darmian - who spent four years training with Rashford before moving to Serie A club Parma last summer - believes the England international has what it takes to challenge Mbappe.
"I still remember Marcus Rashford's first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday," Darmian told The Guardian. "I immediately thought: 'Wow, this is an incredible player.'
"He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me. If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d'Or winner.
"I'm convinced of this. He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he's very young and can still improve. For me he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d'Or for years to come."
Mbappe finished sixth in the 2019 Ballon d'Or voting while Rashford was not among the 30 nominees.
However, the Red Devils academy product was enjoying an excellent 2019/20 season before suffering a serious back injury in January.
The 22-year-old scored 19 goals and provided five assists in all competitions and is expected to be fit for when the season resumes as the coronavirus pandemic eases.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rashford can reach the level of Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d’Or, says Darmian</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford can reach the same level as Kylian Mbappe and go on to win the Ballon d'Or, according to former Manchester United team-mate Matteo Darmian.
Rashford has enjoyed his most productive season in terms of goals in 2019-20, scoring 19 in all competitions for the Red Devils despite being sidelined since January due to a back injury.
The England international burst onto the scene early in 2016 under Louis van Gaal, finding the net twice on both his Europa League and Premier League debuts after coming through the club's academy system.
Darmian, however, is not surprised at the 22-year-old's continued development since then, having seen at close quarters just how good the forward is.
"I still remember Marcus Rashford's first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday. I immediately thought, 'wow, this is an incredible player'," he told the Guardian.
"He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me."
The Italian defender, who returned to his homeland last September by signing for Parma, feels the England international can still get even better, too.
Darmian feels Rashford has the potential to match Paris Saint-Germain superstar Mbappe, the pair perhaps competing for individual honours for many years to come.
"If he [Rashford] continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d'Or winner. I'm convinced of this," he said.
"He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he's very young and can still improve. For me, he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d’Or for years to come."
The full-back worked under Van Gaal and Jose Mourinho during his time at Old Trafford, as well as current boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
"I can only speak well about Solskjaer, believe me," Darmian said of the Norwegian. "I would give him a long-term contract.
"He's a very prepared coach and Manchester United has started this project, this journey, with many young players, many British players and they will continue with this project.
"Because of the person I got to know, I hope Solskjaer has success at the club."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unai Emery, the former Arsenal and Paris Saint-Germain coach, has named Brazilian football star Neymar as the likely successor to Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.
In an interview with Spanish newspaper Marca, Emery said that Neymar has all the chances to become the world's best player. 
The 28-year-old Neymar won seven titles with Barcelona before his transfer to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017, where he won three Ligue 1 titles while the club was coached by Emery. 
Lionel Messi is an Argentine forward who plays and captains both Spanish club Barcelona and his home country's national team.
Cristiano Ronaldo is a Portuguese footballer who is a forward for Serie A club Juventus and captain of Portugal's national team.
The two football stars have won 11 of the last 12 Ballon d'Or awards between them.

"Things have gone well for him at the club and he has done great things, so it will be painful, but he will leave. I'm sure Inter will replace him well," the former Atalanta, Parma, Torino and Napoli footballer concluded.

The Brazilian is currently the world's most expensive footballer following his move from Barcelona to PSG in the summer of 2017.
Both Messi and Ronaldo are already slowing down having stayed on top of their games well over one and a half-decade.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi's successor named by Unai Emery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unai Emery has identified the star who will "take over" from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the world's best player.
Messi and Ronaldo have dominated European football for over a decade, winning 11 of the last 12 Ballon d'Or awards between them.
But the duo's time at top of the game is slowly coming to an end and Emery has identified a player he previously coached as the heir to the title of best in the world.
The Spaniard has managed at Sevilla and Arsenal, where he was sacked last November after a poor run of form, but the player he has named as Messi and Ronaldo's successor comes from his time as Paris Saint-Germain boss.
And that star is Brazil icon Neymar, who worked with Emery at Parc des Princes after joining PSG from Barcelona in a world-record £198m transfer in 2017.
Emery discussed his "magnificent" season in charge of Neymar and insists that the forward has the ability to become the best player in the world.
"The year I was with him [Neymar] was magnificent," Emery told Spanish newspaper Marca. "I learned a lot from seeing his answers in each training session and in the matches.

"Neymar has football inside, but also the faculties and the conditions to execute it. I think he is facing the opportunity to take over from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to be the best player in the world, and he has time to do it."
Neymar is seven years younger than Ronaldo and four years younger than Messi at 28 years old and has enjoyed a glittering career so far.
He won seven titles with Barcelona before moving to France and has won three Ligue 1 titles in a row after it was announced that PSG would be awarded this season's title despite the campaign being cancelled in the week.
During their season together, Emery and Neymar won the domestic treble but the Spaniard left his role at the end of the campaign.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Unai Emery reveals who will 'take over' from Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brazil superstar Neymar has been backed to ‘take over’ from Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi as the best player in the world by former Arsenal and PSG manager Unai Emery.
Neymar started his career at Brazilian club Santos before moving to Barcelona in 2013 and winning two La Liga titles and the Champions League at the Nou Camp.
The forward made a surprising move to PSG three years ago and has continued to impress in the French capital, scoring 69 goals in 80 matches and winning three successive league titles.
Emery insists it was ‘magnificent’ working with Neymar while he was in charge of PSG and says the Brazilian can take over from Ronaldo and Messi as the best player on the planet.
Ronaldo and Messi are two of the best players in the history of the game and have won 11 of the last 12 Ballon d’Or awards.
‘The year I was with him [Neymar] was magnificent,’ former Arsenal and PSG manager Emery told Marca.
‘I learned a lot from seeing his answers in each training session and in the matches.
‘Neymar has football inside, but also the faculties and the conditions to execute it.
‘I think he is facing the opportunity to take over from Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to be the best player in the world, and he has time to do it.’
Emery won a number of trophies at PSG but struggled at Premier League club Arsenal and was sacked after just 16 months in charge. The Spaniard has been out of work since his axing in November 2019.
On Thursday, Neymar’s PSG were awarded the Ligue 1 title after it was announced the season would not resume because of the coronavirus pandemic.
PSG were 12 points clear at the top of the table when French football was suspended indefinitely on March 13.
The club said in a statement that they wished to dedicate the title ‘to healthcare staff and all the everyday heroes on the front line’.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cristiano Ronaldo is no match for Brazilian legend Ronaldo - ex-Man United star Silvestre</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Cristiano Ronaldo is unarguable one of the best players football has seen so far
- The Portuguese star has won virtually everything in football but the FIFA World Cup
- Former teammate Silvestre believes his greatness cannot be compared to that of Brazil's Ronaldo
Former Manchester United star Mikael Silvestre has insisted that Cristiano Ronaldo should never be compared to Brazilian legend Ronaldo de Lima.
The 42-year-old former defender who also spent a couple of years at Arsenal played alongside both forwards at club and country levels.
Silvestre was Cristiano's teammate at Old Trafford while he played with the former Barcelona and Inter Milan star at the national team level.
He claimed the Portuguese star has just about three of four tricks he uses most of the times but with De Lima, it was a new style at every given chance.

The ex-Arsenal defender - who played with Cristiano at Man United - told MUTV Group Chat: "He was unstoppable.
"You called him ‘El Fenomeno’ then. I played against Messi and I played with Cristiano at Manchester United.
"But [Brazilian Ronaldo] is something else in terms of speed. Everything is top-level [with Ronaldo].
"Cristiano, maybe you can guess that he has three or four tricks he would use most of the time. "But Ronnie, it was always something different.
“He was inventing things on the spot, so you can’t guide him left or right because he’s going to get out of these situations, no matter what.
"He could score from any type of position. He was playing on one leg at some points and was still beating defenders all over Europe."
Jose Mourinho also attested to this claim having named the former Barcelona forward as the best of all time.

The former Chelsea boss also manage Cristiano at Real Madrid, but his reply when asked who he thought the greatest player of all time was, he said: "Ronaldo, El Fenomeno.
"Cristiano Ronaldo and Leo Messi have had longer careers, they have remained at the top every day for 15 years.
"However, if we are talking strictly about talent and skill, nobody surpasses Ronaldo [Nazario].
"When he was at Barcelona with Bobby Robson, I realised that he was the best player I'd ever seen take to the field.

Legit.ng earlier reported that Jose Mourinho has snubbed the duo of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo thereby picking Brazilian football legend Ronaldo Delima as the world's best player.
The duo of Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are widely considered as the best players in the world at least for the past 15 years considering what they have achieved in their careers.
But Jose Mourinho who is also one of the best managers in the world felt Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are not the best footballers in the world naming Delima Nasaro ahead of them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Neymar ready to usurp Messi and Ronaldo, says Emery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Unai Emery believes Neymar has the capacity to usurp Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo as the best player in the world.
Former Paris Saint-Germain head coach Emery worked with Neymar for his first season in France after the Brazil international's €222million move from Barcelona in 2017.
The Spaniard, who left PSG in 2018 and went on to manage Arsenal, loved his experience with Neymar and continues to believe in the 28-year-old's world-class ability.
"I had a magnificent year with him," Emery said, per EFE, in an interview with Granada coach Diego Martinez, who was his assistant at Sevilla.
"I learned so much watching his responses in each training session and in games.
"Neymar has the talent inside him but also the ability and qualities to execute it.
"I think he's got an opportunity to take the baton from Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and be the best player in the world, and he has the time to do it."
Neymar has won six trophies in his three seasons at PSG, including a Ligue 1 title in each year.
Champions League success has so far eluded him in France, though PSG had secured a quarter-final place in this season's competition before the coronavirus pandemic brought a halt to major football.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rohit has an edge over Kohli in terms of impact in white-ball format, Gautam Gambhir says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: Former India opener Gautam Gambhir feels that Rohit Sharma has been able to make more impact in white ball cricket compared to Virat Kohli despite Indian skipper’s staggering statistics in shorter formats.
Gambhir, however, believes that Kohli will end up scoring more runs than Rohit.
“For me white-ball cricket is all about impact. Kohli will end up getting many more runs than Rohit, and Kohli is among the greatest right now, but Rohit has an edge over Kohli because of the impact he has,” Gambhir told Sports Tak, according to India Today website.
“I think he [Rohit] is the best white-ball cricketer in the world right now. He is not the greatest overall but at the moment he is the best. He is the only player to have hit 3 ODI double hundreds, 5 World Cup hundreds (in one edition) and he is also the only player, who once gets past 100-run mark, people say that he missed a double century.”
Talking further about Kohli and Rohit, the 2011 World Cup winner said: “It is very difficult to compare both of them. Virat Kohli is unbelievable. His stats prove that.
“But when your reputation is such that when you get out after a hundred, people say he has missed out on double hundred, that speaks volumes about you.”
The 33-year-old Rohit has scored 9,115 runs from 224 ODIs at an average of 49.27 and a strike rate of 88.92. He has 29 hundreds and 43 fifties to his name. In T20Is, Rohit has scored 2,273 runs from 108 matches at an average of 32.62 and a strike rate of 138.78.
The 31-year-old Kohli, on the other hand, has scored 11,867 runs from 248 ODIs at an average of 59.33 and a strike rate of 93.25. He has scored 43 centuries and 58 half centuries. Kohli has also scored 2,794 runs from 82 T20Is at an average of 50.80 and a strike rate of 138.24.
The 38-year-old Gambhir, now a BJP Member of Parliament, gave credit to Mahendra Singh Dhoni for Rohit’s successful career.
“Where Rohit is today, it is because of MS Dhoni. One good thing about MS was that he always kept Rohit in the talks, even if he was not part of the team, he was always part of the group. He never let him get sidelined,” Gambhir said.
It’s the backing of captain that makes or breaks a player, Gambhir said.
“You can talk about the selection committee and team management, but if you do not have the backing from your captain then it is all useless. Everything is in the hands of the captain. How MS Dhoni had backed Rohit Sharma over a period of time, I do not think any player has been given such support.”
Rohit made his ODI debut for India in 2007, but it was only after Dhoni promoted him as an opener in 2013 that his career turned around.
He said Kohli and Rohit should groom youngsters in the current team in the same way Dhoni groomed them.
“Rohit is the prime example of how a player’s fortunes can turn around if he is nurtured by the seniors. I hope the young cricketers in the current generation, be it Shubman Gill or Sanju Samson, they also get similar kind of support.
“And now when Rohit is a senior, I expect him to back youngsters.”

The 31-year-old Kohli, on the other hand, has scored 11867 runs from 248 ODIs at an average of 59.33 at a strike rate of 93.25. He has scored 43 centuries and 58 half centuries. Kohli has also scored 2794 runs from 82 T20Is at an average of 50.80 and a strike rate of 138.24.
The 38-year-old Gambhir, now a BJP Member of Parliament, gave credit to Mahendra Singh Dhoni for Rohit’s successful career.
“Where Rohit is today, it is because of MS Dhoni. One good thing about MS was that he always kept Rohit in the talks, even if was not part of the team, he was always part of the group. He never let him get sidelined,” Gambhir said.
“You can talk about the selection committee and team management, but if you do not have the backing from your captain than it is all useless. Everything is in the hands of the captain. How MS Dhoni had backed Rohit Sharma over a period of time, I do not think any player has been given such support.”
Rohit made his ODI debut for India in 2007, but it was only after Dhoni promoted him as an opener in 2013 that his career turned around.
He said Kohli and Rohit should groom youngsters in the current team in the same way Dhoni groomed them.
“Rohit is the prime example of how a player’s fortunes can turn around if he is nurtured by the seniors. I hope the young cricketers in the current generation, be it Shubman Gill or Sanju Samson, they also get similar kind of support.
“And now when Rohit is a senior, I expect him to back youngsters.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rohit Sharma has edge over Virat Kohli in white-ball cricket, says Gautam Gambhir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rohit Sharma has an edge over Virat Kohli in cricket’s shorter formats even though Kohli will end up with more runs in his career, former India opener Gautam Gambhir said. He said this is because of the ‘impact’ Rohit has in ODIs and T20Is, adding that the current India opener is the ‘best white-ball cricketer in the world right now’.
“For me white-ball cricket is all about impact. Kohli will end up getting many more runs than Rohit, and Kohli is among the greatest right now, but Rohit has an edge over Kohli because of the impact he has,” Gambhir told Sports Tak.
“I think he (Rohit) is the best white-ball cricketer in the world right now. He is not the greatest overall but at the moment he is the best. He is the only player to have hit 3 ODI double hundreds, 5 World Cup hundreds (in one edition) and he is also the only player, who once gets past 100-run mark, people say that he missed a double century.”
Gambhir also said that Kohli’s batting records speak enough about his class.
The 33-year-old Rohit has scored 9115 runs from 224 ODIs at an average of 49.27 at a strike rate of 88.92. He has 29 hundreds and 43 fifties to his name. In T20Is, Rohit has scored 2273 runs from 108 matches at an average of 32.62 and a strike rate of 138.78.
The 31-year-old Kohli, on the other hand, has scored 11867 runs from 248 ODIs at an average of 59.33 at a strike rate of 93.25. He has scored 43 centuries and 58 half centuries. Kohli has also scored 2794 runs from 82 T20Is at an average of 50.80 and a strike rate of 138.24.
Gambhir also added that Rohit Sharma had prospered because of the backing he had received from MS Dhoni. “Where Rohit is today, it is because of MS Dhoni. One good thing about MS was that he always kept Rohit in the talks, even if was not part of the team, he was always part of the group. He never let him get sidelined,” Gambhir said. “I don’t think any player received such support,” he added.
Speaking later in the chat, Gambhir also named his all-time Test XI for India.
Gambhir’s all-time India Test XI – Sunil Gavaskar, Virender Sehwag, Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli, Kapil Dev, MS Dhoni, Harbhajan Singh, Anil Kumble (captain), Zaheer Khan and Javagal Srinath.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pogba could have fewer suitors post-coronavirus - Juve chief</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul Pogba could have fewer suitors in the coming transfer window as clubs struggle to fund deals, according to Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici.
Former Juve star Pogba has long been linked with a move away from current club Manchester United, with the Bianconeri, Inter and Real Madrid mooted as potential destinations.
However, football has been suspended and in some cases abandoned for the season in Europe's top leagues amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Elite clubs have been forced to seek agreements with players for wage cuts or deferrals in order to save money, with income from television deals in the balance and ticket sales unlikely to return soon.
Paratici suggests Pogba is one example of a star name who could find his pathway blocked in the market.
"[Pogba] is a great footballer, but this type of player could struggle to have the same interest as before," the Juve chief told Sky Sport Italia.
Stressing a need to be "creative" with moves, Paratici explained: "In the near future, the transfer market will have less money.
"We are going through a complicated time globally. We will have to rely on exchanges, on long loans. If you cannot buy a house, you rent. The same thing will happen in football.
"It is a formula that will be used to dilute the payments and take advantage of the players required.
"If we talk about the top 10 or 20 teams in the world exchanging players, the market values ​​will not go down.
"On the other hand, wages will drop, while if you sell a single player, his value could drop."
World Cup winner Pogba is in his fourth season back at United, having returned to Old Trafford - where he came through the academy - after a successful four-year stint at Juve.
While with the Serie A giants, Pogba won a quartet of Scudetti, two Coppa Italias, two Supercoppa Italianas and reached the 2014-15 Champions League final.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Juventus chief admits Paul Pogba wage demands are a problem</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Pogba continues to be linked with a move away from Old Trafford, with Inter Milan, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid believed to be interested in signing the 2018 World Cup winner this summer.
Paratici, though, has claimed that the 27-year-old will struggle to find a club prepared to meet his salary demands due to the impact the coronavirus outbreak has had thus far and will continue to have in the coming months.
"Pogba is a great player, but logically the salary demands someone of his level would've had before is now more difficult to get hold of, or at least he'll have fewer clubs prepared to pay that money." Paratici told Sky Sport Italia.
Inter have allegedly emerged as the front runners for the France international as they are prepared to pay cash for the midfielder rather than offering a swap deal.
Pogba, who could reportedly be available for £60m this summer, has not turned out for United in 2020 due to an ankle injury which ultimately required surgery.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Paul Pogba sent transfer warning amid uncertain future at Man Utd</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul Pogba has been warned he will have fewer options because of the financial impact of the coronavirus if he tries to quit Manchester United.
Pogba attempted to leave United last summer and is wanted by Real Madrid and Juventus.
Juventus’ chief football officer Fabio Paratici claims fewer clubs can afford Pogba’s wage demands because the shutdown is costing them millions.
Pogba, 27, earns £290,000-a-week and Paratici says the landscape has changed.
“Pogba is a great player, we know him as a champion,” Paratici told Sky Italia.
“But something will change after the virus crisis because logically the salary demands someone of his level would have had before is now more difficult to get hold of, or at least he’ll have fewer clubs prepared to pay that money.”
Paratici’s comments may be a ploy to persuade Pogba to lower his contract demands to secure a return to Juventus and he quit the Serie A giants in 2016 to rejoin United in a then world record £89million deal.
Pogba claims he is still motivated to succeed, despite managing only eight appearances through injury before the shutdown.
“We have got to stay motivated, there’s no other choice,” he said. “We don’t know how long it will be like this, but I still have goals in my head and one day hopefully this will stop.
“And then we have to get back on the pitch, so we have to be ready. For myself, I have been out for a long time as well, so for me I just want to get back playing football.”
Meanwhile, Marcos Rojo appears to have broken the lockdown rules in his native Argentina after the defender, who is on loan at Estudiantes, was filmed smoking and playing cards with a group of friends.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Juventus make Paul Pogba Manchester United transfer admission</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici has warned Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba that any interested clubs may struggle to meet his salary demands due to the coronavirus crisis.
Speculation over Pogba 's future continues with Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus all linked with the Frenchman.
Pogba's contract is due to expire next summer, though United have the option to extend it for a further year. MEN Sport understand United are yet to trigger the clause and are relaxed about his future.
MEN Sport reported in February that the midfielder had told teammates he still wanted to leave the club after failing to secure a move last summer.
Paratici believes Juventus and other interested parties may not be able to afford Pogba's wages if he does seek an exit in the upcoming transfer window.
"Paul Pogba is a fantastic player, we know him as a champion," he told Sky Sport Italia .
"But something will change after the coronavirus crisis, because logically the salary demands someone at his level would have had before is now more difficult to get hold of.
"Or, at least, he’ll have fewer clubs prepared to pay that money."
Cristiano Ronaldo is currently the top earner at the Serie A side and Paratici explained that Pogba could not be offered a similar salary to the former Manchester United superstar.
The Italian feels clubs will need to find other solutions in the transfer market due to the financial climate.
He added: "Cristiano is a different player to all the others. He brings incredible and exponential growth in revenue, representing a brand that is almost as big as a club.
"Clubs will certainly have some more difficulties to deal with, so with less income, we’ll need to be more creative and elastic, finding a different formula for transfer deals.
"I expect many exchanges of players, although obviously we can’t use the NBA draft because that is a closed system.
"We should take more from the NBA and American sports in general. After all, the Premier League has this big advantage over the other leagues because they control the brand and represent the whole league rather than individual clubs."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Arsenal in talks over summer sale of attacker in player-plus-cash deal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to the Mirror, Arsenal have been in talks with Roma regarding the potential permanent sale of Henrikh Mkhitaryan as part of a player-plus-cash deal.
The 31-year-old has been impressive for the Italian giants since joining on loan last summer, the Mirror add that the Gunners are ready to sell the star in a bid to raise transfer funds for the next window.
It’s added that Roma are keen on keeping the playmaker in Italy on a permanent basis, manager Paul Fonseca confirmed as much in a recent interview, per the Daily Mirror.
The Mirror suggest that Arsenal could receive around £10m for the Armenian star’s services, though Roma are yet to meet this valuation – which isn’t surprising considering the ace has just a year left on his contract.
Whilst it’s reported that talks have been held regarding a player-plus-cash deal, the Mirror report that the Gunners would prefer a pure cash sale of Mkhitaryan.
The Mirror add that as Mkhitaryan it out on loan, he wasn’t included in the discussions which led to most of Arsenal’s players agreeing a 12.5% pay cut for the next year in order to ease the financial impact that the Coronavirus pandemic has had on the Gunners.
Based on this, we’d think that Arsenal should prioritise Mkhitaryan’s sale in the next transfer window as he’s a star that no longer plays an important first-team role and he’s reportedly one of their top earners.
After difficult spells in England with both Manchester United and the Gunners, the ace has managed to rejuvenate himself in Italy – much like Roma teammate and Red Devils loanee Chris Smalling has.
Despite some struggles with injuries earlier in the season, Mkhitaryan has bagged six goals and registered three assists from 17 appearances for Roma this season.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Newcastle United could table a stunning bid for long-term Wolverhampton Wanderers target Franck Kessie, according to reports.
The midfielder has been linked to Wolves in each of the last two transfer windows with AC Milan reportedly ready to sell if the right offer comes in.
It is believed that a fee of between £22m and £26m would be enough to sign the 23-year-old.
Recent reports from Italy stated Kessie isn't likely to fit Ralf Rangnick's style with the German coach lined up to succeed Stefano Pioli as Milan boss.
According to MilanLive, Newcastle could meet the Serie A side's demands to complete a deal in the next transfer window.
The Magpies are in the process of being taken over by a wealthy consortium led by Amanda Staveley with backing from Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund.
Kessie spent two seasons on loan at the San Siro before Milan completed his signing on permanent terms from Atalanta last year.
As well as Wolves, Arsenal and West Ham United have also been linked with the Ivory Coast international who has made 25 appearances this season, scoring once.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Foxtel 'confident' it can fulfil under-represented sport obligations</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Foxtel is "confident" it can fulfil its under-represented sport obligations even though the COVID-19 pandemic has decimated sporting codes across the country.
The pay TV provider is required to broadcast under-represented sports such as women's football, basketball and soccer as part of a $30 million federal government grant.
The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications is due to assess Foxtel's 12-month performance in July. The government will then determine whether the News Corp-owned broadcaster will be eligible for the grant's final instalment of $7.5 million.
Coronavirus has disrupted almost a quarter of this year's sporting calendar. Major codes such as the AFL and NRL right through to softball and lawn bowls have all been affected. But Fox Sports boss Peter Campbell is confident Foxtel will pass the government's final assessment because the broadcaster had not only met but exceeded the 2019-20 benchmarks prior to COVID-19 shutdowns.
"Fox Sports has worked hard over the past year to produce, televise and build audiences for women's and under-represented sport in Australia, which have struggled to secure coverage on free-to-air television," he said.
"The careers of many athletes in under-represented sports, particularly female athletes, have flourished as a result of the coverage."
Some critics have argued the federal government should have distributed the $30 million grant to public broadcasters so Australians can view such sports free of charge. However Mr Campbell said Foxtel was "uniquely placed" to boost coverage of niche and emerging sports thanks to eight dedicated 24-hour channels as well as its ties to streaming platform Kayo.
"Obviously COVID-19 is impacting all sport at present," he said. "We are confident that women's and under-represented sport will be back and we can deliver strongly against the requirements of the grant again for 2020-21."
An injection of $7.5 million would provide some relief for Foxtel's balance sheet. The company has undergone three rounds of job cuts this year and has been offering customers significant discounts to compensate for the loss of live sport. The company has also sought a multimillion-dollar discount for the resumed NRL season.
A spokesman from the Communications department said the government would review Foxtel's latest expenditure breakdown, as well as its plan for the new financial year, in the coming months.
"The department will make an assessment as to the basis for payment following receipt of these reports," he said.

But Fox Sports boss Peter Campbell is confident Foxtel will pass the government's final assessment because the broadcaster had not only met but exceeded the 2019-20 benchmarks prior to COVID-19 shutdowns.
"Fox Sports has worked hard over the past year to produce, televise and build audiences for women's and under-represented sport in Australia, which have struggled to secure coverage on free-to-air television," he said.
"The careers of many athletes in under-represented sports, particularly female athletes, have flourished as a result of the coverage."
Some critics have argued the federal government should have distributed the $30 million grant to public broadcasters so Australians can view such sports free of charge. However Mr Campbell said Foxtel was "uniquely placed" to boost coverage of niche and emerging sports thanks to eight dedicated 24-hour channels as well as its ties to streaming platform Kayo.
"Obviously COVID-19 is impacting all sport at present," he said. "We are confident that women's and under-represented sport will be back and we can deliver strongly against the requirements of the grant again for 2020-21."
An injection of $7.5 million would provide some relief for Foxtel's balance sheet. The company has undergone three rounds of job cuts this year and has been offering customers significant discounts to compensate for the loss of live sport. The company has also sought a multimillion-dollar discount for the resumed NRL season.
A spokesman from the Communications department said the government would review Foxtel's latest expenditure breakdown, as well as its plan for the new financial year, in the coming months.
"The department will make an assessment as to the basis for payment following receipt of these reports," he said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Foxtel is "confident" it can fulfil its under-represented sport obligations even though the COVID-19 pandemic has decimated sporting codes across the country.
The pay TV provider is required to broadcast under-represented sports such as women's football, basketball and soccer as part of a $30 million federal government grant.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Aguero explains why deceptive Van Dijk is just so good</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has explained why Liverpool defender Virgil van Dijk is so difficult to play against.
The star attacker believes the centre-back is one of the best defenders in world football, citing the Dutchman's patient approach and imposing physical nature as just two of his world-class attributes.
Van Dijk signed for the Reds in January 2018 and transformed the backline, playing a huge part in the Champions League success last term and incredible Premier League run over the last two seasons.
"We all know Van Dijk is one of the best centre-backs in the world. He's strong, tall, has an incredible body," Aguero told El Chiringuito.
"He's very strong face to face, he plays with his body. Also, given he is so tall, he has those long legs...
"It looks like he isn't fast but he is, because of his long legs – he can reach everywhere. Two steps from him are 50 for me!
"What I like the most is the way he is so smart when defending.
"He's not anxious when marking, he's very careful and patient. That makes it difficult for many strikers.
"In my case, I'm pretty fast and I like to dribble, so I need the defender to come. But if he holds he can wait for help from another defender. He's very good at this."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sergio Aguero names surprising thing about Liverpool FC defender Virgil van Dijk</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester City star Sergio Aguero has explained why Liverpool centre-back Virgil van Dijk is one of the best defenders in the world and spoken about why it is so hard to play against him.
Van Dijk has been highly influential for Liverpool since moving to Anfield from Southampton in January 2018, playing a huge role in Liverpool's Champions League win in 2019 and this season's incredible run in the Premier League.
And Aguero says it is the defender's patient approach and imposing physical nature that make him a tricky proposition for attackers.
"We all know Van Dijk is one of the best centre-backs in the world. He's strong, tall, has an incredible body," Aguero told El Chiringuito.
"He's very strong face to face, he plays with his body. Also, given he is so tall, he has those long legs..."
Aguero suggested Van Dijk could surprise some players with his deceptive pace.
"It looks like he isn't fast but he is, because of his long legs – he can reach everywhere," Aguero added. "Two steps from him are 50 for me!
"What I like the most is the way he is so smart when defending. He's not anxious when marking, he's very careful and patient. That makes it difficult for many strikers.
"In my case, I'm pretty fast and I like to dribble, so I need the defender to come. But if he holds he can wait for help from another defender. He's very good at this."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sergio Aguero explains why Virgil van Dijk is so difficult for strikers to play against</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sergio Aguero says Virgil van Dijk's "long legs" make him a nightmare for forwards like him to face.
The Manchester City star has come up against Liverpool's Van Dijk in Premier League and Champions League tussles since the Dutchman joined the Reds from Southampton in January 2018.
City's all-time top goalscorer has kept up an impressive record of scoring seven times against Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium throughout his time in England, but incredibly he has never netted at Anfield across 11 appearances for City and former club Atletico Madrid.
Van Dijk is one of the key reasons for that record currently, and the Argentinean is full of praise for the defender.
"We all know Van Dijk is one of the best centre-backs in the world. He's strong, tall, has an incredible body," Aguero told El Chiringuito, via Goal.com.
"He's very strong face to face, he plays with his body. Also, given he is so tall, he has those long legs.
"It looks like he isn't fast but he is, because of his long legs – he can reach everywhere. Two steps from him are 50 for me!
"What I like the most is the way he is so smart when defending. He's not anxious when marking, he's very careful and patient. That makes it difficult for many strikers.
"In my case, I'm pretty fast and I like to dribble, so I need the defender to come. But if he holds he can wait for help from another defender. He's very good at this."
City had been due to face Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium on the first weekend on April in a match that could have seen the Reds take their Premier League crown, but it remains to be seen where and when the fixture will take place.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sergio Aguero explains what makes Virgil van Dijk “one of the best centre-backs in the world”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero has admitted that Liverpool superstar Virgil van Dijk is one of the best defenders in the world.
The Argentine explained that the Dutch captain’s ability to be patient in his approach, combined with his physical attributes, makes him the complete defender.
“We all know van Dijk is one of the best centre-backs in the world. He’s strong, tall, has an incredible body,” Aguero told El Chiringuito (via GOAL).
“He’s very strong face to face, he plays with his body. Also, given he is so tall, he has those long legs. It looks like he isn’t fast but he is, because of his long legs – he can reach everywhere. Two steps from him are 50 for me!

The City man has played against big Virg on a number of occasions, at club and international level, so you know he’s speaking from experience.
It’s nice to hear one big name in the beautiful game talk about another in such a way, putting rivalries aside.
Aguero is one of the best forwards the Premier League has seen, I’m not too shy to admit it, and he’s played against some of the best defenders in the world.
For him to talk about van Dijk (a star player of a rival club) like this is a breath of fresh air.
With the Dutchman at the heart of the team, Liverpool were on course to win the domestic title before the coronavirus pandemic brought the world to a standstill.
The No.4 has played a massive part in our success, with both him and Alisson completely transforming our defensive line-up ahead of our record sixth Champions League triumph last season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kevin De Bruyne eyes swift return to Premier League action</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin De Bruyne believes Manchester City could resume training in a fortnight, that the Premier League will finish the season despite the coronavirus crisis and that his club’s European ban will be overturned.
The midfielder is also pleased Belgium coach Roberto Martinez has extended his contract and says he is not interested in a move.
The 28-year-old, speaking to Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws, predicted the Premier League season will be concluded unlike the campaigns in France, the Netherlands, and his native Belgium.
“My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks,” he said. “The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give the people something, but it will be played without spectators I think.
“The financial aspect is far too important for the Premier League and if the season is not complete, it will cause serious problems.”
De Bruyne’s Manchester City teammate Sergio Aguero said last week he was scared about returning.
“Gosh, I don’t think they are really afraid for themselves, but for their families,” De Bruyne said. “That is the problem for many people. Everyone will be tested once we start playing again.”
De Bruyne had been in excellent form before the suspension.
“When the league resumes, I don’t really see it as an extension of the season. It feels more like the start of a new season,” the Belgian international said.
“I have never stood still for so long in my career but I’m not making a big deal out of it. Greater powers are at work and whatever is said and decided, I will agree with.”
On Manchester City’s ban from European club competition for the next two years due to breaches of financial fair play regulations, he said: “The club is appealing and has told us they are almost 100% sure that they are right. I trust the club.”
Martinez staying as coach of top-ranked Belgium was a logical move after the European Championship was postponed to next year, De Bruyne added.
“Maybe he would have gone off and done something different if the European Championship was played this year, but we have a project, which is far from complete. Stopping now would be weird.”
As to his own future, De Bruyne is very content at City.
“I play for one of the best teams in the world; I play in England, in my view, the best competition, and I like that,” he said. “It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that.”

The 28-year-old, speaking to Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws, predicted the Premier League season will be concluded unlike the campaigns in France, the Netherlands and his native Belgium.
"My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks," he said.
“The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give the people something, but it will be played without spectators I think.
“The financial aspect is far too important for the Premier League and if the season is not complete, it will cause serious problems.”
De Bruyne's Manchester City team mate Sergio Aguero said last week he was scared about returning.
"Gosh, I don't think they are really afraid for themselves, but for their families," De Bruyne said. “That is the problem for many people. Everyone will be tested once we start playing again.”
De Bruyne had been in excellent form before the suspension.
“When the league resumes, I don't really see it as an extension of the season. It feels more like the start of a new season," the Belgian international said.
"I have never stood still for so long in my career but I'm not making a big deal out of it. Greater powers are at work and whatever is said and decided, I will agree with."
On Manchester City’s ban from European club competition for the next two years due to breaches of financial fair play regulations, he said: “The club is appealing and have told us they are almost 100per cent sure that they are right. I trust the club.”
Martinez staying as coach of top-ranked Belgium was a logical move after the European Championship was postponed to next year, De Bruyne added.
“Maybe he would have gone off and done something different if the European Championship was played this year, but we have a project, which is far from complete. Stopping now would be weird.”
As to his own future, De Bruyne is very content at City.
“I play for one of the best teams in the world; I play in England, in my view, the best competition, and I like that," he said. "It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rugby: Warriors land in Australia after travel exemption</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TAMWORTH, Australia: The New Zealand Warriors arrived in Australia late Sunday (May 3) after the National Rugby League secured an exemption for the team to enter the country ahead of a planned resumption of the sport.
A charter plane carrying the Warriors landed in the rural town of Tamworth, about five hours drive from Sydney, at about 5:30pm.
The NRL's only international side will spend 14 days in quarantine in the town, Australia's country music hub, before competition restarts on May 28.
On Saturday Australian officials granted 36 players and staff a rare exemption from the country's ban on international arrivals, amid a slowdown in new coronavirus cases in Australia and New Zealand.
The Warriors were short two players after centre David Fusitu'a and hooker Nathaniel Roache stayed behind in Auckland.
The club said Fusitu'a had been given permission to delay his departure on compassionate grounds and Roache had been told to do the same after reporting he was unwell.
"We're totally satisfied Nate has had no contact with any other player or staff member at the club for several weeks and we're very comfortable we have abided by all policies and requirements," Warriors CEO Cameron George said.
The NRL season was suspended on March 24 after just two rounds amid a government shutdown of all non-essential gatherings in a bid to stem the spread of coronavirus.
Captain Roger Tuivasa-Sheck said he was excited to be reunited with his teammates but being separated from his family for a prolonged period would be challenging.
"That definitely was a tough part, saying goodbye to the family out there in the carpark and seeing my two kids go away," he said before boarding the flight.
"At this stage I've prepared to go for five months and go to work. If they could come over during a safe (period) then I'd be happy to bring them over because it'll be tough not to see them for that long."
Under plans thrashed out by the league and its broadcast partners this week, the season will be cut from 25 rounds to 20 - including the two already played - with a four-week playoff series ending in a Grand Final on Oct 25.
The three-match State of Origin series between New South Wales and Queensland, normally played mid-season, will shift to November for the first time.
The NRL has pushed hard to restart the league as Australia achieved success in curbing the spread of coronavirus, with the number of new daily cases slowing significantly in recent weeks allowing some restrictions to be lifted.
Australia has recorded 6,800 cases of COVID-19 and 95 deaths from the virus, while New Zealand has confirmed just over 1,100 cases and 20 deaths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Zealand's "Nomads" in Australia for rugby league season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">They’re being dubbed the New Zealand “Nomads,” and with good reason.
The New Zealand Warriors of the National Rugby League arrived at a small regional airport in New South Wales state on Sunday after being given permission to enter Australia despite a general ban on incoming travelers due to the coronavirus pandemic.
During a 14-day isolation period during which they’ll be able to train at Tamworth in the northwestern part of the state, they’ll likely move down to the Central Coast north of Sydney and play most of their matches in that area once the planned resumption of the season on May 28.
They’ll be without their families, for now, and will likely not be able to return to New Zealand until the NRL season ends. That’s nearly six months from now, in October.
Warriors chief executive Cameron George hopes families can follow in coming months, if current restrictions are relaxed. He said an in-house “well-being” officer will remain with the team during the season, while the club will ensure their families have support back in New Zealand.
The club also has the option to apply for a replacement if any player needs to return home prematurely.
“The squad we’re taking across is the intended squad that we play with for the duration of the season,” George told Australian Associated Press. “But if things change for personal reasons for individuals, on a case-by-case basis we can make application to the NRL, particularly on compassionate grounds.”
Two NRL rounds were played before the season was suspended on March 23 due to the pandemic. Australian media reported Saturday that the NRL plans a 20-round season in a revised schedule with the grand final championship to be played on Oct. 25.
The match venues have not been determined, although they are all expected to be played in New South Wales.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global season in 'embryo stage' for World Rugby chief Beaumont</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS: Newly re-elected World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said on Sunday (May 3) plans for a global season are in the early phases of discussion.
Former England captain Beaumont, 68, who beat ex-Argentina skipper Agustin Pichot to the position this weekend, said the coronavirus pandemic had encouraged the idea about northern and southern hemisphere campaigns aligning.
Reports in Britain's The Rugby Paper claim European sides and teams from countries such as World Cup winners South Africa could play at the same time of the year.
"These are very much in the embryo stage at the moment. People are talking because what has stimulated the debate is the position regarding this year," Beaumont said.
"The north go south in one month then immediately afterwards the sides would go north. We have to bear in mind that we have to take all stakeholders with us," he added.
Beaumont admitted to facing a challenge from various leagues, unions and domestic sides based in Europe.
"In the north we have to take the club game with you, we have to take the European game with us. We are in dialogue with all the stakeholders," he said.
"It's more problems in certain areas when you have more stakeholders."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Newly re-elected World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said on Sunday plans for a global season are in the early phases of discussion.

"In the north we have to take the club game with you, we have to take the European game with us. We are in dialogue with all the stakeholders," he said.
"It's more problems in certain areas when you have more stakeholders."
The prospect of a united season includes a global Nations Championship competition, which was scrapped in June as the Six Nations were worried about potential relegation from the top level of the game.
Beaumont said the new tournament would have multiple layers allowing sides to move between the competitions.
"My job is hopefully to get consensus from everybody in the game. I do think there is an appetite from the Six Nations to look at the Nations Championship," Beaumont said.
"Within that you could have competitions with all the countries who play in those windows and sitting below that you would have a subsidiary competitions for the emerging nations so they could play at the same time in another competition.
"You could well have promotion and relegation into that," he added.
In his first press conference since his re-election, Beaumont said he would like to change eligibility rules to permit individuals to represent different nations despite having already featured for another.
"It would allow players who might have played in a sevens tournament, they might have played an odd game for a Tier 1 nation, to go back," the former lock said.
"I think it gives an opportunity to help certain countries who are limited in their player resources.
"It has to be signed off by the council and both unions but it would improve the competitiveness of a Rugby World Cup without a doubt," he added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS
Newly re-elected World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said on Sunday plans for a global season are in the early phases of discussion.
Former England captain Beaumont, 68, who beat ex-Argentina skipper Agustin Pichot to the position this weekend, said the coronavirus pandemic had encouraged the idea about northern and southern hemisphere campaigns aligning.
Reports in Britain's The Rugby Paper claim European sides and teams from countries such as World Cup winners South Africa could play at the same time of the year.
"These are very much in the embryo stage at the moment. People are talking because what has stimulated the debate is the position regarding this year," Beaumont said.
"The north go south in one month then immediately afterwards the sides would go north. We have to bear in mind that we have to take all stakeholders with us," he added.
Beaumont admitted to facing a challenge from various leagues, unions and domestic sides based in Europe.
"In the north we have to take the club game with you, we have to take the European game with us. We are in dialogue with all the stakeholders," he said.
"It's more problems in certain areas when you have more stakeholders."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Global season in 'embryo stage' for World Rugby chief Beaumont</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS - Newly re-elected World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said on Sunday plans for a global season are in the early phases of discussion.

We are in dialogue with all the stakeholders," he said."It's more problems in certain areas when you have more stakeholders."The prospect of a united season includes a global Nations Championship competition, which was scrapped in June as the Six Nations were worried about potential relegation from the top level of the game.Beaumont said the new tournament would have multiple layers allowing sides to move between the competitions."My job is hopefully to get consensus from everybody in the game. I do think there is an appetite from the Six Nations to look at the Nations Championship," Beaumont said."Within that you could have competitions with all the countries who play in those windows and sitting below that you would have a subsidiary competitions for the emerging nations so they could play at the same time in another competition."You could well have promotion and relegation into that," he added.In his first press conference since his re-election, Beaumont said he would like to change eligibility rules to permit individuals to represent different nations despite having already featured for another."It would allow players who might have played in a sevens tournament, they might have played an odd game for a Tier 1 nation, to go back," the former lock said."I think it gives an opportunity to help certain countries who are limited in their player resource."It has to be signed off by the council and both unions but it would improve the competitiveness of a Rugby World Cup without a doubt," he added. - Nampa-AFP

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Bundesliga’s restart chances receive boost as German interior minister offers support</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Germany’s minister for the interior and sport said Sunday he supports a resumption of the country’s football season this month despite three people testing positive for coronavirus at Bundesliga club Cologne.
“I find the schedule proposed by the German league plausible and I support the restart in May,” Horst Seehofer told Bild newspaper, three days before a meeting of German authorities to discuss the issue.
The German Football League (DFL) backs matches resuming without spectators around mid-May, which would make it the first major European championship to make such a move.
The sports ministers of the 16 German states have also approved the DFL’s plans.
Seehofer, who plays a key government role on the issue as he holds several portfolios, has emphasised that the teams and players must respect several conditions.
“If there is a case of coronavirus in a team or its management, the club as a whole, and possibly also the team against which it last played, must go into quarantine for two weeks,” he said.
“There will continue therefore to be risks for the schedule of matches and for the standings,” if there is any contamination.
But he said clubs would not have any special testing privileges denied to the rest of the population. Some sides had suggested carrying out frequent tests of their players as a preventative measure against the virus.
Germany had reported more than 162,000 cases of Covid-19 as of Sunday, but its death toll of 6,649 remains considerably lower than that of comparable European countries, which are home to the continent’s other top football leagues.
In France, Paris Saint-Germain were declared Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced professional sport could not resume before September.
Meanwhile, English Premier League clubs on Friday reconfirmed their commitment to finish the season subject to coronavirus restrictions being lifted.
There are still 92 games remaining. They will be behind closed doors with neutral venues suggested.
Also on Friday Italy’s 20 Serie A clubs reiterated their unanimous desire to complete the season despite sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora saying the chances of restarting were “increasingly narrow”.
In Spain, La Liga is planning to start testing players for the coronavirus between Tuesday and Thursday next week, after which they would then be able to resume individual training programmes within 48 hours.
Clubs in Germany resumed training in early April while adhering to strict social distancing guidelines. However, the risk is still apparent.
Cologne announced Friday three people had tested positive for the virus and were to be placed into a 14-day quarantine at home.
Cologne midfielder Birger Verstraete, whose partner suffers from a heart condition, said it was “strange” the club had not put the whole squad in quarantine following the tests, as suggested by Seehofer.
“It’s not up to me to decide what to do in the Bundesliga but I can say my head is not in football” at the moment, he told Flemish TV station VTM. “The health of my family, of my partner is the priority.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">BREAKING: Bundesliga takes a major step closer to May return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Bundesliga is one step closer to a return to action in May after a significant sign of approval from a German government minister.
Horst Seehofer, the Minister of the Interior, Building and Community, has backed the Bundesliga’s plans to resume football safely amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Germany has done better than many countries in keeping the virus at bay, and it could be that that means games going on behind closed doors with strict hygiene measures in place is realistic.
“I find the DFL schedule plausible and support a restart in May,” said the 70-year-old.
However, he added: “I don’t want to be a spoil-game for football, but what applies to everyone also applies to football professionals. So there are risks for the game plan and the table. That requires a high level of discipline in coronary care. But I am in favour of it that we dare to try to make the game happen again.
“But it is also clear to me that there can be no privileges for the Bundesliga. It cannot be that professional players are tested more often than doctors, nurses or police officers who are in daily contact with people.
“And there shouldn’t be any bottlenecks in public health, for example in the tests or in the laboratories, because of a higher test volume in sports. That is the basic requirement for me.”
This seems like a positive step in the right direction and fans of the Premier League will hope this means we can see a return for English football this summer as well.
The top flight and the football league have been postponed since March, but UK lockdown restrictions are expected to ease from May 7 onwards, with recent reports suggesting Premier League games could be back by June 12.

"I find the schedule proposed by the German league plausible and I support the restart in May," Horst Seehofer told Bild newspaper, three days before a meeting of German authorities to discuss the issue.
The German Football League (DFL) backs a resumption of matches without spectators around mid-May, which would make it the first major European championship to make such a move.
Seehofer, who plays a key government role on the issue as he holds several portfolios, has emphasised that the teams and players must respect several conditions.

"If there is a case of coronavirus in a team or its management, the club as a whole, and eventually also the team against which it last played, must go into quarantine for two weeks," he said.
"There will continue therefore to be risks for the schedule of matches and for the classification," if there is any contamination.
But he said clubs would not have any special testing privileges denied to the rest of the population. Some sides had suggested carrying out frequent tests of their players as a preventative measure against the virus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Influential German minister backs Bundesliga restart in May</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Germany's minister for the interior and sport said Sunday he supports a resumption of the country's football season this month despite three people testing positive for coronavirus at Bundesliga club Cologne.
"I find the schedule proposed by the German league plausible and I support the restart in May," Horst Seehofer told Bild newspaper, three days before a meeting of German authorities to discuss the issue.
The German Football League (DFL) backs matches resuming without spectators around mid-May, which would make it the first major European championship to make such a move. The sports ministers of the 16 German states have also approved the DFL's plans.
Seehofer, who plays a key government role on the issue as he holds several portfolios, has emphasised that the teams and players must respect several conditions.
"If there is a case of coronavirus in a team or its management, the club as a whole, and possibly also the team against which it last played, must go into quarantine for two weeks," he said. "There will continue therefore to be risks for the schedule of matches and for the standings," if there is any contamination.
But he said clubs would not have any special testing privileges denied to the rest of the population. Some sides had suggested carrying out frequent tests of their players as a preventative measure against the virus.
Germany had reported 162,496 cases of COVID-19 as of Sunday, but its death toll of 6,649 remains considerably lower than that of comparable European countries, which are home to the continent's other top football leagues.

In France, Paris Saint-Germain were declared Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced professional sport could not resume before September.
Meanwhile, English Premier League clubs on Friday reconfirmed their commitment to finish the season subject to coronavirus restrictions being lifted. There are still 92 games remaining. They will be behind closed doors with neutral venues suggested.
Also on Friday Italy's 20 Serie A clubs reiterated their unanimous desire to complete the season despite sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora saying the chances of restarting were "increasingly narrow".
In Spain, La Liga is planning to start testing players for the coronavirus between Tuesday and Thursday next week, after which they would then be able to resume individual training programmes within 48 hours.
Clubs in Germany resumed training in early April while adhering to strict social distancing guidelines. However, the risk is still apparent. Cologne announced Friday three people had tested positive for the virus and were to be placed into a 14-day quarantine at home.
Cologne midfielder Birger Verstraete, whose partner suffers from a heart condition, said it was "strange" the club had not put the whole squad in quarantine following the tests, as suggested by Seehofer.
"It's not up to me to decide what to do in the Bundesliga but I can say my head is not in football" at the moment, he told Flemish TV station VTM. "The health of my family, of my partner is the priority."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BRUSSELS: Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne believes the Premier League season will be finished despite the coronavirus pandemic "because the financial aspect is far too important".
"My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks. The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something. I think this season will be finished," De Bruyne told Belgian daily Het Laatste Nieuws.
"The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems," he added.
Clubs were presented with the league's "Project Restart" plans at a meeting on Friday (May 1) and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-2020 season must be played at neutral venues.
De Bruyne also said he was optimistic about City's participation in next season's Champions League. UEFA has banned the club from European competition for the next two years for "serious breaches" of financial fair-play rules.
"The club told us they're going to appeal and that they're almost certain to get their way. I'm waiting to see what happens, but I trust my club," said De Bruyne.
The 28-year-old Belgium international admitted he would be forced to consider his City future if the ban was upheld.
"Once we know more, I will make a decision. Two years without playing in Europe would be long but in the case of one year I might see," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man City star Kevin De Bruyne makes prediction for Premier League return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester City star Kevin De Bruyne says he thinks the Premier League season will get underway again soon.
The Belgian midfielder has admitted that a two-year ban from European football for City could cause him to consider his future at the club, but says a one-year break could be manageable.
City were going well before the postponement of football this season, picking up a win away to Real Madrid in the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie.
They are some way off Liverpool in the Premier League, but have already won the Carabao Cup and are also through to the FA Cup quarter-finals where they were scheduled to face Newcastle.
And De Bruyne believes it will not be too long before the players are back competing - with parties reportedly hoping for a return on June 8.
"My feeling says that we may be able to train again within two weeks,” De Bruyne told HLN. "The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something.
"Everything will be finished without fans, I think. That is not really interesting for anyone, but this season will be finished.
"The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems."
City teammate Sergio Aguero said he and other players were scared of the prospect of returning to football too soon, and De Bruyne says he understands, but does not feel financial concerns are being placed ahead of players' health.
"[Financial concerns above players' health?] Not so much. Everyone will be tested once we start playing again," he added.
"Gosh, I don't think they are really afraid of themselves, but of their family. That is mainly the problem for many people."

Prime minister Giuseppe Conte said last Sunday that individual training could start on May 4 and team training on May 18, only for sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora to say that athletes in individual sports could start training from May 4 and those in team sports must wait until May 18.
Spadafora's statement drew criticism and Serie A club Sassuolo on Saturday said they would allow their players to use their facilities from Monday.
Bologna, also based in the Emilia Romagna region where special permission was given for athletes in team sports to take part in training sessions on an individual basis from May 4, said players could resume training on Tuesday.
The region of Campania, which includes Naples, has also said that players can begin training. Napoli have yet to comment.
"Athletes and non athletes, of non individual disciplines, just like any citizen, are allowed to practise individual sporting activities, in private and public areas, in respect of the interpersonal safety distance of at least two metres and in respect of the ban to gather in any form," the interior ministry said in a letter to local authorities.
Serie A has been suspended since March 9 and the league and the Italian football federation (FIGC) both want to complete the season, although the Italian government says it has not yet decided whether it will give its permission to do so.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brett Lee and Dale Steyn give Rohit Sharma sleepless nights</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: India limited-overs vice-captain Rohit Sharma named the most difficult bowlers he has come face-to-face over the years in international cricket. Rohit has revealed he was troubled by former Australia fast-bowler Brett Lee’s express pace during his early days while dealing with South Africa speedster Dale Steyn’s swing felt like a ‘nightmare’ to him.
“One bowler is Brett Lee because he didn’t let me sleep the previous night on my first tour to Australia in 2007, as I was thinking how to play this bowler who bowls in excess of 150 kmph,” Rohit said during Star Sports show Cricket Connected.
“In 2007, Brett Lee was at his peak. I used to watch him closely and noticed that he was consistently bowling at the speed of around 150-155 kmph. The thought of a youngster like me facing that kind of speed took away my sleep.
“I have two favourite bowlers who I never wanted to face, one was Brett Lee and the other was Dale Steyn. I never wanted to face Steyn because playing pace and swing at the same time was a nightmare, it was just unreal,” he added.
Rohit also lavished praise on current Australia fast-bowler Josh Hazlewood, whom he referred to as being very disciplined with his line and length. India are currently slated to travel Down Under later this year for a Test series and Rohit stated he will have to ‘mentally prepare’ himself for the prospect of coming up against Hazlewood.
“Currently, someone whom I don’t want to face in Test cricket would be Josh Hazlewood because he’s disciplined and does not move away from that length,” Rohit said.
“He does not give you loose balls. I have watched him enough to understand that. I know for a fact that if I have to go to Australia to play a Test, then I have to be mentally prepared to be disciplined while facing Josh.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rohit Sharma on the toughest bowlers he has faced, winning World Cups for fans and more</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The thought of standing up to Brett Lee’s thunderbolts gave him sleepless nights when he first toured Australia while the pace and swing generated by Dale Steyn was also a big challenge, said Indian cricket star Rohit Sharma.
Among the current lot of bowlers, Josh Hazlewood is one speedster Rohit doesn’t enjoy facing in Tests. The white-ball format vice captain said he will have to be mentally prepared to face Hazlewood when (and if) India tour Australia for a Test series later this year.

Asked to name the toughest pacers he has faced so far, Rohit said, “One bowler is Brett Lee because he didn’t let me sleep the previous night on my first tour to Australia in 2007, as I was thinking how to play this bowler who bowls in excess of 150 kmph.”
“In 2007, Brett Lee was at his peak. I used to watch him closely and noticed that he was consistently bowling at the speed of around 150-155 kmph. The thought of a youngster like me facing that kind of speed took away my sleep,” Rohit said of the former Australian pacer on Star Sports’ ‘Cricket Connected’.
Rohit said South African pace great Dale Steyn has also given him nightmares because of his ability to swing the ball at great speed.
“I have two retired favourite bowlers who I never wanted to face, one was Brett Lee and the other was Dale Steyn. I never wanted to face Steyn because playing pace and swing at the same time was a nightmare, it was just unreal.”
Since making his debut in 2007 as a precocious talent, Rohit has gone on to become one of the world’s most prolific batsmen, and is famed for his exploits in limited overs cricket as an opener. He has racked up 29 ODI hundreds and six centuries in Test cricket, besides four three-figure mark in the T20 Internationals.
“Currently, someone whom I don’t want to face in Test cricket would be Josh Hazlewood because he’s disciplined and does not move away from that length. He does not give you loose balls,” he said.
“I have watched him enough to understand that. I know for a fact that if I have to go to Australia to play a Test, then I have to be mentally prepared to be disciplined while facing Josh,” said the scorer of three double hundreds in ODIs.

Saying he is not lucky as the Australians to have a house with a backyard where he can have a hit, Rohit said he is managing to get some physical training done in the balcony of his apartment in Mumbai.
“I missing hitting the ball, because you know I like hitting them big and so this space is not enough. I just can’t wait to go out there and start hitting balls again,” Rohit added.
Speaking about the importance of fans in Indian cricket, Rohit hoped to give them moments to cherish soon.
“In the next few years there are three different World cups, hopefully we can win maybe two of them... or why not, all three and give the fans moments worth cherishing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Had difficulties in facing Dale Steyn and Brett Lee, reveals Rohit Sharma</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rohit Sharma’s god-gifted ability with the bat - with him having an extra second to play his shots - has meant that the right-hander has had an uncanny knack of playing fast bowlers with ease and this has been a part of his batting ever since his younger days. His unbeaten 79 against Australia in the World T20 in 2010, on a wicket with extreme pace and bounce, almost served as a sign of things to come. 
Recalling his embryonic days in international cricket, the Mumbaikar, who made his international debut in 2007, revealed that Dale Steyn and Brett Lee were the fast bowlers who troubled him the most, due to the sheer pace they brought to the table. Rohit further added that he admired both the bowlers.
"When I came into the side, the fastest bowler in the world used to be Brett Lee. In my debut ODI series, I went to Ireland to face South Africa, and Dale Steyn was pretty quick then as well. When I started playing, I really liked Lee and Steyn, I had difficulties in facing them as well,” Rohit told Shami in an Instagram chat.
When asked about who he liked amongst the current crop of pacers, the opener was quick to take the name of South Africa’s Kagiso Rabada and Australia’s Josh Hazlewood and stated that he admired the consistency and discipline of the latter.
"From the current lot, Rabada is a good bowler, I really like Josh Hazelwood as well, he bowls with great discipline," Rohit added.
There are only handful of batsmen in world cricket who have reached the coveted 200-run mark in ODI cricket, but having achieved the feat thrice, Rohit, unlike any other batsman, has the privilege of choosing his ‘favourite’ double ton. However, when asked to pick one out of the three, the 33-year-old said that he could not single out one and stated that all three double-tons were equally special to him.
"My first double century against Australia has to be my favourite innings, it was very special, my second double hundred, 264 against Sri Lanka is also a special inning for me, the third double century came on the day on my marriage anniversary, so all three innings are very special for me".

    <h5 class="mb-1">IPL is where I get most goosebumps, want to retire in KKR jersey: Andre Russell</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Big-hitting West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell says playing for Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL is where he gets the “most goosebumps” and wants to remain in that side till his very last game in the league.
The 32-year-old was speaking to KKR’s official ‘Knights Unplugged’ online show. The Jamaican is currently at home as the IPL has been suspended indefinitely owing to the Covid-19pandemic.
“Let me confess something, IPL is where I get the most goosebumps. I get that in CPL (Caribbean Premier League) as well but when it comes to playing in IPL, especially Eden Gardens, there is no comparison,” Russell said referring to his team’s home ground in Kolkata.
“…the welcome I get, that’s love. It puts pressure on me but it’s good pressure,” he added.
Russell said the Eden crowd has been supportive towards him even when he hasn’t exactly delivered and that’s why it’s the one place, he would like to call it quits as and when he does.
“I would love to be at KKR until that moment when I say that this will be my last IPL. I have been at KKR for six seasons and I enjoyed every bit of it,” he said.
“I know even if I fail two games straight, when I come out to bat for the third game, it is the same deafening reaction I will get from the crowd. It’s always a welcoming thing,” he said.
Hopeful of playing in the IPL some time this year, Russell also spoke about dealing with being away from his new-born daughter and wife. Both were in Miami when the coronavirus-forced travel restrictions came into force globally.
“She (his daughter) and Jassym, they are both in Miami. I stay connected to them and talk to them. I wish I could have them here, but with all these travel restrictions, we cannot do anything,” he said.
“It’s not really a situation anyone would want to be in. This is affecting the world, it’s affecting me, preventing me from hitting sixes. Hope this thing calms down in a month or two and we can go back to normal life again.”

“Let me confess something, IPL is where I get the most goosebumps. I get that in CPL (Caribbean Premier League) as well but when it comes to playing in IPL, especially Eden Gardens, there is no comparison,” Russell said referring to his team’s home ground in Kolkata.
“The welcome I get, that’s love. It puts pressure on me but it’s good pressure,” he added.
Russell said the Eden crowd has been supportive towards him even when he hasn’t exactly delivered and that’s why it’s the one place, he would like to call it quits as and when he does.
“I would love to be at KKR until that moment when I say that this will be my last IPL. I have been at KKR for six seasons and I enjoyed every bit of it,” he said.
“I know even if I fail two games straight, when I come out to bat for the third game, it is the same deafening reaction I will get from the crowd. It’s always a welcoming thing,” he said.
Hopeful of playing in the IPL some time this year, Russell also spoke about dealing with being away from his newborn daughter and wife. Both were in Miami when the coronavirus-forced travel restrictions came into force globally.
“She [his daughter] and Jassym, they are both in Miami. I stay connected to them and talk to them. I wish I could have them here, but with all these travel restrictions, we cannot do anything,” he said.
“It’s not really a situation anyone would want to be in. This is affecting the world, it’s affecting me, preventing me from hitting sixes. Hope this thing calms down in a month or two and we can go back to normal life again.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">When I Walk Out to Bat For KKR at Eden Gardens, I Get Goosebumps: Russell</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">T20 superstar Andre Russell has said the experience of playing for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) at Eden Gardens is incomparable and he loves the adulation from the home fans.

“Let me confess something – IPL is where I get the most goosebumps when I am playing cricket,” Russell told KKR Knights Unplugged. “I get that in the Caribbean Premier League as well, but when it comes to playing in the IPL, especially at Eden Gardens, there is no comparison to that crowd.” Also Read - Imran Tahir Heaps Praise on MS Dhoni, Says My Son Will Relish The Time He Spent With CSK Skipper After Growing up
“When I walk out before facing a ball, I have goosebumps all over me because of the welcome that I get. That’s pure love, and yes it puts pressure on me. But it’s a good kind of pressure,” he said.
More often than not, Russell finds himself batting at a time when his team needs quick runs – be it when they are setting a target or chasing one. In those moments, the reaction of the crowd adds to the pressure but he enjoys it and it eventually spurs him to do better.
“When Kolkata needs 12 or 13 runs per over, with only 5 overs to go — I love those moments, and the crowd really allows me to do what I need to do. I get a feeling they are telling me: ‘Listen, we have got your back, so just go out and do your business,'” he said.
“If everyone was sad, and there was no noise, no entrance, that would maybe make me feel the pressure more. But I know even if I fail two games straight, when I come out to bat for the third game, it is the same deafening reaction I will get from the crowd. It’s always a welcoming thing,” he added.
In his IPL career, Russell has so far played 64 matches, scored 1400 runs and taken 55 wickets as well.
The 32-year-old hinted he hopes to finish his career at KKR. “Just like players in big (football) leagues like English Premier League, or the Basketball guys (at NBA) retiring from the sport say ‘okay, this is my last game’ and they wave goodbye to the crowd — I imagine I would love to be at KKR until that moment in my career,” said Russell.
“I’d say, Shah Rukh (KKR co-owner), all the KKR staff, everyone. This will be my last IPL and the last home game playing in Kolkata.’ It would be such an emotional moment. I sometimes watch videos and I see footballers crying and I’m wondering if I would actually cry, but that’s the special thing about playing at a club for so long and getting so attached,” he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Liverpool should be awarded Premier League title, says Houllier</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier believes his old club should be awarded the Premier League title even if the season is not completed because of the COVID-19 crisis.
Liverpool are 25 points clear at the top with nine games left to play in the Premier League, which has been on hold since March 9 as the novel coronavirus spread across the globe.
According to Houllier, who led Liverpool to FA Cup and UEFA Cup glory in 2001 during his six-year spell at Anfield, Juergen Klopp's team would be deserved champions.
Asked if they should be awarded their first top-flight title since 1990, the former France coach told TalkSport: "Yeah. That’s what they did in France. They gave it to Paris St Germain. They had a 12-point lead and I think Liverpool needed just two games to win the title.
"If there was a difference of maybe two or three points then you could argue it takes some chances away from teams behind but 25 points there is no way they wouldn’t be champions. They deserve it."
Houllier, now an adviser to Olympique Lyonnais president Jean-Michel Aulas, added that the Premier League should follow the government's lead on whether to resume.
"I think they should follow the government’s rules. If the government decides we stop then we have to abide by that," he explained.
"Second, maybe wait a little bit because we don’t know what it’s going to be like in a fortnight or in three weeks time." (Reporting by Julien Pretot; Editing by Ed Osmond)

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Vancouver Canucks general manager Jim Benning and his NHL counterparts usually have the luxury of a picture that's mostly come into focus.
A normal draft year will see scouts and executives spend the spring crisscrossing Europe and North America collecting every scrap of information possible on hockey's next crop of high-end talent.
They watch games, talk to those closest to the prospects, conduct in-person interviews with players and examine physical testing results. The under-18 world championships, Canadian Hockey League playoffs and Memorial Cup are all on the list of must-attend events.
The circumstances surrounding a 2020 NHL draft and the COVID-19 pandemic, however, aren't anything resembling normal.
The culmination of junior seasons were cancelled, tournaments were nixed and the league's annual combine -- a crucial exercise where teenage hopefuls are put through physical exercises and mental hula hoops -- was postponed and looks unlikely to go ahead.
There's talk the NHL could hold its draft online in the first part of next month even though the 2019-20 season has yet to be completed. But that's far from the only unique aspect for teams poised to make franchise-altering decisions in this unprecedented era of social distancing.
In short, the book on many of the youngsters in question won't be fully written.
"It's nice to see how players perform in the playoffs," Benning said. "That's a big part, I think, of finding players that are winners ... when it gets hard in the playoffs, if they step up. We're going to miss out on all that.
"We're trying to do the best we can under the circumstances to get to know the players and try to figure out what they're going to be in three or four years time."
Scouts logged plenty of kilometres until the novel coronavirus outbreak brought hockey to a halt in mid-March, but there was still lots of work to do, especially outside the top half of an opening round headlined by Alexis Lafreniere and Quinton Byfield.
"Probably not as complete as it would be had it been a normal ending to the season," Columbus Blue Jackets GM Jarmo Kekalainen said of his team's eventual list for the draft, which was originally scheduled for June 26-27 in Montreal. "You're running around trying to (watch) the top guys one last time or guys that you had missed earlier in the year. Now we're watching tape instead.
"It will be different coverage, not as good coverage ... that's the reason why we have the amateur scouts on the road. It'll be a little bit different. It'll be interesting and we'll see how it goes."
Winnipeg Jets GM Kevin Cheveldayoff said clubs will be forced to lean heavily on the work put in from September through early March heading into what's expected to be a virtual draft similar to the one held by the NFL last month.
"We've always tried to keep a handle on times-seen of players ... try to have a good balance," he said. "Scouts, by their nature, live in the moment and go to the game and just hope the guy's not hurt. They've always had to adjust.
"The interesting thing is we're all in this same boat together. We all don't have to pick or choose which game you're going to, even though you'd love to be picking or choosing which game you're going to."
The NHL usually puts more than 100 draft prospects through physical testing at the combine next month. It's also an opportunity for teams to hold one-on-one meetings in hopes of getting to know the player on a more intimate different level.
Like businesses, families and friends separated during the pandemic, team front offices are getting creative with video conferencing platforms, but there will be blind spots in other areas.
"The biggest thing losing the combine is physical testing," Calgary Flames GM Brad Treliving said. "They all need to get stronger, but you get a sense of their frames and who needs what in terms of physical maturation."
While clubs will be at an obvious disadvantage, Toronto Maple Leafs goalie Jack Campbell said some players could be in the same boat, especially with the need for remote interviews.
"I just enjoy face-to-face no matter what scenario it is," said the 11th pick in the 2010 draft. "It's just more real, I guess. But you've got to just make the most of what we're given right now.
"It's definitely a unique process for the prospects and the organizations."
One that all involved, like the rest of society right now, will do their best to navigate.
"The work is still getting done," Treliving said. "Ultimately you're going to make decisions based on the information you have."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crystal Palace chief defends Premier League's coronavirus stance with reasons to resume season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has defended the Premier League's attempts to get the season back up and running amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Top-flight chiefs met on Friday to discuss their controversial 'Project Restart' proposal, with clubs committed to finishing the season when some social restrictions are relaxed.
It is understood the league is still working towards a best-case scenario of play being able to resume from the week beginning June 8.
Parish wrote in his column in The Sunday Times that he would respect if the nation decided that it was inappropriate for football to return, but he argued that it would help no-one if football or any industry "come out the other side in a worse state than we otherwise could have".
And, in an honest take on the crisis facing football, the Eagles chief has also explained why he is backing the proposal to get the campaign back underway - when it is safe to do so.
He said: "Isn’t it all just about the money? Well, not entirely. I want to complete the competition for reasons of sporting integrity.
"I want to crown Liverpool champions and give every other club a fair crack at the best league position they can achieve.
"I certainly don’t want to have difficult conversations about curtailing, voiding and points per game. The ramifications of each are complex and could involve legal challenges that run on for months, if not years.
"But, yes, it is partly about the money. And we should all care about the money. I’ll tell you why. Nobody wins if the Premier League receives less money. Nobody. We are already facing losses no one can quantify — and if we don’t finish the season we are entering uncharted waters."
Parish added that nobody would benefit if Premier League clubs faced major financial shortfalls by not completing the season.
"Football is one of the most efficient tax-generating industries in Britain: we pay the players a lot but 50 per cent goes straight back into the public purse," he said.
"Overall we pay about £3.3 billion in tax every year and it is the Premier League that largely funds the whole football pyramid."
He stated that the Premier League pays about £400million each year to the English Football League, £25 million to non-league and grassroots football, while suppliers, contractors and services depend on the clubs in their communities.
He added: "Some Premier League clubs are already warning they face crisis if they cannot get back to playing, and in the EFL many more may face extinction."
Parish also argued the return of Premier League football could boost the mental health of the nation and help define the "new normal" for other industries.
Parish said: "Football cannot occupy any paramedic or ambulance that the NHS needs. We must do our best not to create a public-order issue with supporters attempting to get close to grounds. Perhaps most importantly, we cannot take testing capacity from one person in greater need."
But he added: "I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the 'new normal' might look for a lot of working environments.
"Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis.
"In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. Football is meaningless - but it is magnificently meaningless. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?"

But he added: "I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the 'new normal' might look for a lot of working environments.
"Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis. In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. Football is meaningless — but it is magnificently meaningless. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?"
Parish claimed that player welfare and safety proposals would "render Premier League football one of the safest places in society to co-exist, much safer than a journey to the supermarket at present".
And he added that nobody would benefit if Premier League clubs faced major financial shortfalls by not completing the season.
"Football is one of the most efficient tax-generating industries in Britain: we pay the players a lot but 50 per cent goes straight back into the public purse," he said. "Overall we pay about £3.3 billion in tax every year and it is the Premier League that largely funds the whole football pyramid."
He stated that the Premier League pays about £400million each year to the English Football League, £25 million to non-league and grassroots football, while suppliers, contractors and services depend on the clubs in their communities.
He added: "Some Premier League clubs are already warning they face crisis if they cannot get back to playing, and in the EFL many more may face extinction."
The PA news agency understands clubs were told on Friday that limiting action to a handful of selected stadiums was the only way it would be possible to complete the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season for safety reasons.
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has some reservations about that prospect, fearing it could affect the "integrity" of the competition.
Furthermore, PA understands the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing – which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Crystal Palace chairman: Premier League return will boost spirits</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has argued the return of Premier League football could boost the mental health of the nation and help define the “new normal” for other industries.
Parish defended attempts to get the season back up and running amid the coronavirus pandemic, stressing not doing so would be a major financial blow to taxpayers and the wider football community.
The Premier League met on Friday to discuss ‘Project Restart’ with clubs committed to finishing the season when some social restrictions are relaxed. It is understood the league is still working towards a best-case scenario of play being able to resume from the week beginning June 8th.
Parish wrote in his column in The Sunday Times that he would respect if the nation decided that it was inappropriate for football to return, but he argued that it would help no-one if football or any industry “come out the other side in a worse state than we otherwise could have”.
Parish said: “Football cannot occupy any paramedic or ambulance that the NHS needs. We must do our best not to create a public-order issue with supporters attempting to get close to grounds. Perhaps most importantly, we cannot take testing capacity from one person in greater need.”
But he added: “I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the ‘new normal’ might look for a lot of working environments.

Parish claimed that player welfare and safety proposals would “render Premier League football one of the safest places in society to co-exist, much safer than a journey to the supermarket at present”.
And he added that nobody would benefit if Premier League clubs faced major financial shortfalls by not completing the season.

According to media reports in the UK, clubs were told on Friday that limiting action to a handful of selected stadiums was the only way it would be possible to complete the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season for safety reasons.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cristiano Ronaldo 'stuck in Madeira' as private jet grounded in Madrid</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cristiano Ronaldo is reportedly stuck in his native Madeira and won't be able to get back to Turin any time soon, as Juventus prepare to return to training on Monday.
With the Italian government having given Serie A clubs the green light to return ahead of the resumption of the football season amid the coronavirus crisis, Ronaldo had been due to fly back to Turin on Sunday evening.
But the Portuguese news channel TVI, via the Mail Online, report that the 35-year-old's private jet has been unable to take off from Madrid due to Spanish travel restrictions.
Ronaldo had planned for his £30m Gulfstream G650 jet to pick him from his home island off the coast of Portugal, and then to transfer him direct to Turin in preparation for the beginning of Juve's plans to resume the 2019/20 season.
But despite the plane trying to take off three times, Ronaldo may now be forced to stay in Madeira for several more days before being able to fly back to Italy.
The Italian government had initially banned all team sports until May 18, but brought forward their decision by two weeks after some regional assemblies relaxed the rules in their areas.
However any player returning to Italy from another country, such as Ronaldo, will be forced to quarantine for 14 days upon landing, meaning he will now miss the start of Juve's training.
Sassuolo became the first Serie A side to announce that they will be returning to training on Monday following a relaxation of rules in the Emilia-Romagna region, with Bologna, Parma and SPAL soon following suit.
A Sassuolo statement read: "Players will only be allowed access to the pitches in compliance with rules of social distancing, while access to the Sports Center will be prohibited.
"The individual sessions, which will take place during the mornings from Monday to Friday, with the use of three fields, with six players per hour (one player for each half of the pitch), will not be attended by the technical staff, while an emergency health supervision will be guaranteed."

Agent Bryan Ehrlich confirmed the deal Sunday. Patterson started all 26 games for the Wolverines over the past two seasons after transferring from Mississippi.
Patterson threw for 3,061 yards with 23 touchdowns and eight interceptions last season. He threw 45 touchdown passes in his two years at Michigan. Patterson passed for 131 yards in the Senior Bowl.
Patterson started 10 games at Ole Miss but transferred after the school was hit by NCAA sanctions. He was granted eligibility at Michigan in 2018 without sitting out a year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kansas City Chiefs sign undrafted Michigan QB Patterson</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Kansas City Chiefs have agreed to terms with undrafted Michigan quarterback Shea Patterson.
The deal was announced by Patterson's agent, Bryan Ehrlich.
Patterson began his collegiate career at Mississippi before transferring to Michigan following his sophomore season in 2017 when Ole Miss were hit by NCAA sanctions.
He was able to play at Michigan immediately without needing to sit out a year, and started all 26 games for the Wolverines over the past two seasons, throwing for 5,661 yards with 45 touchdowns and 15 interceptions.
Patterson fell off most teams' draft boards, however, due to some inconsistent play in 2019 and a pedestrian performance in this year’s Senior Bowl, passing for 130 yards with a touchdown and an interception.
With Patrick Mahomes and backup Chad Henne set at QB for the reigning Super Bowl champions, Patterson will likely be competing with former XFL quarterback Jordan Ta'amu for the number three job.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Undrafted Michigan QB Patterson reaches deal with Chiefs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) - Former Michigan quarterback Shea Patterson has agreed to terms with the Kansas City Chiefs as an undrafted free agent.
Agent Bryan Ehrlich confirmed the deal Sunday. Patterson started all 26 games for the Wolverines over the past two seasons after transferring from Mississippi.
Patterson threw for 3,061 yards with 23 touchdowns and eight interceptions last season. He threw 45 touchdown passes in his two years at Michigan. Patterson passed for 131 yards in the Senior Bowl.
Patterson started 10 games at Ole Miss but transferred after the school was hit by NCAA sanctions. He was granted eligibility at Michigan in 2018 without sitting out a year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Alex Smith: ‘So absurd’ Colin Kaepernick doesn’t have NFL job</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The quarterback who lost his starting job to Colin Kaepernick finds it “absurd” that Kaepernick has been out of a job since 2016.
Alex Smith started the first nine games of the 49ers’ season in 2012 before sustaining a concussion that opened the door for Kaepernick to step in at quarterback. Even after Smith got healthy, the 49ers stuck with Kapernick and rode him to the Super Bowl, where they lost to the Ravens.
“It was hard to see that trajectory because he was playing so good and doing things that nobody had done,” Smith said Friday on “The Dan Le Batard Show” on ESPN Radio. “I think he still holds the single-game rushing record for a quarterback. It was crazy.
“So with that said, it was so absurd, I think equally, that it was only a few years later when you’re like, ‘This guy doesn’t have a job.’ That was hard to imagine, still is. A guy with his ability and trajectory that all of a sudden wasn’t playing.”
Eight years later, the 35-year-old Smith is on the comeback trail after breaking his leg in 2018 and suffering multiple infections that threatened to have his leg amputated.
The 32-year-old Kaepernick, meanwhile, has not played since 2016. During that season, he regularly knelt during the national anthem to protest racial inequality, social injustice and police brutality.
Kapernick has since filed a lawsuit against the NFL, alleging that he has been blackballed from playing in the league again. He held a workout last November for teams, but it did not result in anyone signing him.
In six seasons with the 49ers, Kaepernick completed 59.8 percent of his passes for 12,271 yards, 72 touchdowns and 30 interceptions while rushing for 2,300 yards and 13 touchdowns.
“From a pure football standpoint, Kaep was a great teammate,” Smith said. “The run he had [in 2012] and the ability was crazy, it’s crazy good. You could certainly see a guy that, [with] that kind of running ability and also being able to throw the football and making plays, really in his first chunk of playing time — the trajectory he was on was absurd. A crazy gifted guy, really, really competitive, really tough when I was with him.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Alex Smith Has Strong Comment On Former NFL QB Colin Kaepernick</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Alex Smith may have lost his starting job to Colin Kaepernick in 2012, but he isn’t holding any grudges. Quite the opposite, actually.
In a recent interview with ESPN Radio, Smith says he finds it “absurd” that Kaepernick doesn’t have an NFL job right now. Smith pointed to how good he was with the 49ers for years and how it’s strange to see someone with his abilities out of work.
“It was hard to kind of see that trajectory because he was playing so good, and doing things nobody had done,” Smith said, per USA Today. “I think he still holds the single-game rushing record for a quarterback. It was crazy.
“So with that said, it was so absurd — I think equally — that it was only a few years later when you’re like, ‘This guy doesn’t have a job.’ That was hard to imagine. It still is, a guy with his ability and his trajectory that all of a sudden wasn’t playing.”
It’s very rare that a player makes it back into the NFL after an absence of at least three years. And at 32 years of age, his window to play at a high level could be closing for good soon.
Kaepernick attempted to have a public workout for NFL teams last season to show he’s still fit. But nothing solid from any teams ever came from it.
Ultimately, Kaepernick has support from some players and fans. But until he gets it from NFL front offices, it won’t do him much good.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Alex Smith Calls Ex-49ers QB Colin Kaepernick Not Having NFL Job ‘Absurd’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Alex Smith is a supporter of Colin Kaepernick.
Smith held an interview on “The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz” on ESPN Radio on Friday and not only spoke about his injury that he is still rehabbing, but addressed his time playing with Colin Kaepernick in San Francisco.
The fact that Kaepernick still doesn’t have a job in the league, Smith said, is “absurd.”
During 10 starts in the 2012 regular season and playoffs, Kaepernick threw for 2,406 yards, 14 touchdowns and five interceptions while also racking up 502 rushing yards. The 49ers would go on to trade Smith to the Chiefs the following offseason.
After making it to another NFC Championship Game in Kaepernick’s first full season as the starter, the team would not qualify for the postseason in his final three years with the team.
Despite what people say, Kaepernick didn’t enter the 2016 season as the starter, not because he lost his job, but because he was working his way back from an injury to his left shoulder. The spotlight would soon be placed on him after he sat, then kneeled during the playing of the National Anthem that year.
He has remained unsigned since the end of the 2016 season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Richard Bevan says LMA has not had contact with EFL for three weeks</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Football is currently suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.
League Managers Association chief executive Richard Bevan claims the organisation has not spoken to the English Football League for three weeks as discussions around a return to action continue.
The age profile of many bosses, not to mention the possibility for previous health concerns, mean some of the LMA’s members are likely to be considered more vulnerable than players to coronavirus.
It is Bevan’s job to lobby in their interest and while he declares himself content with the communication involved with the Premier League – which is looking at a mid-June resumption – he noted a lack of discourse with the EFL.
“LMA are reassured by the regular dialogue with the Premier League and their public commitment on Friday to continued consultation, especially as our managers have many thousands of matches of experience and knowledge of the game,” Bevan told the Daily Telegraph.
“It’s worth noting though, that we have had no contact from the EFL for 21 days now and it seems that the Championship clubs are acting semi-autonomously anyway. Naturally, we are liaising with all EFL managers each week and debating direct with some individual EFL clubs, but there is no formal collective structure to that.
“We continue to take our responsibility to our members and the game very seriously, with our primary focus being the health and well-being of our members and everyone in the football family.
“We also need careful consideration for the moral dilemma posed by considering opening up football again at this time of national global crisis.
“The two big questions are can football restart and should football restart? Our members should have a prominent voice in answering both of those questions and we will ensure that voice is clearly heard.”
The EFL was not available for comment but it is understood that the league is content it has had sufficiently regular communication with all stakeholders.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League stars could refuse to restart season amid coronavirus pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Premier League stars could hold the key to whether the football season restarts - and they could end up vetoing the whole thing.
Clubs will talk to their players in the next 48 hours to gauge opinions about whether they are prepared to carry on under the current Project Restart proposals.
The Professional Footballers’ Association and League Managers’ Association are also to be consulted and it is the outcome of these talks which may decide whether the Premier League feel they can push on.
Mirror Sport understands player welfare was a big topic of discussion in last Friday’s Premier League meeting and there is a growing feeling that it will evolve into the biggest issue.
Players have major health concerns for themselves, the knock-on effect for their families and also there are likely to be major question marks as to whether they would even be covered by insurance should they get coronavirus.
Football clubs are unlikely to be covered and player contracts do not have any clauses for a force majeure which has left them exposed but the bigger worry is that if a family player becomes infected.
Medics are not convinced players - despite being generally positive in public - are sure about resuming games and the likes of Sergio Aguero and Glenn Murray have already spoken up.
Aguero said: “The majority of players are scared because they have family, they have children, they have babies, parents.
"It does scare me but I have just been here with my girlfriend, I haven't had contact with other people and they say that to contract the disease is very rare and difficult but they say that there are people who have it, and they don't have symptoms and they can infect you.
"That's why I've stayed at home. You can be infected and you don't know anything about it."
Players will now be consulted through captains, PFA reps and the clubs and the outcome will be fed back with the Premier League likely to meet again on Friday, 24 hours after the Government’s latest lockdown update.
That meeting is only likely to go ahead if the Government eases lockdown measures and there is a growing feeling that the whole restart may hinge on whether the players give the go-ahead as their feelings are at last likely to be heard.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Charles Barkley snubs Kobe Bryant, LeBron James in top 5 NBA players list</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Charles Barkley isn’t putting LeBron James and Kobe Bryant into the elite of the elite in NBA history.
The Hall of Famer left the two modern-era stars out of his top 5 NBA players of all-time when asked what his list would be during an appearance on Kentucky coach John Calipari’s “Coffee with Cal” show this week.
“Michael’s [Jordan] one, Oscar Robertson’s two,” Barkley said. “[Bill] Russell, Wilt [Chamberlain] and Kareem [Abdul-Jabbar], no particular order after Michael.”
While James and Bryant and their eight combined NBA championships didn’t make the first five, they did get into Barkley’s top 10.
“Kobe six, LeBron seven, then you’ve got Elgin Baylor, Jerry West,” the former 76ers, Suns and Rockets star said.
Barkley did go on to explain his decision to keep James on the outside looking in, making it a little clearer why his list was slanted more toward the old-school era players.
“You know, I love LeBron and everything about him but I still think that the way they play the game today he didn’t want any part of those bad boy Pistons,” Barkley said. “Let me tell you something, those guys were out there trying to hurt people. I used to always tell people when you were playing the Pistons you had to call home and tell your family you love them just in case you never saw them again.”
James still has time to work his way up and win a fourth championship. If the NBA season restarts after its coronavirus shutdown, James’ Los Angeles Lakers had the second-best record in the league this season behind the Milwaukee Bucks.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Charles Barkley Ranks The NBA’s 7 Greatest Players Ever</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ESPN’s docuseries The Last Dance has led many analysts to dish out their rankings of the greatest players in NBA history.
Among them is Sir Charles, who had some very interesting picks. In a recent Facebook conversation with John Calipari, Charles Barkley revealed his seven greatest NBA players ever.
Unsurprisingly, Barkley had Michael Jordan first. Given how frequently Jordan and the Bulls beat up on his 76ers and Suns, Barkley’s respect for MJ is to be expected.
But rounding out Barkley’s list are four players that may raise some eyebrows. He had Oscar Robertson second, followed in no particular order by Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
Barkley then had Kobe Bryant at sixth, then LeBron James seventh, followed by Elgin Baylor and Jerry West.
“Michael’s one, Oscar Robertson’s two,” Barkley said, per Yahoo! Sports. “Russell, Wilt and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, no particular order after Michael. Kobe six, LeBron seven, then you’ve got Elgin Baylor, Jerry West.”
Naturally, Barkley’s decision to leave LeBron outside the top five has people mad. So he preempted  the arguments against that by LeBron would not have been able to handle the Pistons that gave Michael Jordan fits for so many years.
“You know, I love LeBron and everything about him but I still think that the way they play the game today he didn’t want any part of those bad boy Pistons,” Barkley said. “Let me tell you something, those guys were out there trying to hurt people. I used to always tell people when you were playing the Pistons you had to call home and tell your family you love them just in case you never saw them again.”
Do you agree with Charles Barkley’s list of greatest NBA players? Should he have added LeBron or Kobe?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Charles Barkley Ranks Kobe As 6th Best Player of All-Time, LeBron James Is Seventh (VIDEO)</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Charles Barkley is coming through with the hottest of hot takes.
The hall of fame NBA player recently ranked his top NBA players of all-time in a recent interview with University of Kentucky men’s basketball coach John Calipari.
Barkley listed Michael Jordan as No. 1, but then listed Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in no particular order.
He then added that Kobe Bryant was No. 6 and LeBron James was No. 7.
Barkley stated that he did not think James would match up well against the “Bad Boys” Detroit Pistons teams of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
“I do think the way they play the game today, [James] didn’t want any part of those ‘Bad Boy’ Pistons,” Barkley said on Calipari’s Facebook show “Coffee with Cal.'” “Those guys were out there trying to hurt people. I used to always tell people that when you play the Pistons, you gotta call your family and tell them you love them just in case you never saw them again.”
After losing to the Pistons in three-straight playoff series, Jordan and the Bulls decided to hit the weight room, with the Great one gaining 15 pounds of muscle over the summer of 1990. It paid off and the Bulls swept the Pistons in their next playoff meeting.
“I was getting brutally beaten up,” Jordan said in episode four of the documentary series. “And I wanted to administer pain. I wanted to start fighting back.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tottenham defender Japhet Tanganga hoping to make his case for England call-up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tottenham defender Japhet Tanganga hopes his impressive rise can continue when football finally resumes and has set his sights on an England call-up.
The 21-year-old burst on to the scene in January after being surprisingly handed his Premier League debut against Liverpool and he went on to make a further nine appearances before the season was curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic.
Those sort of minutes for a young English player is usually enough to get Three Lions boss Gareth Southgate’s attention, with Chelsea’s Fikayo Tomori a good comparison having got his chance after less than half a season in Frank Lampard’s first team.
The defender, who has played all across the back four in his fleeting career, will already be known to Southgate, having represented England at every age group up to the Under-20s.
The 12-month postponement of Euro 2020 could well work out well for Tangana, who is vocal about his desire for a full cap .
“In life you have to have goals and one of my goals is to be capped at senior level for England,” he said. “For me, all I can do is what I can on the pitch and leave it with the England manager to select me.
“All I’m doing at the moment is following the guidelines and waiting for the government to decide when we can go back to football or not. Right now, that’s all I’m focusing on.
“Like I said, in life you have to have ambitions and one of my goals is to get capped at senior level for England.
“Fikayo has done that and now I’m in a similar position. I see it as an opportunity and an example to follow and hopefully one day I can get capped and achieve one of my goals.”
If he does get the call, he will owe a lot to Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho.
Mourinho, who has a reputation for ignoring young players, publicly singled Tanganga out for praise in his first training session at the club and then was brave enough to throw him in for a Premier League debut against the champions-elect.
The Portuguese was working hard with him in training as well, before they were restricted to fitness sessions via video call when the pandemic struck in March.
“He has taught me a lot,” Tanganga admitted. “In training he’s given me a lot of information, a lot of details, a lot of ways to improve.
“How to defend one v one, how to defend set-pieces or work in wide areas and at corners. He’s given me a lot of information and I feel playing right-back and left-back has added to my game and allowed me to be adaptable and defend in all areas of the pitch, not just at centre-half.
“So yeah he’s helped me a lot, given a lot of information, he’s really been very helpful.”
Tanganga has been one of the Spurs players who have stuck to government rules during the lockdown and has stayed at home with his family playing card games.
“I’m back at home with my family – my mum, dad, older brother and two younger sisters – and to be fair it’s been good,” he said.
“It’s not an ideal situation being indoors and we’ve got to follow the guidelines. But for me it’s been alright.
“It’s allowed me to spend time with my family, get close with them, play some games together, talk about things we’ve missed out on because of work or school.
“It’s allowed us to settle down, brought us closer together. We like to play Blackjack – not gambling, just trying to get rid of the deck. And Uno.
“With my friends, I play Monopoly online on PS4 – I’ve become really addicted. Also FIFA, 2K NBA, things like that. With the boys at Spurs, we play FIFA, 2K NBA – I’m a big fan of basketball so we play that a lot.”
The time away has also allowed Tanganga to reflect on his whirlwind few months, going from academy prospect to first-team regular.
“It was crazy. It just goes to show that anything can happen,” he said.
“This time last year could I see myself in this position? I don’t think so. It just goes to show how quickly things can change in football.
“Yeah, there have been moments where I wake up in the morning and remember the morning of the Liverpool game – it was disappointing to lose – but that feeling of making my debut.
“And remembering the congratulations messages from everyone. So this time has allowed me to sit back and reminisce on that breakthrough season. I just want to continue it.”

"How to defend one v one, how to defend set-pieces or work in wide areas and at corners. He's given me a lot of information and I feel playing right-back and left-back has added to my game and allowed me to be adaptable and defend in all areas of the pitch, not just at centre-half.
"So yeah he's helped me a lot, given a lot of information, he's really been very helpful."
Tanganga has been one of the Spurs players who have stuck to government rules during the lockdown and has stayed at home with his family playing card games.
"I'm back at home with my family – my mum, dad, older brother and two younger sisters – and to be fair it's been good," he said.
"It's not an ideal situation being indoors and we've got to follow the guidelines. But for me it's been alright.
"It's allowed me to spend time with my family, get close with them, play some games together, talk about things we've missed out on because of work or school.
"It's allowed us to settle down, brought us closer together. We like to play Blackjack – not gambling, just trying to get rid of the deck. And Uno.
"With my friends, I play Monopoly online on PS4 – I've become really addicted. Also FIFA, 2K NBA, things like that. With the boys at Spurs, we play FIFA, 2K NBA – I'm a big fan of basketball so we play that a lot."
The time away has also allowed Tanganga to reflect on his whirlwind few months, going from academy prospect to first-team regular.
"It was crazy. It just goes to show that anything can happen," he said.
"This time last year could I see myself in this position? I don't think so. It just goes to show how quickly things can change in football.
"Yeah, there have been moments where I wake up in the morning and remember the morning of the Liverpool game – it was disappointing to lose – but that feeling of making my debut.
"And remembering the congratulations messages from everyone. So this time has allowed me to sit back and reminisce on that breakthrough season. I just want to continue it."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tottenham defender Japhet Tanganga sets his sights on England call-up when football resumes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tottenham defender Japhet Tanganga is hoping for an England call-up when football finally resumes to achieve his "goal" of becoming a senior international.
The 21-year-old burst on to the scene in January after being surprisingly handed his Premier League debut against Liverpool and he went on to make a further nine appearances before the season was curtailed by the coronavirus pandemic.
The Englishman, who has played all across the back four in his fleeting career, will already be known to England boss Gareth Southgate, having represented England at every age group up to the U20s.
The 12-month postponement of Euro 2020 could well work out well for Tanganga, who is vocal about his desire for a full cap.
He said: "In life you have to have goals and one of my goals is to be capped at senior level for England.
"For me, all I can do is what I can on the pitch and leave it with the England manager to select me.
"All I'm doing at the moment is following the guidelines and waiting for the government to decide when we can go back to football or not. Right now, that's all I'm focusing on.
"Like I said, in life you have to have ambitions and one of my goals is to get capped at senior level for England.
"Fikayo [Tomori] has done that and now I'm in a similar position. I see it as an opportunity and an example to follow and hopefully one day I can get capped and achieve one of my goals."
If Tanganga does get the call, he will owe a lot to Tottenham boss Jose Mourinho, who was brave enough to throw him in for a Premier League debut against the league leaders.
The Portuguese was working hard with him in training as well, before they were restricted to fitness sessions via video call when the pandemic struck in March.
"He has taught me a lot," Tanganga admitted. "In training he's given me a lot of information, a lot of details, a lot of ways to improve.
"How to defend one v one, how to defend set-pieces or work in wide areas and at corners. He's given me a lot of information and I feel playing right-back and left-back has added to my game and allowed me to be adaptable and defend in all areas of the pitch, not just at centre-half.
"So yeah, he's helped me a lot, given a lot of information, he's really been very helpful."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">FC Barcelona have urged not to sell one of their stars as it could damage their chances of signing Neymar next season.

Arthur Melo has been linked with a move to Serie A Juventus in recent weeks in a move to help raise funds to sign Neymar from Paris Saint-Germain.
The Brazilian has already come out and silenced those reports while former Barcelona star Rivaldo believes it's important to keep the player, who has a good relationship with Neymar.
“There are lots of rumours about potential Barcelona transfers this summer and some press recently mentioned that Arthur could leave. I believe this is just talk and expect Arthur to stay at the club for many years," Rivaldo told Betfair.
“He hasn't completed two complete seasons there yet. He arrived as the potential successor to Xavi because of his similar style of play, so it makes no sense to sell him when he is just 23 and has his career ahead of him.
“Furthermore, Arthur has a good relationship with Neymar and selling the youngster could harm Barca's chances of bringing Neymar back.
“Of course, a potential Arthur move won't cancel a Neymar deal as he as many other friends at Barcelona. But I think it's important to keep a solid base to the squad and having Arthur could help persuade Neymar to return to the club.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Juvenuts are ready to offload Douglas Costa, Miralem Pjanic and Federico Bernardeschi in order to sign Manchester United star Paul Pogba, reports claim.
While Ole Gunnar Solskjaer wants to keep the France international at Old Trafford next season – hoping he’ll form a partnership with United new boy Bruno Fernandes – his future remains uncertain.
A host of top sides around Europe are wanting to land him, with Juventus facing competition from the likes of Serie A rivals Inter Milan, Real Madrid and Paris Saint Germain to bring him back to Turin.
Any deal is far from straightforward for the Italian champions, according to Gazzetta dello Sport.

They will need to raise funds to pull off such a high-profile transfer and are willing to sacrifice some big names from the first-team squad to lure the World Cup winner back to Juventus.
Costa, Bernadeschi and Pjanic are among the names Juve chiefs are willing to sacrifice in order to get the transfer over the line.
PSG are willing to take a similar stance, with former Manchester United man Angel Di Maria among those who could be moved on.
Pogba has endured an injury-hit season, starting just five Premier League games due to an ankle problem.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lionel Messi to part company with Barcelona after total breakdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi’s contract at the Camp Nou is due to expire next summer. The Argentina international has been at the club for practically all his life and a few years ago there seemed to be no doubt that he would stay there until the boots needed to be hung. However, things have changed drastically over the past couple of months.
Lionel Messi has taken complete advantage of Barca’s incompetent board and the fans’ love for him to a point where he is perhaps considered bigger than the club. Josep Maria Bartomeu seems have a very slouchy personality and does not seem to be the kind of a president who will confront a player’s constant demanding like Florentino Perez did to Cristiano Ronaldo.
At the Catalan club, things have gone absolutely haywire with Messi being in the thick of it more often than not since the turn of the calendar five months ago. The year didn’t start off well as Ernesto Valverde was fired from his position, but things got worse when Eric Abidal commented that the players didn’t work hard under the Basque manager. The winger was quick to take to his Instagram handle and rip into the sporting director, when internally things could’ve been solved peacefully.
Eric Abidal may not be the club’s sporting director next season and probably even the former left back is himself aware of the fact that he could be sacked from the position after a verbal duel with Messi. Having said that, the club’s captain once again took to social media to report a cut of wages owing to the coronavirus some weeks ago and reported the news even before Barca’s official website could. Such is the audacity of the little man, who is definitely taking complete leeway of being the club’s greatest and most significant personality ever.
Over the last couple of months, Messi has been endlessly pushing the board of directors to complete a much-needed revamp but it’s being said that the Argentinian is having more of a say in who must arrive and who should not as compared to Quique Setien. This has created conflicts internally with several players speaking up against his dictatorship.
Josep Maria Bartomeu has not talked to the 32-year-old in a very blunt manner amid all that’s going on, but he too would be fed up of how much interference Messi wants to have. That being said, the Blaugrana are anyway not in a situation to meet his financial demands which inflate every year or two and are willing to let go of their man amid constant quarrels, Don Balon says.
Until the next year, when Messi’s contract expires and he is possibly free to walk, Bartomeu may be the Barca president but in his final few days and it would be interesting to see how the elections pan out and whether Joan Laporta has a different lookout over the situation. Nevertheless, there would be no shortage of suitors for the all-time Barcelona top scorer.
Inter Milan reportedly will be ready to accommodate the Barca superstar on their roster should matters go their way and Newell’s Old Boys, the player’s first club will always have its doors open to the one who has become the world’s best on his second venture. The MLS continues to be an attractive destination too, but Messi has stayed coy on playing in the US.
Do you think Barca must let Lionel Messi go for free in 2021 if he is indeed the person who has been complicating things at the club?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Inter Milan emerge as front runners for Paul Pogba?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The France international's future remains the subject of much speculation, with both Juventus and Real Madrid thought to be keen to sign the 2018 World Cup winner this summer.
Paris Saint-Germain have also been credited with an interest, but according to Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter could become the front runners for the central midfielder.
The report claims that Antonio Conte's side are hoping to raise over £90m in transfer funds this summer by selling both Mauro Icardi and Ivan Perisic, while Lautaro Martinez is also being linked with a move to Barcelona.
Juve are allegedly only in a position to negotiate a swap deal for Pogba, although a recent report claimed that Madrid were lining up a £70m offer ahead of this summer's transfer window.
The 27-year-old's current deal at Old Trafford is due to expire in June 2021, although the Red Devils have the option of activating a further 12 months to protect his value.
Inter have signed both Romelu Lukaku and Ashley Young from United since last summer, while Alexis Sanchez is currently on loan at San Siro until the end of the season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marcelo Discusses Real Madrid Future & Wades in on Lionel Messi/Cristiano Ronaldo Debate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Long serving Real Madrid defender Marcelo has no plans to leave the club this summer, and has no inclination that he will be sold.
The 31-year-old has become part of the Santiago Bernabeu furniture, making over 500 appearances in all competitions after joining from Fluminense in 2007.
The Brazilian has come under pressure from summer signing Ferland Mendy for a regular first team place this season, limiting him to just 11 La Liga appearances before football was forced to take an extended break due to the coronavirus pandemic.
But Marcelo's lack of minutes hasn't called his loyalty to the club into question, though, with an Instagram Q&A with former teammate Fabio Cannavaro revealing that he has no plans to go anywhere just yet, despite past interest from Juventus.
"I don't want to leave and I don't think Real Madrid will sell me," Marcelo said, in quotes carried by Marca.
"I have done very well at Madrid since arriving. It's been a long time and it's an incredible story. I do think it's good that other teams are interested in me, but I don't know about Juventus.
"Two years ago I had already signed with them [Juventus], and had their shirt on because I couldn't live without Cristiano Ronaldo. People make up a lot of things."
Inevitably, after spending the best part of a decade playing with Ronaldo, Marcelo was also quizzed about whether the Portuguese star is better than Barcelona's Lionel Messi.
His reply was diplomatic enough, praising both for differing qualities, adding that it's impossible to say one way or the other.
"You can't say who is better," Marcelo retorted. "I played with Cristiano for 10 years, and the motivation he gives you is unique, how he raises your own game. You think Messi is under control, then out of nowhere he scores a goal."
When Marcelo eventually does leave Real Madrid, he'll depart as one of the most decorated players in the club's history. To date, he has won 21 honours - including four Champions League titles and four La Liga crowns.

    <h5 class="mb-1">"Being alongside Zlatan is a blessing"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Theo Hernández, one of AC Milan's best players this campaign, spoke about his season at Milan to 'La Gazzetta dello Sport'.
AC Milanhave not been as consistent as they would like this season, but they have been some positive signs.
One of them, the former Real Madrid player Theo Hernandez, is unanimously considered to be one of Serie A's best players this season. 
The Frenchman spoke about this term so far to 'La Gazzetta dello Sport': "It has been a very important year for me. I have adapted very quickly to a new league and the pressure of being at a big club."
Theo praised Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who said it was "a blessing" to be able to share a team with him. "Being in contact with Zlatan is a blessing, an opportunity to improve together with one of the best players in the world," he explained.
Main links
The former Real Madrid player admitted his great adaptation to the club, the city and the culture and tried to analyse his future. "I'm still very young and I have room to grow. We will see what the future brings," he said in relation to a possible change in position. That is what Gareth Bale did as he began as a full back.
The French defender denied he was a main man for AC Milan because "I still need to play lots of games to become it" and he seemed willing to fight for a place in the France national team at Euro 2021.
To conclude, he supported Pioli, his under fire coach, and admitted he was a great admirer of Paolo Maldini: "He has always been a role model for me. I'm happy he and his son Daniel have recovered."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scottish FA vice-president fears 'total disaster' of cancelling next season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scottish Football Association vice-president Mike Mulraney said on Sunday he fears the governing body might face the "total disaster" scenario of cancelling the next domestic season due to the coronavirus.
The Scottish Professional Football League has abandoned the remainder of the current Championship, League One and League Two seasons after a lengthy and controversial process.
There is no decision yet on how to finish the rest of the 2019-20 Scottish Premiership campaign, but it would be no surprise if it is called off after the French and Dutch leagues were abandoned because of the pandemic.
Now Mulraney, who is also chairman of second tier Alloa, says the SFA are planning for potential situations that include restricted fan access and a campaign behind closed doors -- if the 2020-21 season can begin at all.
And he warned it would be "foolhardy" not to face up to the possibility of Scottish clubs going out of business during the health crisis.
"We have run some pretty stark realities we think are real, meaningful and, if not probable, possible," Mulraney told BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound programme.
"We have three main visions we see we have to deal with as a club. One is a very restricted fanbase, which we think is a possibility.
"The second is how we would run a season without fans, and then it's the total disaster scenario which we have to look at as a club, which is what if we can't play football for another season?
"The last one is the one you have to look at because right now we can't play football."
On the prospect of playing without fans, Mulraney said: "It would be incredibly difficult, there's no point pretending otherwise. We have run the numbers at Alloa and think we could probably do one season with no fans.
"Football is the fans but if it requires us to do something like this to ensure we have a football product at the end of it, we have to look at how we give media partners content."
After SFA chief medical officer Dr John MacLean admitted the game was likely to remain suspended until September or October, Mulraney added: "We have to give ourselves the best chance but I would not say I expect Alloa Athletic to be playing football in August or September.
"We need to create an environment where we give answers to the public, players, fans, staff and, critically, our government, to allow them to have confidence to restart football in Scotland."

"Football is the fans but if it requires us to do something like this to ensure we have a football product at the end of it, we have to look at how we give media partners content.
"We need to look at totally new ways of how we get our game back and get our game to our fans."
After SFA chief medical officer Dr John MacLean admitted the game was likely to remain suspended until September or October, Mulraney added: "We have to give ourselves the best chance but I would not say I expect Alloa Athletic to be playing football in August or September.
"We hope we are playing but we need the whole football family to address it.
"We need to create an environment where we give answers to the public, players, fans, staff and, critically, our government, to allow them to have confidence to restart football in Scotland.
"We have to focus our mind on getting answers but these answers are going to be incredibly difficult. The environment we are dealing with is changing almost daily."
The Scottish football authorities have set up six committees to help get the game in a position that playing again might be possible, and governing bodies from a number of sports are due to hold talks with sports minister Joe Fitzpatrick on Tuesday.
Mulraney said: "What we hope is not that any large statement will come out of it and answer the problem. I think that's unrealistic.
"It's a journey that football is taking along with Government to try to get football back to be safely played again in Scotland.
"It's very welcome to get the opportunity to speak to the Government again and it's part of the process."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Football needs to come back' - Kevin Doyle believes Premier League return is needed to lift sporting spirits</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin Doyle believes footballers should be ready to return to action next month, as the former Ireland striker backed proposals for Premier League clubs to commence training again in the next few days.
After the Sunday World broke the story last weekend, revealing details of how football chiefs are hoping to get the final 92 matches of the current English season, Doyle has told us that the resumption of football is needed to lift the spirits of sports fans around the world.
While he accepts there will be some who find talk of a restart to be unpalatable – with the death toll from coronavirus edging towards a horrifying figure of 30,000 in the UK – the former Republic of Ireland striker insists hearts will be warmed if sport returns to our lives.
Doyle believes horse racing, golf and football can return in the next few weeks, as he offered up a considered assessment of why we need sport more than ever before.
"You can ask whether it is morally right for us to be thinking about trying to return to football after thousands of people have just died of this virus in England in the last few weeks," he pondered, in an exclusive interview with the Sunday World.
"That is a tough question to answer, but from a personal perspective, I think we have to try and get sport back on and if the doctors and the experts say it is okay, then we have to go with that.
"There is no chance of fans returning to stadiums for a long time, so it means we have to look at alternative plans and I can't see any harm in it being played behind closed doors," said the striker, who played for Reading, Wolves and Crystal Palace in the Premier League.
"I don't have this view because I'm worried about Liverpool winning the title or who gets relegated. The team I have followed all my life are not involved in the title race this season, so I don't care about the outcome.
"For me, football needs to come back for different reasons as millions of people in England and Ireland are eager for this to happen. I am open to all sports coming back, if we can find a way to do it safely, because people need it in their lives during these difficult times.
"People will be going back to work in the next few weeks, so I don't see why football can't make an attempt to return when some of the lockdown restrictions are relaxed and it would be good for our collective well-being to see football back on our screens.
"There will be people arguing against sport returning, but they probably don't have any interest in it. I think football, horse racing, golf... if we can do it behind closed doors, and do it as safely as possible, we have to try because fans are not coming back for a long time."
While Premier League chiefs are continuing to make plans to resume their season, the French and Dutch leagues have been cancelled in recent days and there are increasing doubts over whether the Italian league will be given the green light to resume by government officials.
There have also been reports that some Premier League players are uncomfortable with the prospect of returning to training in the current climate, yet Doyle insists they should be ready to strap on their boots and get back to work.
"If I was still playing now, I'd want to get out on the pitch as soon as possible," he continues. "Maybe my attitude would be different if I had someone in my family affected by coronavirus, but we have to look at ways to get life moving again.
"We can't go on like this. People are either going to die from the virus or we could be in a position where the whole country is depressed and goes bankrupt as we wait for a vaccine. We have to find some kind of balance in between those two scenarios.
"It will be interesting to see when the final analysis of this period in our lives pans out.
"How many people are going to die after not being able to have cancer treatments? How many will lose their lives due to depression and other issues arising from this?
"I would imagine that figure will probably be even higher than it is for people dying of the virus in Ireland, so we have to try and limit the damage as much as we can.
"Like a lot of people, I gave up watching the news a long time ago. What's the point? These 24-hour news channels have the gloom on all day and after the first two weeks, I decided there was nothing new to learn, so I have avoided them and we need some joy back in our lives."
The UK government and Premier League chiefs will face a backlash if someone playing a part in football's return is infected by Covid-19, but Doyle believes risks can be diluted with careful planning.
"If a footballer catches coronavirus, clearly people will say it was a mistake to try and get the Premier League back so soon, but that could happen when you go to the shops or go back to any kind of work," he adds.
"Are things going to be better in August or September than they are now? We just don't know. It might not get any better, so we have to see what is possible.
"If we have around 300 people working at games, which I'm told is the figure they are looking at to get the Bundesliga games back, then we have to make sure that group of people are tested regularly and they don't let the virus into that group.
"All the players will be tested regularly, they will take every precaution to try and make sure the virus is not getting into dressing rooms, so I don't see why it can't go ahead.
"We didn't know where we were going when they shut sport down a few weeks ago, but we are all used to this new reality now and we have to try and find a way to adapt to the world as it is now – and I think football can be a part of that."
With the UK government appearing to be encouraging the return of the Premier League next month, the prospect of matches returning remains a stated aim of all involved in a story that is likely to have plenty of twists and turns before games are back on our TV screens.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FA Cup final date pencilled in as governing body bids to curb £100m financial loss</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This season's FA Cup final has reportedly been pencilled in for Saturday August 8 as football chiefs continue to put the finishing touches on the Premier League's Project Restart proposal.
Top-flight bosses have held several meetings in a bid to finish the remaining matches of the 2019/20 season despite the coronavirus crisis wreaking havoc on football schedules.
And the FA are also keen for their FA Cup to conclude too and hope that the famous competition can bring the curtain down on the season.
The Daily Mail report that August 8 has been scheduled but a midweek date of August 5 is also under consideration.
The FA have previously detailed how the governing body will lose more than £100million due to the coronavirus and enforced cutbacks.
It is hoped that the Premier League will resume behind closed doors, and then the FA Cup will conclude the season at the beginning of August.
Amid the financial implications, the FA hope they will get the bulk of their money for this year's TV deals if they can finish the remaining seven fitures.
FA chief executive Mark Bullingham has already discussed the losses facing the governing body.
He said: "We have taken an immediate and significant financial impact due to the postponement of England internationals, FA Cup matches and Wembley events and there is no clear timescale on when they will return. The total financial impact is forecast to be around £100m but it could easily exceed £150m depending on the duration of the government's necessary medical measures.
"We are proposing all employees earning £50,000 or more per annum will take a temporary pay reduction of 7.5 per cent.
"In the spirit of those on higher salaries taking the greater responsibility, the senior management team have agreed to cut their pay by 15 per cent, with the highest earners in the organisation agreeing to reduce their pay by up to 30 per cent."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barcelona face paying Liverpool another €20m for Philippe Coutinho</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Barcelona face the prospect of paying Liverpool another €20m (£17.75m) for Philippe Coutinho next year if they cannot find a buyer for the Brazilian and he returns to the club.
Coutinho has been widely linked with a move away from Barcelona after an underwhelming first 18 months at the club and a disappointing loan spell at Bayern Munich this season.
The likes of Chelsea, Tottenham and Arsenal have been linked with moves to bring the 27-year-old back to the Premier League, but the coronavirus pandemic had made any deal less likely, with clubs struggling amid the economic uncertainty.
Barcelona would still want upwards of £60m for Coutinho, and after a forgettable season in the Bundesliga and his 28th birthday coming up in June, he is not necessarily an appealing prospect.
Barca are not immune to the economic uncertainty and are considering bringing Coutinho back into the fold rather than venturing into the transfer market themselves.
However, that will come at a cost in itself, as if the Brazilian makes another 24 appearances for the club, taking his total to 100, then Liverpool will be owed another £17.75m.
The Catalan side paid an initial fee of €120 for Coutinho in January 2017 and have paid a further €15m in add-ons since. However, there remains the potential for another €20m for reaching 100 appearances and an extra €5m if Barcelona were to win the Champions League.
While bringing Coutinho back to the Nou Camp may save Barcelona diving back into the transfer market, it is still likely to cost them money if he can rack up 24 appearances over a season, which seems probable.
Another possible route out of Barcelona for Coutinho could be Newcastle, a club that will have plenty of money to spend when their incoming Saudi Arabian owners have their takeover confirmed.
Rumours are flying of new managers and players, and Coutinho is on the list of targets, but is only likely to be persuaded if a high profile manager is appointed, such as key target Mauricio Pochettino.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Arsenal 'want to sell Henrikh Mkhitaryan this summer'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic, which has caused havoc across the world of sport, is expected to have a significant impact on club's spending ahead of the 2020-21 campaign.
According to The Mirror, Gunners boss Mikel Arteta is still hopeful of doing business this summer, but the club will have to raise funds via player sales.
The report claims that Mkhitaryan will be available for transfer this summer, with the Armenia international potentially on the market for as little as £10m.
The 31-year-old has spent the 2019-20 campaign on loan with Roma, scoring six times and registering four assists in 20 appearances for the Italian club in all competitions.
The Serie A side are allegedly keen on a permanent deal for Mkhitaryan but have thus far been frustrated in their attempts to agree a price with Arsenal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League side interested in £62m move for Real Madrid attacker</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to the Sun via an exclusive report from 90min, Newcastle have enquired about the availability of Real Madrid striker Luka Jovic as they eye a potential £62m deal for the Serbian star.
Jovic has failed to make an impact since joining Los Blancos last summer for an initial fee of €65m, as per the Guardian.
90min add that West Ham have also expressed an interest in the 22-year to Real Madrid.
The Hammers are keen on reuniting Sebastian Haller with the ace – the pair were a deadly duo for Eintracht Frankfurt before earning their respective big-money moves.
It’s added that Arsenal are also eyeing a move for Jovic, which isn’t surprising considering the speculation surrounding Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s future.
The Sun reiterate that Newcastle’s potential £62m move for the ace is only on the cards if their prospective takeover from owners backed by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund is completed.
90min suggest that former Newcastle forward Aleksandr Mitrovic has spoken highly of the Toon outfit to his Serbia teammate Jovic.
The Tyneside outfit may be best placed to sign Jovic, should their pending takeover go through, as 90min claim that West Ham are only eyeing a loan for the ace, the Hammers are reluctant to agree a deal that would include the option to sign Jovic permanently.
The Serbian has managed just two goals and two assists in 24 appearances across all competitions for Zinedine Zidane’s side this season, the striker has only started in 30% of these outings.
It would be Jovic’s phenomenal form in the 18/19 season that would appeal to potential suitors, the ace bagged 27 goals and seven assists for Frankfurt in the Bundesliga and Europa League which was enough to convince Madrid to part with the big bucks for his signing.
These latest reports on Jovic are perhaps a bit hard to believe, as the £62m fee that Newcastle are tipped to pay for the ace is actually around £5m more than Madrid initially paid for the star.
Do you think it’s possible that Jovic – a player who has made very little impact in his debut season for Madrid, could be sold for a profit?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Real Madrid Plotting 'Exit Operation' to Free Up Space for New Signings This Summer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Real Madrid could look to offload as many as seven first-team players before making any new signings this summer, with the club looking to shave €80m off their wage bill.
Like many teams across Europe, Real Madrid are struggling with their finances as a result of the coronavirus crisis. Los Blancos have to match their €741m expenses for the season, but it's already expected they'll lose 20 per cent of their projected income at best, meaning they would only bring in €657m.
One of the most draining parts of the club is their wage bill, which currently stands at €283m, but AS reports Real Madrid will look to reduce that by at least €80m ahead of the 2020/21 La Liga season.
The Spanish media outlet names seven players who could be moved on once the transfer window opens, with Gareth Bale and James Rodríguez, who have a combined salary of €48m, unsurprisingly being placed on Real Madrid's transfer list.
Mariano Díaz and Jesús Vallejo are surplus to requirements, while Dani Ceballos and Álvaro Odriozola - who are on loan at Arsenal and Bayern Munich respectively - also don't appear to be part of Real Madrid's long-term plans.
Surprisingly, Real Madrid are also considering the future for ex-Manchester City winger Brahim Díaz. The 20-year-old hasn't been able to make an impact since moving to the Santiago Bernabéu in January 2019, now sitting firmly behind Vinícius Júnior and Rodrygo in the club's pecking order.
90min have also learned Arsenal, Newcastle United and West Ham are interested in taking Luka Jović off Real Madrid's hands before the start of next season.
The Serbia international has struggled in his first season with the club, scoring just two goals since a £54m move from Bundesliga side Eintracht Frankfurt.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Called social media sensations for trials to appear hands-on: Rijiju</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said that calling for urgent trials for social media sprint sensations, seen running with buffaloes, were decisions taken under pressure to appear hands-on in his job.
Kambala jockey Srinivas Gowda of Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh’s Rameshwar Gurjar had hit national headlines last year for running in slushy and dusty fields respectively.
They were believed to have completed 100m sprints in 11 seconds, creating a flutter on social media platforms, where some dubbed them, one after another, the next Usain Bolt.
“In Madhya Pradesh, somebody had a video of a village boy’s running and posted it on social media, commented that he runs faster than Usain Bolt. When it became viral, I could have ignored it but suppose I don’t react on that time, people will say the sports minister is silent, is not taking cognizance,” he said.
In the trial though, Mr. Gurjar could not live up to the expectations and could barely complete the 100m distance in 12.9 seconds.
Mr. Rijiju added, “Shivraj Singh Chouhan also asked me to look into the matter. So I sent my SAI team to test the guy in Bhopal. I knew his capability but the country doesn’t know what is the nature of sports. People just started saying he runs faster than Bolt and that is because of lack of awareness.”
“During the test he wouldn’t even compete with the junior guys forget the seniors, he can’t run even 13 seconds flat in 100m. He never trained. He was 25-26, so age was also not on his side; he didn’t know how to wear spikes.”
Mr. Rijiju also spoke about the story around Mr. Gowda, whose exploits during a traditional buffalo race in Karnataka created a buzz on social media, forcing the Minister to call the 28-year-old for a trail at the SAI, Bengaluru centre.
This was after after video clips of him running a distance of 100 metres in just 9.55 seconds surfaced.
“Then 4-5 months back a news broke out that somebody broke Usain Bolt’s record in a bull race in Karnataka. Even some of the professional people, some of the businessmen, some of the renowned people of India stated that now this guy will bring Olympic gold in 100m,” Mr. Rijiju said.
“People must be thinking that what is the sports minister doing, he is responding to such kinds of amateur talks but I had to show sections who don’t know sports that I am hands on with Indian sports and I am there for the athletes. I will give all the opportunities to all potentials, so I had to show that,” he said.
The Minister said it’s high time people broaden their knowledge about sports other than cricket to enable India become a sporting powerhouse.
“Many people complained to me that government does not contribute enough for the development of sports in India. Let me make it very clear — knowledge about sports in India is very, very low. People know only about cricket, people don’t know about other sports,” Mr. Rijiju said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sweat and saliva aren't big requirements in white-ball cricket, feels Jaydev Unadkat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: There is a raging debate on whether the use of sweat and saliva should be banned once cricket resumes after the COVID-19 pandemic but seamer Jaydev Unadkat feels that these components won't make much of a difference with white ball.
Unadkat, who has played 7 ODIs and 10 T20 Internationals for India, is a sought-after name in the IPL and plies his trade for Rajasthan Royals.
"I think white ball won't be a problem as a whole. Even in ODIs, you will be using two new balls 25 overs each. Reverse swing has never been a big factor in white-ball cricket. Even the new ball doesn't require any sweat or saliva as far as white ball is concerned," Unadkat said during an interaction.
The Ranji Trophy-winning Saurashtra captain said the reason behind that is that the quote of white lacquer requires little or no sweat or saliva for swing.

"White lacquer remains shiny even if you just rub it on your trousers while for red ball, the red lacquer and the red leather demands that we shine it more with saliva and sweat," the left-arm seamer said.
That's the reason, he feels, that in limited over contests, it will be a lesser risk for bowlers and can be started before one gets to the Test and first-class games.
"If we are starting with white-ball contests, we will surely have an advantage as saliva and sweat are as big a factor as it could be in red-ball cricket."
Even for red-ball cricket, Unadkat feels that precautions will be necessary only if cricket starts before the pandemic has subsided completely.
"If we start closed doors, then probably certain precautions will be mandatory."
Unadkat says that a prolonged break also means that he will be on even keel with some of the other bowlers who would be vying for their places in the Indian team for the World T20.
In fact, had the IPL started on March 29, Unadkat would have barely got three weeks rest after a gruelling domestic season where he carried the burden of Saurashtra bowling.
"To be honest, the big break evens out a lot of things as far as team selection is concerned. A lot will depend on who can carry the form through the break and who can come out sooner.
"You can't really judge now as you don't know how big the break will be. Even if I don't get match time sooner, if we get practice time sooner, it won't take much time to get back the rhythm."
While remaining fit has been a requirement, Unadkat has taken time out to pursue another vocation, which is learning guitar.
It was his fiancee Rinny who encouraged him to take up online guitar classes along with her.
"I had done a few classes in the past but then lost touch a couple of years back. Luckily my fiancee is also a guitar fan and has taken lessons in the past and both of us decided to enroll for online classes.
"Two notations that I am currently trying to pick up are Ben King's Stand By Me and John Legend's All of Me are some tunes that I am picking up. Still a little difficult," Unadkat said.
While the fingers strum the strings of the guitar, they also want to feel the seam of five and a half ounce of hard cherry.
"Now, after more than one month, I am missing being out there on the field and at the same time I know that we have not experienced anything like this before. I think we have to support each other as we go through this."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Stopping use of sweat, saliva for shining balls won’t affect white-ball cricket: Jaydev Unadkat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Weighing in on the debate on whether the use of sweat and saliva should be banned once cricket resumes after the Covid-19 pandemic, Indian seamer Jaydev Unadkat said that these aspects won’t make much of a difference with white ball.
Unadkat, who has played seven ODIs and 10 T20 Internationals for India, is a sought-after name in the IPL and has been a part of the Rajasthan Royals franchise over the last few years.
“I think white ball won’t be a problem as a whole. Even in ODIs, you will be using two new balls 25 overs each. Reverse swing has never been a big factor in white-ball cricket. Even the new ball doesn’t require any sweat or saliva as far as white ball is concerned,” Unadkat told PTI.
The Ranji Trophy-winning Saurashtra captain said the reason behind that is that the coat of white lacquer requires little or no sweat or saliva for swing.
“White lacquer remains shiny even if you just rub it on your trousers while for red ball, the red lacquer and the red leather demands that we shine it more with saliva and sweat,” the left-arm seamer said.
That’s the reason, he feels, that in limited-overs formats, it will be a lesser risk for bowlers and can be started before one gets to the Test and first-class games.
“If we are starting with white-ball contests, we will surely have an advantage as saliva and sweat are not as big a factor as it could be in red-ball cricket.”

“To be honest, the big break evens out a lot of things as far as team selection is concerned. A lot will depend on [whether one] can carry the form through the break and who can can come out sooner.

“I had done a a few classes in the past but then lost touch a couple of years back. Luckily my fiancee is also a guitar fan and has taken lessons in the past and both of of us decided to enrol for online classes,” he said.
Ultimately, he wanted to get back on the field soon.
“Now, after more than one month, I am missing being out there on the field and at the same time I know that we have not experienced anything like this before. I think we have to support each other as we go through this,” the pacer added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The thought of facing Lee took my sleep away, don't want to face Hazlewood now: Rohit Sharma</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The thought of standing up to Brett Lee's thunderbolts had taken Rohit Sharma's "sleep away" when he first started out but among the current lot, Josh Hazlewood is one speedster the India swashbuckler "doesn't want to face" in Tests.
Rohit said he will have to be mentally prepared to face Hazlewood when India tour Australia for a Test series later this year, provided the COVID-19 pandemic subsides.
Asked to name the toughest pacers he has faced so far, Rohit said, "One bowler is Brett Lee because he didn't let me sleep the previous night on my first tour to Australia in 2007, as I was thinking how to play this bowler who bowls in excess of 150 kmph."
"In 2007, Brett Lee was at his peak. I used to watch him closely and noticed that he was consistently bowling at the speed of around 150-155 kmph. The thought of a youngster like me facing that kind of speed took away my sleep," Rohit said of the former Australian speed merchant on Star Sports' 'Cricket Connected'.
Since making his debut in 2007 as a precocious talent, Rohit has gone on to become one of the world's most prolific batsmen, and his exploits in limited overs cricket are second to none.
Rohit has racked up 29 ODI hundreds and six centuries in Test cricket, besides four three-figure mark in the T20 Internationals.
"Currently, someone whom I don't want to face in Test cricket would be Josh Hazlewood because he's disciplined and does not move away from that length. He does not give you loose balls," he said.
Among the retired lot, Rohit said South African pace great Dale Steyn has also given him nightmares because of his ability to swing the ball at great speed.
"I have two retired favourite bowlers who I never wanted to face, one was Brett Lee and the other was Dale Steyn. I never wanted to face Steyn because playing pace and swing at the same time was a nightmare, it was just unreal."
Rohit said he continues to face quality bowlers in the present day with Hazlewood being among the best .
"I have watched him enough to understand that. I know for a fact that if I have to go to Australia to play a Test, then I have to be mentally prepared to be disciplined while facing Josh," said the scorer of three double hundreds in ODIs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The thought of facing Lee took my sleep away, don’t want to face Hazlewood now: Rohit Sharma</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The thought of standing up to Brett Lee’s thunderbolts had taken Rohit Sharma’s “sleep away” when he first started out but among the current lot, Josh Hazlewood is one speedster the India swashbuckler “doesn’t want to face” in Tests.
Rohit said he will have to be mentally prepared to face Hazlewood when India tour Australia for a Test series later this year, provided the Covid-19pandemic subsides.
Asked to name the toughest pacers he has faced so far, Rohit said, “One bowler is Brett Lee because he didn’t let me sleep the previous night on my first tour to Australia in 2007, as I was thinking how to play this bowler who bowls in excess of 150 kmph.”
“In 2007, Brett Lee was at his peak. I used to watch him closely and noticed that he was consistently bowling at the speed of around 150-155 kmph. The thought of a youngster like me facing that kind of speed took away my sleep,” Rohit said of the former Australian speed merchant on Star Sports’ ‘Cricket Connected’.
Since making his debut in 2007 as a precocious talent, Rohit has gone on to become one of the world’s most prolific batsmen, and his exploits in limited overs cricket are second to none.
Rohit has racked up 29 ODI hundreds and six centuries in Test cricket, besides four three-figure mark in the T20 Internationals.
“Currently, someone whom I don’t want to face in Test cricket would be Josh Hazlewood because he’s disciplined and does not move away from that length. He does not give you loose balls,” he said.
Among the retired lot, Rohit said South African pace great Dale Steyn has also given him nightmares because of his ability to swing the ball at great speed.
“I have two retired favourite bowlers who I never wanted to face, one was Brett Lee and the other was Dale Steyn. I never wanted to face Steyn because playing pace and swing at the same time was a nightmare, it was just unreal.”
Rohit said he continues to face quality bowlers in the present day with Hazlewood being among the best .
“I have watched him enough to understand that. I know for a fact that if I have to go to Australia to play a Test, then I have to be mentally prepared to be disciplined while facing Josh,” said the scorer of three double hundreds in ODIs.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Juventus chief warns Paul Pogba over Man Utd exit and makes Ronaldo comparison</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Juventus Chief Football Officer Fabio Paratici has discussed the Italian champions’ interest in Manchester United star Paul Pogba but admits the club will not be able to spend big this summer and has warned him not to expect a massive pay day.
The French midfielder is out of contract in the summer of 2021 – though United have the option to trigger a one-year extension – and has been stalling over renewal talks, with his agent, Mino Raiola, clashing with the club’s hierarchy and manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
Fearful of losing Pogba on the cheap and wary of their increasingly strained relationship, United are believed to be open to selling the World Cup winner if they receive a sum close to the £89m they paid four years ago.
Both Real Madrid and old club Juve have been heavily linked with Pogba, though the changing financial landscape due to the coronavirus crisis has considerably altered the European giants’ spending power.
It has instead been suggested that Juve will look to trade players this summer – with Miralem Pjanic and Douglas Costa among the first-team stars who could be swapped – and Paratici confirmed that approach on Sunday, while he also warned Pogba to forget about earning an astronomical salary.
Speaking to Sky Sport Italia, he said: ‘Paul Pogba is a fantastic player, we know him as a champion.
‘But something will change after the coronavirus crisis, because logically the salary demands someone at his level would have had before is now more difficult to get hold of. Or, at least, he’ll have fewer clubs prepared to pay that money.’
On why Pogba cannot hope to be handed a similar salary to Cristiano Ronaldo, he added: ‘Cristiano is a different player to all the others. He brings incredible and exponential growth in revenue, representing a brand that is almost as big as a club.’
Speaking about how clubs’ transfer strategies will need to change, he continued: ‘Clubs will certainly have some more difficulties to deal with, so with less income, we’ll need to be more creative and elastic, finding a different formula for transfer deals. I expect many exchanges of players, although obviously we can’t use the NBA draft because that is a closed system.
‘We should take more from the NBA and American sports in general. After all, the Premier League has this big advantage over the other leagues because they control the brand and represent the whole league rather than individual clubs.
‘What we will see is more extended loans, so a two-year loan, even three. Some say we could start the 2020-21 season with the same players as 2019-20, which is also a possibility.
‘There will certainly be less cash circulating and that’s obvious to everyone. We are going through a difficult moment globally, not just in football, and the consequences will be felt everywhere. Therefore, I think we’ll see longer loans because rather than purchase homes, people are more likely in a time of uncertainty to rent.
‘I believe that if we exchange players between the top 12-15 clubs in the world, the value of the transfers won’t drop. When purchasing a new player, that’s a different matter and we can see a fall in the fees.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Liverpool linked with move for Napoli star Kalidou Koulibaly; tipped to beat Manchester United</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Liverpool have strangely been linked with a move for Napoli superstar defender Kalidou Koulibaly, even though uncertainty surrounds the financial positions of football clubs because of the ongoing pandemic.
Manchester United are said to be interested in the Senegalese stalwart, but the Reds have reportedly moved ahead of the Red Devils in the queue for the centre-half.
That’s according to Tuttomercatoweb, who – without any legitimate basis – say Jurgen Klopp could look to offload Joel Matip and replace him with Koulibaly.
While this deal would make sense on Football Manager, it’s not realistic. The coronavirus pandemic has thrown question marks over the financial positions of every football club in the world.

Koulibaly would cost potential suitors around £60million, and there is very little chance anyone would be willing to sanction that fee in the current climate.
Whether the Reds are interested in the centre-back is another thing, but we’d urge supporters to be extra cautious of rumours – at least until the financial impact of COVID-19 is realised.
Besides, Joe Gomez and Joel Matip are more than good enough to start alongside Virgil van Dijk!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Contact made: Tottenham in talks with Serie A side over €30m defensive talent</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With reports suggesting that Jan Vertonghen will be allowed to leave Tottenham on a free transfer in the summer, Jose Mourinho has already set about finding his replacement.
The Belgian has been a fine servant for the north London club, but according to Gazzetta Dello Sport and cited by the Daily Star, contact has been made with Hellas Verona over the €30m transfer of their highly-rated 20-year-old, Marash Kumballa.
Already with one senior cap for the Albanian national side, the youngster is continuing to make waves, and a move to England may well appeal if he wants to test himself against some of the best strikers on the continent.
The potential sale price, which equates to £26.6m, should be well within budget and that’s likely to satisfy the money men at the club including chairman, Daniel Levy.
However, Spurs face competition from both Everton and Inter Milan to secure his services according to Gazzetta Dello Sport and cited by the Daily Star, so it remains to be seen if the pulling power of the Special One still has the desired effect.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this week, it was suggested that the Catalan giants were prepared to make a bid for the Frenchman, who has struggled during his first campaign in the Premier League.
While Ndombele has made 27 appearances in all competitions, just 12 starts have been made in England's top flight.
Should they give the green light to a sale, Spurs allegedly want to receive a fee close to the £65m which they paid last summer.
However, Sport claims that Barcelona will only firm up their initial interest if they can offload either Nelson Semedo or Samuel Umtiti as part of the deal.
Spurs are in the market for a new right-back and centre-back as they look to find long-term replacements for Kieran Trippier and Jan Vertonghen respectively.

    <h5 class="mb-1">From France: Suggestion Chelsea behind €85m offer – Transfer games have started</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Stop me if you think you’ve heard this one before. An unnamed club has made a mega offer for a player that several Premier League clubs have been linked to.
That was the report coming out of France today, with Telefoot reporting that Lille have received an €85m offer for Victor Osimhen, bonuses included, from an unnamed club.
That, of course, has caused something of a stir, mainly because such a sum is unthinkable in the current Coronavirus ravaged football landscape but also because he’s been regularly linked with a move to the Premier League, namely to either Chelsea or Manchester United.
Well, Foot Mercato have covered that breaking news story themselves and say that such a sum would ‘probably’ have come from a Premier League club.
They add that the striker, who has 18 goals in 38 games this season, ‘is courted by Chelsea in particular’ suggesting that they believe this mega offer has come from Stamford Bridge.
However, this is something we’ve seen before, particularly when it comes to Lille.
Last summer, they were selling Nicolas Pépé, and there were numerous rumours about significant bids and constant hype around him.
That caused his value to steadily rise before he eventually ended up joining Arsenal in a £72m deal.
Throughout that saga, there were regular updates and bids from unnamed clubs, and this feels the same.
It’s more than likely that Osimhen’s agent, and Lille, are ramping up interest ahead of the summer so that the likes of Chelsea are forced to pay a massive premium in a challenging market.

Origi established himself as an Anfield cult hero last season with a series of crucial goals, including a clinching strike in the Champions League final win over Tottenham.
The Belgium international has netted a further five times in all competitions this season, but he is firmly behind star trio Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane in the pecking order.
Origi signed an improved "long-term" contract on Merseyside in July 2019, and he has no intention of moving on.
"I am a better player than last year," the 25-year-old forward told Het Laatste Nieuws. "Klopp has given me the space to develop myself.
"I always listen to my instinct and continue to work. We have spoken with Liverpool and we have a nice course ahead of us. I just want to get better here.
"It is a project for me and I want to follow it. I don't know how long I will do that. I feel that I am making progress, so it was a pity that the season stopped [due to coronavirus]."
Origi continues to revel in his goal against Spurs, adding: "I took a lot of pleasure from that moment. It was a very calm moment.
"I was able to connect with the supporters. I saw their facial expressions. It is a feeling that is very difficult to explain.
"[Andy] Robertson jumped on my back, Fabinho joined and Virgil [Van Dijk]. Unbelievable.
"The more days pass, the more I can enjoy it. It's like wine, it matures with time."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Erling Haaland makes transfer prediction as he puts Liverpool on alert with Virgil van Dijk review</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Erling Haaland has lavished praise upon Virgil van Dijk as he named the Liverpool standout the best player he has ever faced.
The 19-year-old striker is the biggest rising star in European football after netting 12 goals in 11 games for Borussia Dortmund after his January move from Salzburg.
It comes after the Leeds-born Norway international was strongly linked with a move to Manchester United before he decided to continue his development in Germany.
And Haaland admits the Liverpool star - who he faced in the Champions League while at Salzburg - is the cream of the crop defensively.
He said: "He is so good. He is powerful, quick, he possesses all the qualities. He is an incredible player."
And the strike sensation broached his own future as addressed what his plan is for the rest of his career.
He added: "I have just arrived. I am very happy here. I want to achieve many things.
"I am only concentrating on that. The stadium here gives me goose bumps, and I feel well here."
But Jessie Marsch. his former boss at Salzburg, believes Haaland's iron-clad mental make-up is what separates him from other rising stars around the world.
He said: "What makes Erling so special is his mentality.
"To start with, he was in the youth World Cup, he scored 9 goals in one game. We gave every one of our players who had international obligations three weeks off before they were supposed to come with us. Erling had six days off and then said 'no, I want to come to camp'.
"Erling came to Salzburg last winter, he played one game in spring, so he had a lot of sitting on the bench. He was so keen to start proving himself, right away I knew this kid had ambition and grind.
"He's fearless, he's competitive, he's got a drive to get better, he's equiped with so many qualities that make him very different and special, along with the ability and pure talent, he'll be fun to watch in the coming years, that's for sure."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ex-Man United ace thinks Rashford can win Ballon d’Or and ‘reach’ Mbappe’s level</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Manchester United defender Matteo Darmian has told the Guardian in an interview that Marcus Rashford is capable of being a ‘Ballon d’Or winner’ and that he can ‘reach’ Kylian Mbappe’s level.
Darmian told the Guardian that he ‘immediately thought’ that Rashford was an ‘incredible player’ after seeing the forward’s first training session with the first-team a few years ago.
The full-back, who left the Red Devils last summer, added that he’s ‘convinced’ that Rashford can win the Ballon d’Or in his career and added that the lightning-fast star ‘impressed him the most’ during his time at Old Trafford.
Rashford has been sensational for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side this season, the ace has flourished in a centre-forward role after a fairly difficult start to the season.

Here’s what Darmian had to say on the England international:
“I still remember Marcus Rashford’s first session with the senior squad like it was yesterday. I immediately thought: ‘wow, this is an incredible player’.”
“He did so many impressive things for a player of his age and the way he improved in every detail really impressed me.”
“If he continues to work the way he has done so far he can be a Ballon d’Or winner. I’m convinced of this.”
“He impressed me the most of all the players at United and he’s very young and can still improve. For me he can reach the level of Kylian Mbappe and compete for the Ballon d’Or for years to come.”
Unfortunately, Rashford’s best season to date was hindered after he suffered a long-term injury in a FA Cup clash against Wolves in January.
The Sun now report that the 22-year-old is nearing a return to full fitness, with it being claimed that the star will be ready once the Premier League returns after the UK hopefully make some progress in dealing with the Coronavirus pandemic.
Rashford has bagged 19 goals and five assists in 31 appearances across all competitions this season.
United perhaps would’ve been heavily hit by Rashford’s absence if it wasn’t for January signing Bruno Fernandes hitting the ground running and Anthony Martial’s uplift in form.
Loanee Odion Ighalo has also turned in some fine performances for the boyhood club, all in all, once Rashford returns, the Red Devils should have the in-form attack needed to secure Champions League qualification – should the Premier League season resume.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A 'Bool carnival like no other - but all the stars will be there</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">So riotous is the the party atmosphere when the races are on that the Warrnambool May carnival is regularly referred to as Schoolies Week for the over-40s.
But this week the seaside track and the bars, pubs and restaurants around Warrnambool's centre will be shuttered and the atmosphere around the town quieter than it's ever been when the festival is staged.
The 'Bool will, however, set a record of its own on Tuesday when it stages an entire day of just jumps racing.
Five hurdle races and three steeplechases will be staged, with the Brierley Steeple, the Grand Annual and the Galleywood Hurdle the headline attractions.
On the Wednesday of a truncated two-day carnival the flat racers will hog the headlines, with the Wangoom Handicap - often referred to as the Newmarket of the bush - and the Warrnambool Cup the main features.
All the top jumps riders - men like Steven Pateman, Shane Jackson and Tom Ryan - will be in action on Tuesday, while top jumps trainers such as Ciaron Maher and David Eustace, Eric Musgrove and Patrick Payne will saddle up leading contenders.
The economic impact of the ban on spectators will hit both the town and the track hard, but Tom O'Connor, the CEO of the Warrnambool Turf Club, is grateful that the meeting can go ahead at all.
There were complaints from the local council that staging the festival might present a health risk for the town, but O'Connor says strict observation of the coronavirus protocols under which racing has managed to keep going for the past six weeks should ensure risk is minimised.
''The key point was communicating broadly the strict protocols that we are adhering to on Tuesday and Wednesday. They have been put out there to the public and also through to council.
''We are very confident based on the measures that the industry has put in place that it will be a safe secure venue for the participants on both days.''
O'Connor says that despite the lockdown and lack of fans sponsors and patrons have remained loyal.
''Those who have bought hospitality packages and tickets all been offered entry next year. We have worked on a 'commit to the 'Bool in '21 strategy', so a lot of the efforts have gone into transferring clients' business from 2020 to 2021.
''We have offered refunds where people have preferred that option but we have had some amazing support from people that come to the Bool on a regular basis. They are committing to next year and are getting behind us.
''Its been similar with our business partners being able to continue to race on the two days. We have also received some fantastic support from our sponsors who have stuck with us even though times are tough for them too.''
There are eight runners or more in seven of the eight runners, allowing each way betting on the first three to finish in each race, and O'Connor is delighted with the field sizes.
''This is a first for the club having a full day of jumps, so it was always a bit of an unknown as to the support that would be out there.
''There's also been a revised jumps programme through April with Oakbank not going ahead, so there's a flow on effect there.
''But I think to have the fields we have got is great, and particularly the quality is a highlight, especially in a couple of the features. It should be a great spectacle.''

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Alex Albon claimed his first Formula One Esports Virtual Grand Prix win, denying Charles Leclerc a third straight success.
Red Bull driver Albon took the lead on the first turn after a faltering start from pole-sitter Stoffel Vandoorne and exchanged it with Ferrari rival Leclerc on countless occasions throughout the race.
The pair overtook at every opportunity on the simulated Interlagos track – chosen as a stand-in for Zandvoort, which was not available on the game – but a three-second time penalty effectively scuppered Leclerc’s hopes.
He continued pushing Albon to the line but the Londoner held on and Leclerc’s penalty, once applied, saw him slip to third behind George Russell.
Albon told Sky Sports F1 that a surprising pit-stop choice from Leclerc had given him the advantage.
“I definitely had the better strategy,” he said.
“Charles was very quick on pace, I was quite surprised because I thought he was going to go soft-medium and he decided to pit earlier. He kept overtaking me and I was getting nervous…it was all going on.”
Asked to estimate the number of times the pair had swapped the lead, he added: “In 36 laps…I would say 20 overtakes, maybe 25. It was proper fun.”
In the battle of the England cricket stars, Ben Stokes – on his second outing – was too quick for fellow guest driver Stuart Broad.
“I took part in Australia, which went horrendously, but today was good because I had a bit on it with my mate,” he said.
“Me and Stuart have been training together but as soon as we knew we were going to do the proper race it threw all that out of the window.”
Asked if he would be back in two weeks for a virtual Spanish Grand Prix, he responded: “I’ll have to look at the track.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Albon ends Leclerc streak as Stokes laps up bragging rights over Broad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Alex Albon came out on top in a titanic tussle with Charles Leclerc to win the virtual Dutch Grand Prix, while England cricketer Ben Stokes was able to celebrate despite finishing 13th.
Leclerc had won the previous two races but saw his streak come to an end in the latest round of Formula One's Esports series on Sunday.
The Ferrari driver was involved in a see-saw battle around the famous Interlagos circuit in Brazil, a switch of venue required with the Zandvoort track in the Netherlands not available.
Eventually Albon sealed glory for Red Bull, while Leclerc suffered further disappointment when a three-second penalty relegated him down to third place, meaning a promotion for George Russell.
"I was shaking afterwards. I had so much adrenaline going through my body," Albon told Sky Sports F1. "I feel more scared driving a simulator than the real thing - the pressure was unbelievable."
Leclerc was not too disappointed to have missed out on a hat-trick, saying: "I knew I had the penalty, but after that it was about having fun. I really enjoyed this race."
The other battle of interest in the field turned out to be less eventful, however.
Stokes - who had previously competed in the Australian GP - comfortably finished ahead of his international team-mate Stuart Broad, the latter coming home in 17th at the end of his virtual race debut.
As for the real Formula One season, the coronavirus-hit campaign is hoping to finally begin in Austria in early July.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Olympians look to help young athletes during shutdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CHICAGO — When Jesse Smith looks out at his Zoom audience, he knows exactly what the crowd is going through.
The captain of the U.S. men’s water polo team is adjusting his training, too. He also misses playing alongside his friends.
One way Smith is dealing with the coronavirus pandemic is through virtual speaking engagements with water polo clubs and teams all over the country, passing along what he has learned during a couple decades in the water.
The 37-year-old Smith is one of several Olympic athletes who have been using digital avenues to help their sport during the shutdown. While Zoom sessions are a frequent choice, some athletes are offering training tips on Instagram and Olympic federations are pitching in with newsletters and other web-based help.
“We're all as athletes affected the same way,” Smith said. “Even though I'm a four-time Olympian, a silver medal (winner), training for my fifth Olympics, the captain of my team, the same thing is going on in my head as a 16-year-old that got their (season) canceled, and I think that I have more tools available, so I'm trying to share that."
Beach volleyball star Kerri Walsh Jennings has been doing online talks with young volleyball players, including one with the team at her alma mater of Archbishop Mitty High School in California. U.S. wrestlers Mallory Velte, Pat Smith and Yianni Diakomihalis detailed their at-home workouts in a post on the federation website. Casey Patterson and April Ross were among a group of beach volleyball players who shared workout tips during Facebook live sessions on the AVP page.
The federations also are reaching out. USA Water Polo has been sending out a weekly newsletter called “At Home with USA Water Polo” featuring interviews with coaches and athletes. U.S. Rowing has been holding webinars for its members. USA Volleyball has a page on its website with COVID-19-related resources.
“A lot of people look to (us) in the athlete world, in our communities, for us to kind of be a voice. Like, how are we going to respond? What actions are we taking?” said U.S. softball pitcher Monica Abbott, who has been doing speaking engagements with young softball players and holding pitching-inspired workout sessions.
The effort by Olympic athletes and federations comes amid concern about the future of college sports. Some Olympic sports could be on the chopping block for athletic departments looking to save money after losing revenue due to the COVID-19 shutdown.
“I wouldn't say that that's something I'm focusing on, but it's definitely something that's in my mind and helps me plan for these,” U.S. water polo center Matt Farmer said, “because I'm taking an optimistic view of what's going to happen in college water polo, because it means so much to so many people.”
Farmer, a 24-year-old Chicago native who played on three NCAA championship teams at UCLA, is focusing his outreach efforts on the Midwest. California is the home of American water polo, but Farmer is hoping he can help some young players follow in his footsteps.
“I kind of blazed a trail from Chicago to international water polo,” Farmer said, “and I want to share my experiences with people and maybe give advice to people who are thinking about playing in college or continuing the sport and just want to grow as players and as people.”
The online conversations usually touch on a variety of topics. There are the usual practical tips for playing the sport at a high level, but there also are elements of sports psychology — especially with young players away from their teams and searching for motivation.
Walsh Jennings, a three-time Gold medalist, said the calls have become a highlight of her day.
“We're all feeling the same frustrations and longings,” she said. “It's pretty special to be able to speak to the fact that we're not alone in this and that it is up to each of us to make the best of what we have to work with — to focus on that which we can control.”

U.S. wrestlers Mallory Velte, Pat Smith and Yianni Diakomihalis detailed their at-home workouts in a post on the federation website. Casey Patterson and April Ross were among a group of beach volleyball players who shared workout tips during Facebook live sessions on the AVP page.
The federations also are reaching out. USA Water Polo has been sending out a weekly newsletter called “At Home with USA Water Polo” featuring interviews with coaches and athletes. U.S. Rowing has been holding webinars for its members. USA Volleyball has a page on its website with COVID-19-related resources.
“A lot of people look to (us) in the athlete world, in our communities, for us to kind of be a voice. Like, how are we going to respond? What actions are we taking?” said U.S. softball pitcher Monica Abbott, who has been doing speaking engagements with young softball players and holding pitching-inspired workout sessions.
The effort by Olympic athletes and federations comes amid concern about the future of college sports. Some Olympic sports could be on the chopping block for athletic departments looking to save money after losing revenue due to the COVID-19 shutdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Five Forwards Linked With Barca</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With FC Barcelona reportedly looking to bolster their attack, here are five forwards linked with a move to the Camp Nou next season.
Click through the gallery to see five attackers linked with FC Barcelona. 
With Luis Suarez getting older and Ousmane Dembele struggling with injuries, the LaLiga champions could look to the transfer marker to help Lionel Messi in attack.
Neymar continues to hog the headlines about a possible return to the Camp Nou after leaving for Paris Saint-Germain, with reports in claiming Blaugrana have re-visited their interest in the player.
Inter Milan striker Lautaro Martinez is another name heavily linked with Blaugrana, especially due to his partnership with Messi for the Argentina national side.
“He’s [Martinez] an important player, a great player, and Barcelona are always interested in great players, of course,” Quique Setien told Gazzetta dello Sport.
“But in these times without football, a different name comes out every day. There’s also been talk of Neymar. And I’m sure you’ll ask me about Fabian Ruiz.”
While those are the two biggest names on the list, RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner could be a target for the Catalan giants after admitting he would only move abroad if he changed clubs.
"Bayern are a great club, we don't need to talk about it, and Hansi Flick has proven this season he is a really good head coach," Werner told Bild.
"But if a move were to become an issue at some point, I would be more tempted by a move abroad than a move to Bayern.
The other two strikers linked with Barcelona include the highly-rated Borussia Dortmund forward Jadon Sancho and Argentina international Adolfo Gaich.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 23-year-old became Tottenham's club-record signing last summer when he arrived from Lyon.
The midfielder has found it difficult to make his mark in the English capital, though, contributing just two goals and two assists in 19 Premier League appearances.
Barca have been strongly linked with Ndombele over the last couple of weeks, but according to The Telegraph, the France international is not interested in a summer move.
The report claims that he is determined to 'prove himself' with Jose Mourinho's side and does not want to 'leave the club as a flop'.
Ndombele's contract at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium still has more than five years left to run.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Apparent Everton transfer target Yeferson Soteldo has confirmed his desire to play in Europe once he has finished out his goals with Santos. 
The Venezuelan forward was in fine form for the Brazilian side last season, scoring 10 goals and assisting six in 34 appearances and is now hopeful of leading the club to Copa Libertadores success before heading to European shores. He confirmed this status in conversation with The Original Drink Team. 
Everton are seemingly tracking the player. At least, that is according to the Brazilian side’s president. Jose Carlos Perez told Calciomercato that Everton had been in touch regarding the player and that he was currently valued at £32 million.
Everton’s interest would make sense. Director of football Marcel Brands is known for picking up bargains in South America from his time at PSV Eindhoven.
However, at £32 million, Soteldo would hardly be a bargain. But considering the potential ramifications of the global health crisis, Santos will undoubtedly be having to revise that previous price-tag. 
If Everton are looking to take a gamble on Soteldo, they may have to wait until he is done in Brazil. But it certainly seems the attacker would be open to a switch to England.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Juventus want to keep Dybala and Higuain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Juventus intend to keep Paulo Dybala "for as long as possible" and Gonzalo Higuain for the 2020-21 season, while Giorgio Chiellini and Gianluigi Buffon are set for contract extensions.
With Cristiano Ronaldo now the standout star in the Bianconeri team, fellow forwards Dybala and Higuain have repeatedly been linked with moves away from Turin.
Dybala was a reported target for Manchester United and Tottenham last year, while Higuain had appeared set for a permanent departure at the same stage as he returned from unsuccessful loan spells with Milan and then Chelsea.
The Argentina attackers have netted 21 Juve goals between them in all competitions this season, however, and sporting director Fabio Paratici is keen to see both men stay at the Bianconeri, who led Lazio by a point at the top of the Serie A table when the season was suspended in March.
Discussing potential new deals - including those for out-of-contract veterans Chiellini and Buffon - Paratici told Sky Sport Italia: "Chiellini and Buffon are in the pipeline.
"For Dybala, I think this pause has stopped our communications a little bit. But our will is to make him stay with us for as long as possible."
Dybala's deal runs out in 2022, but the club have been in talks over a new agreement for much of the 2019-20 season.
Meanwhile, Higuain, 32, is out of contract at the end of next season, yet Juventus are not looking to let the ex-Napoli striker depart early.
Paratici added: "Higuain left [Italy] and was very worried in general [about the coronavirus pandemic]. Gonzalo is a very sensitive boy and this thing struck him a lot.
"We are tied to him. He has had an extraordinary season. We hope for him to continue with us for the year that remains in the contract."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lautaro Martinez tells Inter Milan that he wants to join Barcelona</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lautaro has been heavily linked with Barcelona ever since their public interest in signing a striker as a permanent replacement to aging Luis Suarez. The Argentine has reportedly decided that he wants to move to the Nou Camp in the summer and will not be extending his stay at San Siro.
Inter, however, will not be letting go of their star striker that easily as they continue to demand an extravagant amount of fee. The Nerazzurri are ready to reduce their previous asking price and are ready to take £80 million for the 22-year-old.
Martinez has managed to score 16 goals in 31 appearances this season, enjoying his football alongside Romelu Lukaku who has scored 23 goals of his own. Despite the partnership, Lautaro has informed his club that he will be rejecting any contract renewal offered in order to secure a move to Barca.
The financial impact of COVID-19 on football clubs around the world has resulted in the lowered price but Blaugrana can still not afford the £80m and will look to offer players in exchange for an even reduced price.
Sport reports that the Italian side wants Arturo Vidal on a permanent move to San Siro, along with Antoine Grieizmann to join on loan for a year. It remains to be seen if Barca would consider such a deal as they would have to let their €120 million summer signing to be loaned out.
It is clear, however, that the Serie A giants will find it hard to keep hold of their superstar with Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain also interested in the youngster.
Would you let Arturo Vidal and Antoine Griezmann leave for Lautaro Martinez?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Transfer News: Barcelona ready to listen to offers for Luis Suarez amid coronavirus crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to a report from Spanish publication MARCA, La Liga champions Barcelona are willing to listen to offers for star striker Luis Suarez in the summer, with a number of clubs in the MLS interested.
Suarez has been with Barcelona for almost six years now, having signed from Liverpool back in 2014. The Uruguayan international has grown into one of the deadliest strikers in Europe during his stint at Camp Nou, helping the club to numerous trophies and titles.
Till date, the 33-year-old has bagged 191 goals and created 108 more in 270 matches for Barcelona. However, over the past couple of seasons, Suarez has shown signs of age catching up with him, with injuries hampering him quite often. In fact, the striker was unavailable since January this season as well, having undergone an operation on his knee.
In spite of his advancing years and injury issues, Suarez has continued to contribute heavily in the final third, having bagged 14 goals and 11 assists in just 23 matches in the 2019-20 season. However, Barcelona are now considering the possibility of offloading the veteran in the summer.
This move comes due to the fact that finances have been affected because of the coronavirus crisis. With the La Liga and Champions League suspended, Barcelona have been deprived of matchday income for almost two months now. The situation is unlikely to see a major improvement once the season resumes, as matches are likely to be played behind closed doors.
With Barcelona planning a huge summer outlay for the likes of Lautaro Martinez and Neymar, they are looking at player sales as a possible means of raising funds. And Suarez could be among a number of players who are likely be shown the doors at Camp Nou.
This development has put several clubs in the Major League Soccer (MLS) on high-alert. David Beckham’s Inter Miami are one of the suitors, with the former Manchester United and Real Madrid superstar having spoken about the possibility of signing Suarez in the past.
The 33-year-old veteran striker himself has admitted to being open to playing in the MLS one day. Suarez’s contract with Barcelona runs till 2021, with the club retaining the option of extending it by another year, provided he features in 60% of matches in the 2020-21 season.
Suarez remains a key player within the Barcelona setup and enjoys a great relationship with his teammates, especially club captain and talisman Lionel Messi. It now remains to be seen if the Catalans do go through with the sale of the former Liverpool man come summer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mourinho pushing hard for target – Tottenham will offer just slightly more than valuation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Takvim claim Tottenham Hotspur manager Jose Mourinho is pushing hard for Fenerbahce striker Vedat Muriqi, despite reported interest from Lazio and Napoli.
The Turkish newspaper claim Tottenham are ready to up their proposal for the 26 year old, and are willing to offer slightly more than €15m to sign the player. There have been recent reports Fener would accept offers in this region.
It’s stated Mourinho is directly behind the pursuit of the Kosovo international and has been pressing the Tottenham board to make an offer for the player. Spurs were said to be interested in signing the attacker before the arrival of the Portuguese coach, and had been linked with him last year.
This week we covered claims from Turkey that despite strong interest from Italy, Muriqi’s preference is to play in England if he leaves Fenerbahce.
The former Caykur Rizespor player has made 28 appearances this season, scoring 15 goals. His contract with the Yellow Canaries will expire at the end of June 2023.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Teqball - the game keeping soccer stars busy during lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Harry Maguire, Sadio Mane and Wayne Rooney are among the stars to have embraced teqball during the coronavirus lockdown — a mixture of football and table tennis that has quickly grown from a Hungarian garage to a burgeoning international sport.
What has long been a common sight at training grounds is increasingly becoming more frequent in players’ gardens as they look for a fun and challenging way of filling the void left by the Covid-19 lockdown.
From Neymar to England internationals such as Trent Alexander-Arnold, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham, numerous players past and present are embracing teqball at a time when the footballing landscape has been decimated.
“We miss football and all the players miss football — everyone misses football,” Viktor Huszar, one of three co-founders and inventors of teqball explains.
“This is just bringing back a piece, a little piece of football with teqball, joyful things.
“We see now, if you check Sadio Mane’s last picture, you see the football goals, all the different exercises... and the teqball table there.
“The same happens with many of the players that you see as part of their everyday training routine. This is how they keep up.”
The sport is the brainchild of former semi-professional player Gabor Borsanyi and Huszar, who took their love for football and adapted it to their limitations in terms of time, numbers and space by using a curved table tennis-style table to face one another.
During the current crisis, players have been training by folding the teqball table and playing off half of it, with the federation offering half-priced tables to Professional Footballers’ Association members.
Initially played between friends in a small garage in Hungary, continual positive feedback led the first prototype tables to be developed in 2014 and within three years the Federation Internationale de Teqball (FITEQ) was established.
The big moment came in 2015 when Barcelona great and current Holland manager Ronald Koeman gave the sport the thumbs up.
“Southampton, that’s the first table we have in the Premier League, ” the FITEQ chairman said, having visited the then Saints boss and assistant Erwin Koeman, the ex-Hungary manager.
“We never really pushed teqball, we just had some people and we asked what Ronald Koeman says because he is an experienced coach.
“When they said (they liked it), like Henk Ten Cate from Barcelona, Chelsea and Ajax, and Koeman, then we said ‘OK, if they say this is good and they worked with Messi and all these guys, then this actually really works’.
“That’s when we started to push it more as a structured organisation and then it went from one Premier League club to the other, one player to the other.
“And now, as I remember, we had 18 out of the 20 Premier League clubs or players using it, so sometimes I even say that probably teqball is the most advanced sports equipment with the Premier League clubs.”
Increasing numbers of players are embracing teqball and the third annual teqball world championships was held in December, just months before coronavirus changed the sporting world.
“We see that teqball is really a sports equipment that has the social distance type of sport,” Huszar said.
“Actually, the table is designed with three metres length, so you’re always minimum, three, three-and-a-half metres from each other.
“Teqball is about developing your touch and your cognitive skills because you have to make such quick decisions that you’re under pressure all the time.
“When you look at a football game, especially when you look at the youth football game, I mean, how many touches do you have for your kid? You know, maybe he touches 12 or 20 times during the game.
“But even Premier League players, they need that perfect touch and in teqball you get used to that — you literally get it every second and you just have to make sure that you have a quick reaction before you touch the ball.
“So, and I play teqball actively, like every day, for me this is a 50 per cent mental cognitive improvement and also basically just perfecting your skill and touch and coordination, balance on a very short platform.”
Teqball is growing as a sport as much as a recreational activity, with more than 50 national federations formed and 160 athletes from 57 countries at the most recent world championships.
“Now I see the pictures and the videos, and it is surreal,” Huszar added. “But certainly the early moments were the incredible ones
“I’m quite sure that teqball is still a very early stage sport because I also look at it as a sport. In terms of the development, it’s hard to keep up with that.
“I think that it’s unstoppable, so sometimes I even made jokes with the other two co-founders that, look, whatever we do, we don’t really have the chance to stop it.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Harry Maguire, Sadio Mane and Wayne Rooney are among the stars to have embraced teqball during the coronavirus lockdown - a mixture of football and table tennis that has quickly grown from a Hungarian garage to a burgeoning international sport.
What has long been a common sight at training grounds is increasingly becoming more frequent in players' gardens as they look for a fun and challenging way of filling the void left by the Covid-19 lockdown.
From Neymar to England internationals such as Trent Alexander-Arnold, Callum Hudson-Odoi and Tammy Abraham, numerous players past and present are embracing teqball at a time when the footballing landscape has been decimated.
"We miss football and all the players miss football - everyone misses football," Viktor Huszar, one of three co-founders and inventors of teqball, told the PA news agency.
"This is just bringing back a piece, a little piece of football with teqball, joyful things.
"We see now, if you check Sadio Mane's last picture, you see the football goals, all the different exercises... and the teqball table there.

    <h5 class="mb-1">McEvoy backs Vorster tactics, says Sunlight simply didn't turn up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Top trainer Tony McEvoy has slammed the critics who found fault with his jockey's tactics on beaten favourite Sunlight in Saturday's group 1 TAB Classic at Morphettville, declaring the top race mare had trailed in last because she simply decided to down tools and have a day off.
The trainer/jockey combination of McEvoy and Barend Vorster had landed two group 2 races earlier in the day, so their confidence was up and they opted for a radical approach to keep Sunlight wide on the track as she had to jump from barrier 14 in a 16-horse field.
But, explained McEvoy on Sunday, the now four-year-old has lost a little of her gate speed and is not as sharp as she once was, especially at the start of a sprint race like the 1200-metre Classic. Therefore the stable and the rider opted to try something different.
"For some reason she has decided not to go. All the people on Twitter and everyone saying the tactics were wrong and blaming Barend Vorster is completely ridiculous. That filly went in a straight line and was beaten before he started to turn, it's just rubbish," McEvoy said.
"We made a plan and it didn't work. It wasn't because of where we were on the track, it was simply that she decided not to have a go.
"She is not showing the speed she used to show, we know that. She showed in the Golden Eagle [a $7 million race over 1500 metres in which she finished second last spring] she's not [just] a sprinter any more.
"The problem with that was that at the 600m mark before we started to turn she was gone. He had no horse under him."
Vorster is the trainer's Adelaide stable rider and McEvoy is delighted with his overall contribution.
"Barend is really going well. He's such an asset to my team not only at the races but every day of the week with his feedback, he's got a great work ethic and I am so pleased with him."
Saturday aside, the trainer is undeterred and will almost certainly press on to the final group 1 race of the Adelaide carnival, the Goodwood on May 16, with Sunlight.
"I cannot find one reason [for her poor run]. She's perfect this morning, we trotted her up, flexed her up, looked over her, I looked at her closer this morning than I have looked at my wife for years," he joked.
"She's had a day off. Straight after the race the vets came and took her heart rate, it was under 120. Then it was under 100 soon after that. She didn't go. She did that in The Everest too. She had a shocker in The Everest.
"I will do some internal testing on her with a lung wash and we shall take some bloods, but she has eaten a maximum feed overnight, bright as a button this morning [Sunday] and has pulled up like a winner.
"She did it [put in a shocker] on the biggest day of her life in The Everest. I couldn't find a thing wrong and then she went to the Golden Eagle and ran probably the race of her life.
"If she's fine I am just going to go to the Goodwood and then we will make a decision after that about what we do."
McEvoy has a handful of other chances in the big races over the next fortnight.
"Silent Sovereign had no luck at all yesterday in the Oaks and I am considering backing her up in the Derby next weekend. Xilong won the Euclase Stakes and I think I will run her in the Goodwood."

But, explained McEvoy on Sunday, the now four-year-old has lost a little of her gate speed and is not as sharp as she once was, especially at the start of a sprint race like the 1200-metre Classic. Therefore the stable and the rider opted to try something different.
"For some reason she has decided not to go. All the people on Twitter and everyone saying the tactics were wrong and blaming Barend Vorster is completely ridiculous. That filly went in a straight line and was beaten before he started to turn, it's just rubbish," McEvoy said.
"We made a plan and it didn't work. It wasn't because of where we were on the track, it was simply that she decided not to have a go.
"She is not showing the speed she used to show, we know that. She showed in the Golden Eagle [a $7 million race over 1500 metres in which she finished second last spring] she's not [just] a sprinter any more.
"The problem with that was that at the 600m mark before we started to turn she was gone. He had no horse under him."
Vorster is the trainer's Adelaide stable rider and McEvoy is delighted with his overall contribution.
"Barend is really going well. He's such an asset to my team not only at the races but every day of the week with his feedback, he's got a great work ethic and I am so pleased with him."
Saturday aside, the trainer is undeterred and will almost certainly press on to the final group 1 race of the Adelaide carnival, the Goodwood on May 16, with Sunlight.
"I cannot find one reason [for her poor run]. She's perfect this morning, we trotted her up, flexed her up, looked over her, I looked at her closer this morning than I have looked at my wife for years," he joked.
"She's had a day off. Straight after the race the vets came and took her heart rate, it was under 120. Then it was under 100 soon after that. She didn't go. She did that in The Everest too. She had a shocker in The Everest.
"I will do some internal testing on her with a lung wash and we shall take some bloods, but she has eaten a maximum feed overnight, bright as a button this morning [Sunday] and has pulled up like a winner.
"She did it [put in a shocker] on the biggest day of her life in The Everest. I couldn't find a thing wrong and then she went to the Golden Eagle and ran probably the race of her life.
"If she's fine I am just going to go to the Goodwood and then we will make a decision after that about what we do."
McEvoy has a handful of other chances in the big races over the next fortnight.
"Silent Sovereign had no luck at all yesterday in the Oaks and I am considering backing her up in the Derby next weekend. Xilong won the Euclase Stakes and I think I will run her in the Goodwood."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Sunil Chhetri has helped a fan get free Netflix subscription and a personally signed jersey after the latter requested the Indian football team captain and star striker to share his user ID and password.
Taking to Twitter, Chhetri had posted a screenshot of a message he received on Facebook and wrote: "Jersey X Autograph on a picture X Reply to the post X Video wishing the neighbour's son's pet dog X. Here's someone who has priorities straight and it's really making me want to consider the demand."
Netflix India's Twitter handle took note of this message from Chhetri and they replied: "While we on that topic, could we also get your autograph on a picture?"

Chhetri then proposed a barter deal asking for a two-month free subscription for the fan in return for an autographed jersey from him.
His post read: "In the true spirit of a barter, how about you guys hand the kid a two-month subscription and I will send a signed shirt and a picture your way? Do we have a deal?"
In reply, Netflix India's Twitter handle posted: "How about we send him both the jersey and a subscription card? Let's make his day."
To this, Chhetri replied: "Sounds great guys, now that we've got this figured out. Subscription for the kid, Shirt for the kid, Shirt for you guys."
Earlier, in a series of tweets, Chhetri had announced that the members of the Indian team had come together and 'put on table a sum that has been sent to the PM-Cares Fund' to help in the fight against coronavirus.

"It's been heartening to see everyone -- cutting across caps, goals, age and experience -- give, and give with a smile. When word got out, even some who have long stopped pulling on an India shirt, turned up and asked to be counted.
"That's what a team is all about. The ONLY reason we're talking about this here is so that it can gently prod those who have been fortunate enough to get, to give back. We're in this together," he added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sunil Chhetri, the Indian football team captain, took to Twitter on Saturday and shared a bizarre request made by a fan on one of his social media platforms. A fan sent a message to Sunil Chhetri requesting him to share his Netflix password. "Here's someone who has priorities straight and it's really making me want to consider the demand," Sunil Chhetri tweeted with the screenshot of the message sent by his fan.
Soon, Sunil Chhetri's Twitter followers started to react and appreciated the footballer's sense of humour.
Recently, Sunil Chhetri was picked among 28 past and present stars for FIFA's campaign to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. 
FIFA and the World Health Organization (WHO) teamed up to combat the coronavirus by launching a new awareness campaign led by world-renowned footballers, who are calling on all people around the world to follow five key steps to stop the spread of the disease. 
Sunil Chhetri also featured in an Asian Football Confederation (AFC) campaign to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and requested people to do all they can to overcome "these challenging times". 
"Let's work together - as a team - to break the chain and stop the spread of COVID-19. I stand with everyone in India and around the world to put these challenging times behind us and hope that we can all return to our normal lives soon," said Chhetri.
Chhetri is only behind Cristiano Ronaldo and leads the likes of mega superstars such as Lionel Messi in the international goalscoring charts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Club owners optimistic about Fox Sports' A-League appetite</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A-League club owners are hopeful the competition's long-term relationship with Fox Sports can be salvaged, with arrangements for the resumption of the season set to progress this week.
As revealed by the Herald, Football Federation Australia has belatedly received the near $12 million quarterly payment from Fox that was due last month after tense discussions led by chief executive James Johnson.
The money enables planning for the final rounds of the A-League season to move ahead, with FFA and the clubs waiting on Friday's national cabinet meeting before finalising the specifics of when, where and how matches will be played.
Perth Glory chairman Tony Sage said his fellow club owners were "very happy" that Fox had paid FFA and was optimistic that the three seasons left on the A-League's broadcast deal would be honoured.
That Fox has not yet walked away from football, despite having had the opportunity to do so, was a positive sign, Sage said.
"To be fair to Fox, they've had a lot on their plate," Sage told the Herald.
"They're in massive negotiations with their two big sports - as a football person I don't like saying it, but it's true, AFL and NRL, they're big sports for them. They've had a lot to deal with and maybe the A-League just got shunted down the pile a little bit, which is frustrating, but understandable.
"Hopefully they want to continue on. I would have expected if they didn't pay they wouldn't continue but the fact that they've paid, it may be the same as with the AFL and NRL and they just want to renegotiate."
Sage also hailed Johnson's performance as FFA chief, giving him "full marks" for the job he's done since starting in January, just weeks before the COVID-19 epidemic tipped the sporting industry on its head.
Industry sources suggest Fox has been equally impressed by Johnson's handling of such a difficult and uncertain situation, and for treating the company's 15-year partnership with the A-League with respect.
"I give him full marks for what he's done," Sage said. "Patience, conservatism is what we've needed. Like [AFL chief executive] Gillon McLachlan, he didn't go out like a bull at a gate and maybe inflame situations. We're very lucky that the FFA managed to nab him."
Sage said A-League clubs were expecting to return to training on or around July 1, with no games likely to be played until August.
That would give FFA enough time to strike a long-term resolution with Fox, and to also negotiate with Professional Footballers Australia over pay cuts for players and for the short-term extension of contracts beyond May 31.
"The PFA have been, other than that one I letter I got very early, very good," said Sage, who drew the union's ire by becoming the first A-League owner to stand down their squad. "They've been very patient, waiting for number one, the Fox payment to be made ... but we won't be generating any more revenue for those games, it will just be a cost."
A-League owners will also meet this week to discuss next steps, with clubs likely to receive smaller distributions from FFA because of steep declines in revenue across the board in football.
Sage said FFA had not yet discussed resumption plans with the clubs, but he was anticipating the 'hub model' being contemplated by the AFL and NRL was highly likely for the A-League.
"It makes sense to me that it's all in one location so that the health and safety of the players can be controlled," Sage said.
"There was a plan already put in place by the FFA before this happened - we were going to play it out until everything went pear-shaped. I presume they'll just dust off that plan, and that plan was for the clubs to go to NSW."
Meanwhile, Sage laughed off reports from abroad that put forward Perth as a possible location for the English Premier League season to be completed.
The Sun newspaper claimed Gary Williams, an English agent based in Perth, had received support from some Premier League clubs and government officials for the ambitious proposal.
"Seriously, if anyone has any sort of belief that that is even in the realms of consideration ... it's just ridiculous," Sage said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Club owners optimistic about Fox Sports' A-League appetite</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A-League club owners are hopeful the competition's long-term relationship with Fox Sports can be salvaged, with arrangements for the resumption of the season set to progress this week.
As revealed by the Herald, Football Federation Australia has belatedly received the near $12 million quarterly payment from Fox that was due last month after tense discussions led by chief executive James Johnson.
The money enables planning for the final rounds of the A-League season to move ahead, with FFA and the clubs waiting on Friday's national cabinet meeting before finalising the specifics of when, where and how matches will be played.
Perth Glory chairman Tony Sage said his fellow club owners were "very happy" that Fox had paid FFA and was optimistic that the three seasons left on the A-League's broadcast deal would be honoured.
That Fox has not yet walked away from football, despite having had the opportunity to do so, was a positive sign, Sage said.
"To be fair to Fox, they've had a lot on their plate," Sage told the Herald.
"They're in massive negotiations with their two big sports - as a football person I don't like saying it, but it's true, AFL and NRL, they're big sports for them. They've had a lot to deal with and maybe the A-League just got shunted down the pile a little bit, which is frustrating, but understandable.
"Hopefully they want to continue on. I would have expected if they didn't pay they wouldn't continue but the fact that they've paid, it may be the same as with the AFL and NRL and they just want to renegotiate."
Sage also hailed Johnson's performance as FFA chief, giving him "full marks" for the job he's done since starting in January, just weeks before the COVID-19 epidemic tipped the sporting industry on its head.
Industry sources suggest Fox has been equally impressed by Johnson's handling of such a difficult and uncertain situation, and for treating the company's 15-year partnership with the A-League with respect.
"I give him full marks for what he's done," Sage said. "Patience, conservatism is what we've needed. Like [AFL chief executive] Gillon McLachlan, he didn't go out like a bull at a gate and maybe inflame situations. We're very lucky that the FFA managed to nab him."
Sage said A-League clubs were expecting to return to training on or around July 1, with no games likely to be played until August.
That would give FFA enough time to strike a long-term resolution with Fox, and to also negotiate with Professional Footballers Australia over pay cuts for players and for the short-term extension of contracts beyond May 31.
"The PFA have been, other than that one I letter I got very early, very good," said Sage, who drew the union's ire by becoming the first A-League owner to stand down their squad. "They've been very patient, waiting for number one, the Fox payment to be made ... but we won't be generating any more revenue for those games, it will just be a cost."
A-League owners will also meet this week to discuss next steps, with clubs likely to receive smaller distributions from FFA because of steep declines in revenue across the board in football.
Sage said FFA had not yet discussed resumption plans with the clubs, but he was anticipating the 'hub model' being contemplated by the AFL and NRL was highly likely for the A-League.
"It makes sense to me that it's all in one location so that the health and safety of the players can be controlled," Sage said.
"There was a plan already put in place by the FFA before this happened - we were going to play it out until everything went pear-shaped. I presume they'll just dust off that plan, and that plan was for the clubs to go to NSW."
Meanwhile, Sage laughed off reports from abroad that put forward Perth as a possible location for the English Premier League season to be completed.
The Sun newspaper claimed Gary Williams, an English agent based in Perth, had received support from some Premier League clubs and government officials for the ambitious proposal.
"Seriously, if anyone has any sort of belief that that is even in the realms of consideration ... it's just ridiculous," Sage said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Big Egos Not Harmful If There Is Team Culture, Environment: Mahela Jayawardene</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cricket News
Written By Press Trust Of India | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 08:09 IST
Sri Lankan batting great Mahela Jayawardene says there is "nothing harmful" in having players with big egos in a team as long as he is able to get the best out of them within an ideal environment. Jayawardene has achieved considerable success in leadership roles in recent years, first as a captain and then coach, and said he has always backed his players to the hilt. Helming the affairs in a team-game like cricket, Jayawardene was asked how does he deal with big egos. 
The 42-year-old is one of Sri Lanka's most successful captains. Speaking further on handling players with big egos, he said, "It's about treating everyone professionally, and about treating everyone with respect. It is a team culture that you create.  "Once you create that culture, it's hard for an individual to go beyond that.  "The rest of the players will bring that person down to the group level. If you haven't created that team environment, then you can have a problem because there are no boundaries and people drift."
Under his guidance, Mumbai Indians have won two titles in the last three editions of IPL.  He said experience is one of things that has helped Mumbai Indians thrive during his time. "We try to make everybody involved in the processes. The thing with Mumbai is that a lot of guys have a lot of experience. There are very few young guys - about three or four - but those guys also have played a lot of first-class cricket and are mature players.  "So you try and encourage everyone to contribute. It's always good for the captain to get ideas, and at the end of the day it's he who has to make the call, but the more ideas he gets (from others), it influences his thought process."

Helming the affairs in a team-game like cricket, Jayawardene was asked how does he deal with big egos. “It’s good to have that. It’s nothing harmful. It’s about identifying and making sure that they thrive. Everyone has got to this level because they are good, right? So you try and get them to prove that. That’s all you need to do,” Jayawardene was quoted as saying by ESPNcricinfo.

“It hasn’t happened. I’m very honest with whatever I do. We can have brutally honest conversations. Nothing is personal with me. “You just need to cultivate that mutual respect. If the transparency is there and there are no agendas, the players understand that. “I also back the players to the hilt, whether as a captain or a coach. I’m always on the players’ side,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How every idea to complete the Championship season affects Nottingham Forest</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nottingham Forest's season has been decimated by the coronavirus crisis but discussions around a conclusion to the campaign are ongoing.
A number of ideas to conclude the Championship season have been floated, with the league continuing to discuss potential plans with their stakeholders, though the timeframe to come to a decision is very tight.
While the preference is for the season to be completed and all matches played, there are a number of difficult issues to navigate through and, with every proposed plan, there are pros and cons.
Here, we have gone through all of the options, the positives and negatives of each approach, and how they would affect Sabri Lamouchi's promotion hopefuls.
The preferred option for the Championship, which would see all 92 remaining league matches played behind closed doors at clubs' home stadiums – and not at neutral venues, as ruled out by EFL chairman Rick Parry on Friday. It would see the season expanded into the summer months.
Pros: No arguments in regard to number of matches played, can help to provide a morale boost to the country.
Cons: There are questions over the health and safety of the players, coaches and staff, as well as criticisms of mass testing in the current environment outside of football.
Good news for Forest? Yes. Forest could play their final nine games of the season and hopefully retain their place in the play-off spots, providing a chance for promotion back to the Premier League.
The league table is frozen and the current standings are taken as final, with the bottom three relegated, Leeds United and West Brom promoted.
Pros: Draws a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would be unaffected. Takes into account every match played so far.
Cons: Would immediately turn into a legal minefield, integrity of the competition would be questioned, particularly as it disregards the remaining matches on the fixture list.
Good news for Forest? No. Forest would stay fifth, but this method is only going to be used if matches cannot played, meaning there would be no play-offs. Either the top two, and only the top two, are promoted, or Fulham also go up from third.
The nuclear option, and one that has already been put in place in the National League and with Holland’s Eredivisie, is to declare the entire campaign null and void – wiping this seasons records, with no champions or relegation.
Pros: A clean break, drawing a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would be unaffected. No legal challenges from clubs that feel they have been harshly relegated.
Cons: Harsh on those who have performed well this season. Opens the door to legal action from broadcasters and sponsors, who could deny payments or demand refunds.
Good news for Forest? No. This would signal another campaign in the Championship for Forest, with their fine season scrubbed from records.
This method would only take the first 23 games of the season into consideration, which would mean each team has played against each other once and sit on an even amount of matches played.
Pros: Based on actual results, an even amount of games played and the same opponents faced.
Cons: Arguments based on home and away matches, questions over whether 23 games is a fair table.
Good news for Forest? In this scenario, Forest would finish eighth, some way from promotion, which is far from ideal.
The current league table would be made final, with no sides relegated, but with the top two from League One coming up. If the Premier League do not agree to an expanded division and do not allow promotion-chasing Leeds and West Brom to go up, the Championship would be swelled to 26 sides.
Pros: Draws a line under the current season, doesn’t cause legal action in regards to relegation.
Cons: Expanded league adds to increased fixture congestion next season, unfair on those within Championship play-off spots, would need to be put in place across the EFL.
Good news for Forest? Nope. Forest would miss out on promotion, and with more teams in the division next term, a greater proportion of sides, five out of 26, will be relegated, meaning Forest would be at greater risk of dropping into League One.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The football season has been decimated by the coronavirus crisis but discussions around a conclusion to the campaign are continuing to orientate.
A number of ideas to conclude the Premier League season have been floated, with the league continuing to discuss potential plans with their stakeholders, though the timeframe to come to a decision is very tight.
Everton are still able to qualify for Europe and Liverpool are two wins away from the title, and both clubs are said to back plans to restart the action.
While the preference is for the season to be completed and all matches played, there are a number of difficult issues to navigate through and, with every proposed plan, there are pros and cons.
Here, we have gone through all of the options along with the positives and negatives of each approach.
The preferred option for the Premier League, which would see all 92 remaining league matches played in neutral venues and behind closed doors - with the season expanded into the summer months.
Pros: No arguments in regards to amount of matches played, can help to provide a morale boost to the country.
Cons: Neutral venues would likely lead to arguments, questions over the health and safety of the players, coaches and staff, criticisms of mass testing in the current environment outside of football.
This method produces a final table by dividing a teams’ current points tally by games played to get a points-per-game average, with goal difference then used as a deciding factor if any clubs have the same total.
Pros: Simple to work out, takes into effect every match already played this season and league table doesn’t alter significantly.
Cons: Relegated teams would certainly appeal, disregards the remaining matches on the fixture list.
The league table is frozen and the current standings are taken as final, with the bottom three relegated, European spots decided and Liverpool crowned champions. Has already been used in France’s Ligue 1.
Pros: Draws a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would be unaffected.
Cons: Would immediately turn into a legal minefield, integrity of the competition would be questioned.
The nuclear option, and one that has already been put in place in the National League and with Holland’s Eredivisie, is to declare the entire campaign null and void - wiping this seasons records, with no champions or relegation.
A solution would be required to decide the representatives for the European competitions in 2020/21 and it would also require the EFL to take the same approach on their campaigns.
Pros: A clean break, drawing a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would be unaffected.
Cons: Harsh on those who have performed well this season. Opens the door to legal action from broadcasters and sponsors, who could deny payments or demand refunds.
This method would only take the first 19 games of the season into consideration, which would mean each team has played against each other once and sit on an even amount of matches played.

Cons: Arguments based on home and away matches, questions over whether 19 games is a fair table.
The current league table would be made final, with Liverpool champions and the European qualification spots would be decided. The difference is that the bottom three would not be relegated, with Leeds United and West Brom promoted from the Championship.
Pros: Draws a line under the current season, doesn’t cause legal action in regards to relegation.
Cons: Expanded league adds to increased fixture congestion next season, unfair on those within Championship playoff spots, would need to be put in place across the EFL.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The football season has been decimated by the coronavirus crisis but discussions around a conclusion to the campaign are continuing.
Derby County currently sit 12th in the Championship. They are five points outside the top six with nine games left to play.
Their last game was the 3-0 home victory over Blackburn Rovers on March 8.
A number of ideas to conclude the Championship season have been floated with the League discussing potential plans with their stakeholders.

Pros: Draws a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would be unaffected.
Cons: Would immediately turn into a legal minefield, integrity of the competition would be questioned, unclear on what would happen to the third promotion spot.

While the preference is for the season to be completed and all matches played, there are a number of difficult issues to navigate through and, with every proposed plan, there are pros and cons.
As things stand, Cardiff City and Swansea City sit two and three points off the play-off spots respectively, while West Brom and Leeds United sit pretty in the automatic promotion spots.
Here, we have gone through all of the options along with the positives and negatives of each approach.
Behind closed doors
The preferred option for the Championship, which would see all 92 remaining league matches played at neutral venues and behind closed doors - with the season expanded into the summer months.
Pros: No arguments in regards to number of matches played, can help to provide a morale boost to the country.
Cons: Neutral venues would likely lead to arguments, questions over the health and safety of the players, coaches and staff, criticisms of mass testing in the current environment outside of football.
Points per game
This method produces a final table by dividing a teams’ current points tally by games played to get a points-per-game average, with goal difference then used as a deciding factor if any clubs have the same total.
Pros: Simple to work out, takes into effect every match already played this season and league table doesn’t alter significantly.
Cons: Relegated teams would certainly appeal, disregards the remaining matches on the fixture list.
Cancellation with current standings
The league table is frozen and the current standings are taken as final, with the bottom three relegated, Leeds United and West Brom promoted.
Pros: Draws a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would be unaffected.
Cons: Would immediately turn into a legal minefield, integrity of the competition would be questioned, unclear on what would happen to the third promotion spot.
Null and void
The nuclear option, and one that has already been put in place in the National League and with Holland’s Eredivisie, is to declare the entire campaign null and void - wiping this season's records, with no champions nor relegation.
A solution would be required to decide the representatives for European competitions in 2020/21 and it would also require the EFL to take the same approach on their campaigns.
Pros: A clean break, drawing a line under the season. The transfer window can go ahead with the current dates and the start of next season would, hopefully, be unaffected.
Cons: Harsh on those who have performed well this season. Opens the door to legal action from broadcasters and sponsors, who could deny payments or demand refunds.
The 19-game table
This method would only take the first 19 games of the season into consideration, which would mean each team has played against each other once and sit on an even amount of matches played.
Pros: Based on actual results, an even amount of games played and the same opponents faced.
Cons: Arguments based on home and away matches, questions over whether 19 games is a fair table.
No relegation, 22 teams next season
The current league table would be made final, with Leeds United and West Brom promoted into an expanded 22-team Premier League next season. No relegation, with a 26-team Championship in the 2020/21 campaign.
Pros: Draws a line under the current season, doesn’t cause legal action in regards to relegation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Career-threatening eye injury failed to dent Reena Khokar's spirit to play for Indian hockey team</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BENGALURU: Indian women's team midfielder Reena Khokar had a mishap during a gym session in April last year that could have ended her career but her will to fight the uncertainty made it possible for her to wear the India jersey again.
"I was using a stretch-band to do some simple flexibility exercise when the band snapped and hit my left eye. It happened so quickly that I had no time to react. At that time, little did I know that the next four months would be the worse phase of my life," said Reena, who made her India debut against New Zealand in 2017.
The player possesses exceptional defensive skills, was a regular feature in the Indian squad since she made her debut in 2017. She was part of the team that won the silver medal at the 2018 Asian Games and also played the FIH Women's World Cup earlier that year.
Her progress in the team was steadfast until the mishap in 2019 which cast doubt on whether she can be ready for the all-important Olympic Qualifier later that year.

"Initially the doctor had said it will heal soon but even after a month when the pain was persistent, the doctor then advised surgery to rule out permanent damage to the retina. This news was devastating and all I could think of was whether I will ever play hockey again," stated the 26-year-old from Chandigarh.
After a brief break, Reena returned to the national camp in July.
"I was advised two months bed rest and when I returned to the camp chief coach Sjoerd would talk to me regularly to pep me up. He would tell me about a player in Netherlands who played hockey with vision only in one eye. Positive stories like these and emotional support from my parents and some close friends outside of hockey kept me motivated. When I held the stick again, after almost three months, I knew I would do anything to return to the team and I am thankful to the coaching staff who supported me with step-by-step return to full training and didn't put any kind of pressure," she expressed.
To the surprise of many, Reena was available for FIH Olympic Qualifiers selections as she had made her comeback in the Test Event held in Tokyo in August 2019 where India was victorious. Though in December, she went through another corrective surgery, the danger had passed and Reena now vies to make best use of this year to earn a place in the Tokyo-bound Indian side.
"I got a break in the Indian team quite late. I was around 24 when I made my India debut and my junior India experience is less, so the next one year I will do everything I can do prove myself worthy of a place in the Olympic-bound India squad," Reena said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">After Injury And Eye Surgeries, Reena Eyes Olympics Selection</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hockey news
Written By Press Trust Of India | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 07:53 IST
A gym session gone awry has threatened to end her career but after two eye surgeries and months away from the game, mid-fielder Reena is looking at selection in Indian women's hockey team for the Tokyo Olympics. Reena, who was a regular feature in the Indian squad since her debut in 2017, fought her way through the challenging times with strong will and a tremendous support system. "I was using a stretch-band to do some simple flexibility exercise when the band snapped and hit my left eye. It happened so quickly that I had no time to react. At that time, little did I know that the next four months would be the worse phase of my life," recalled Reena.
To the surprise of many, Reena was available for FIH Olympic Qualifiers selections, having made her comeback in the Test Event in Tokyo in August 2019. She went through another corrective surgery in December, but the danger had passed by then. "I got a break in the Indian team quite late. I was around 24 when I made my India debut and my junior India experience is less, so the next one year I will do everything I can do prove myself worthy of a place in the Olympic-bound India squad," she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">After eye surgeries, midfielder Reena looks to seal spot in Indian hockey team for Tokyo Olympics</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A gym session gone awry had threatened to end her career but after two eye surgeries and months away from the game, midfielder Reena Khokhar is looking at sealing her place in Indian women’s hockey team for the Tokyo Olympics.
Reena, who was a regular feature in the Indian squad since her debut in 2017, fought her way through the challenging times with strong will and a tremendous support system.

“I was using a stretch-band to do some simple flexibility exercise when the band snapped and hit my left eye. It happened so quickly that I had no time to react. At that time, little did I know that the next four months would be the worse phase of my life,” recalled Reena.
She was part of the team that won the silver medal at the 2018 Asian Games and also played the FIH Women’s World Cup in the same year. She was going along nicely until the mishap in 2019, which cast a doubt on her participation in the all-important Olympic Qualifier.
“Initially the doctor has said it will heal soon but even after a month when the pain was persistent, the doctor then advised surgery to rule out permanent damage to the retina. This news was devastating and all I could think of was whether I will ever play hockey again,” said the 26-year-old Reena, who is from Chandigarh.
After a brief break, Reena returned to the national camp in July.
“I was advised two months bed rest and when I returned to the camp chief coach Sjoerd would talk to me regularly to pep me up. He would tell me about a player in Netherlands who played hockey with vision only in one eye.
“Positive stories like these and emotional support from my parents and some close friends outside of hockey kept me motivated.
“When I held the stick again, after almost three months, I knew I would do anything to return to the team and I am thankful to the coaching staff who supported me with step-by-step return to full training and didn’t put any kind of pressure,” she said.
To the surprise of many, Reena was available for FIH Olympic Qualifiers selections, having made her comeback in the Test Event in Tokyo in August 2019.
She went through another corrective surgery in December, but the danger had passed by then.
“I got a break in the Indian team quite late. I was around 24 when I made my India debut and my junior India experience is less, so the next one year I will do everything I can do prove myself worthy of a place in the Olympic-bound India squad,” she said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cillian Sheridan trusts correct measures will be taken ahead of training return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Ireland striker Cillian Sheridan has dismissed fears about returning to training during the coronavirus crisis.
The 31-year-old is due to begin working in small groups with club Wisla Plock in Poland on Monday.
The Ekstraklasa could resume on May 29 if a five-step plan for the country goes ahead, which includes schools and gyms reopening.
Sergio Aguero has raised his concerns about returning to action while three Cologne players have tested positive for Covid-19 after resuming training.
But former Celtic forward Sheridan, who has three caps for Ireland, remains confident.
He told the PA news agency: “It hasn’t been in my thoughts, that part of it, but I can understand people who will be feeling that. Even now it’s not something I’d really be thinking of and, at the same time, I trust what they’re doing.
“The league and FA know the risks if they are making players come back to play. They won’t want to put players’ health at risk. They are going to put things in place to make sure it’s safe for everyone coming back.
“We’ve had to fill in a medical report every day which gets sent to the league so they have been monitoring every player for the last week. They are going to do it for two weeks and as soon as someone flags something up they have to go and isolate.
“As far as I know there are no players here who have caught it here.”
Poland started relaxing some restrictions last month, reopening forests and parks and also outdoor sports areas.
It is hoped full team training will restart in around a week and Sheridan, who moved to Plock in February after a spell with Ironi Kiryat Shmona in Israel, believes players must take responsibility.
“All the players want to get back. Everyone is doing what they need to do,” said the Ireland international, who has taken a pay cut. “The players know it could hurt the clubs if the season isn’t finished, which in turn will hurt the players.
“Everyone has bought into how important it is.
“It’ll be a game very three days, it’s not something you’re ever going to do.“It’ll be interesting how teams manage the games and injuries
“If we have three games in a week, normally you’d have two or three days off but that’s not going to come now.”
The top eight sides play in the championship round while the bottom eight play to avoid relegation with the league hoping to boost its viewers once it returns.
“The aim was to get into the top eight, we’re a point away. If we can win two of the games it should get us there,” said Sheridan, who previously played in Poland for Jagiellonia.
“I think the league has been negotiating to sell the rights to the other countries because they’ll be one of the few playing. Everyone’s going to be wanting to watch sport so they are hopefully going to capitalise on that.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fergus McFadden to retire from rugby at the end of the season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fergus McFadden has announced that he will retire from rugby at the end of the season.
McFadden scored 10 tries in his 34 Ireland appearances. In his 13 year Leinster career he played 184 games to date, famously replacing Brian O'Driscoll when the great man retired.
The Kildare native has scored 29 tries but also kicked 46 conversions, 68 penalties and got a drop-goal against Cardiff back in 2011.
Speaking to the Leinster Rugby website, McFadden acknowledged all those that had played a part in his career to date, while also thanking the Leinster Rugby supporters.
“They say the best time to leave a party is when you’re still having fun so the time has come for me to announce my retirement from the end of the season.
"It’s hard to put into words what a privilege it has been to have had such a long career playing for the team I grew up supporting and pulling on a green jersey to play for my country. It has been a dream come true.
“So, reflecting on what made this all possible, I would like to thank all the Leinster Rugby staff, Leo Cullen, the wider management team, medics, physios, strength & conditioning coaches, backroom staff and our legendary bagman Johnny O’Hagan.
"Leinster’s incredible success over many years has been as a result of the contributions of the entire team both on and off the field.
“To the players, there are too many for me to name individually right now but all I can say is that it has been an honour to play and work alongside such incredibly talented and professional people.
"The friendships and memories I have made are ones I will cherish for the rest of my life – not to mention the many laughs we had along the way!
“To the Leinster fans…I don’t think you could ask for better supporters. Your constant support and encouragement was felt throughout – not only there to celebrate the highs but also to support through the lows.
“To my wife Rebecca, my son Freddy, my parents, my friends and family, thanks for being there every step of the way.”
Everyone’s in the Team Of Us.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fergus McFadden retires from rugby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Leinster Rugby back Fergus McFadden has this morning announced his decision to retire from professional rugby at the end of the season. Speaking to Peter O’Reilly in today’s Sunday Times, the 184 times capped Kildare native confirmed his decision to retire whenever the 2019/20 season concludes.

McFadden made his debut for Leinster Rugby in the number 13 jersey against Cardiff Blues in September 2007, but of course over the next 13 years, McFadden would play in numerous positions and this versatility was one of the traits that Leinster Rugby Head Coach Leo Cullen was keen to praise when looking back on McFadden’s career.
“Fergus has been an amazing contributor to lots of great things that have taken place in Leinster and Irish rugby and he’s definitely one of the great characters that we’ve had around in the group.
RugbyPass takes you behind the scenes at the 2018 PRO14 final:
“The versatility piece that Fergus has is hugely important. It can go against some players and tough calls not going their way but he would always do what’s best for the team. For example, even though typically your ten would take kicks, Fergus had no problem stepping up at crucial moments to take the pressure off someone. He had so many strings to his bow and he’s going to be a great loss to the group.”
To underline his importance to the Leinster cause, in his 184 games to date, McFadden has scored 29 tries but also kicked 46 conversions, 68 penalties and even a drop-goal against Cardiff in 2011.
His form in the blue of Leinster was rewarded with an Ireland debut against Italy in the 2011 Six Nations and he would go on to win a further 33 caps for Ireland scoring ten tries.
Over the course of a glittering career McFadden contributed to some great days for Leinster and Ireland and his standing within the environment of Leinster was also acknowledged by Cullen this morning.

“When the Ireland Rugby World Cup squad was announced during the year we posed some questions to the group of players that were left behind to form a leadership group and Fergus came out very high in that process and is still in that leadership group currently.
“That leadership group is based off some questions that we would ask the wider playing group. What do they value? Who lives those values day in, day out? Who do they want in the dressing room sitting beside them?
“You always had a sense for how highly Fergus was regarded amongst his peers and this process just confirmed what we already thought.”
During his time at Leinster, McFadden contributed on the biggest of days including playing in the 2011 Heineken Cup Final against Northampton Saints and starting in the 2012 Heineken Cup Final against Ulster, the 2013 Challenge Cup Final and the 2013 and 2014 PRO12 Finals.
He was also a key member of the Leinster double winning season in 2017/18 playing 17 times and scoring three tries until a hamstring injury in the Heineken Champions Cup Semi-Final win over Scarlets – in the act of scoring a try – cut short his season.
For Ireland, McFadden was a member of the 2011 Rugby World Cup squad, scoring a try against Russia in the pool games, and he was also a member of the Ireland Six Nations winning squads in 2014 and 2018.
This season McFadden has scored two tries in six appearances for Leinster to date and given the current suspension of the rugby season, Cullen noted that McFadden may yet see action again, but wished his former team-mate the very best of luck when he does formally retire.
“We are being guided by public health guidelines at the moment but naturally the hope is that Fergus gets the chance to pull on the Leinster jersey again.
“Regardless of what happens though, we sincerely thank him for his efforts over the years and wish himself, Rebecca and their little boy Freddy the very best of luck.
“I’ve known Fergus a long time and his parents and my own parents would have agonised in the stands together as they watched their sons on the pitch so we wish all of them the very best of luck in the future and hopefully we will continue to keep those connections back to Leinster Rugby strong.”
Speaking to leinsterrugby.ie this morning, McFadden acknowledged all those had had played a part in his career to date, while also thanking the Leinster Rugby supporters.
“They say the best time to leave a party is when you’re still having fun so the time has come for me to announce my retirement from the end of the season. It’s hard to put into words what a privilege it has been to have had such a long career playing for the team I grew up supporting and pulling on a green jersey to play for my country.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leinster and Ireland back Fergus McFadden to retire when the season ends</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">FERGUS MCFADDEN HAS announced that he will retire professional rugby once the 2019-20 season comes to a conclusion.
In addition to earning 34 caps for Ireland, the versatile 33-year-old back has made 184 appearances for Leinster since making his debut in September 2007.
“They say the best time to leave a party is when you’re still having fun so the time has come for me to announce my retirement from the end of the season,” McFadden said.
“It’s hard to put into words what a privilege it has been to have had such a long career playing for the team I grew up supporting and pulling on a green jersey to play for my country. It has been a dream come true.
“So, reflecting on what made this all possible, I would like to thank all the Leinster Rugby staff, Leo Cullen, the wider management team, medics, physios, strength and conditioning coaches, backroom staff and our legendary bagman Johnny O’Hagan.

“To the Leinster fan, I don’t think you could ask for better supporters. Your constant support and encouragement was felt throughout – not only there to celebrate the highs but also to support through the lows.
“To my wife Rebecca, my son Freddy, my parents, my friends and family, thanks for being there every step of the way.”
McFadden played in Leinster’s Heineken Cup final wins of both 2011 and ’12. He missed out on the victory in the 2018 decider after sustaining an injury while scoring a try in the semi-final win against Scarlets. The Kildare native also started in Leinster’s Pro12 final victories in 2013 and ’14.
Leinster head coach Leo Cullen paid tribute to the versatility of McFadden, who has scored 29 tries, 46 conversions and 68 penalties – as well as a drop goal against Cardiff in 2011 – during his time with the province.
“Fergus has been an amazing contributor to lots of great things that have taken place in Leinster and Irish rugby and he’s definitely one of the great characters that we’ve had around in the group,” said Cullen said.
“The versatility that Fergus has is hugely important. It can go against some players and tough calls not going their way but he would always do what’s best for the team. For example, even though typically your ten would take kicks, Fergus had no problem stepping up at crucial moments to take the pressure off someone. He had so many strings to his bow and he’s going to be a great loss to the group.”
At international level, McFadden made his debut against Italy in 2011 before going on to feature in the Ireland squads that won the Six Nations in 2014 and ’18. He also went to the 2011 World Cup, scoring a try in the defeat of Russia.
In spite of the uncertainty over the status of the 2019-20 season amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Cullen hopes that Leinster fans will get an opportunity to give McFadden a proper send-off.
He said: “We are being guided by public health guidelines at the moment but naturally the hope is that Fergus gets the chance to pull on the Leinster jersey again.
“Regardless of what happens though, we sincerely thank him for his efforts over the years and wish himself, Rebecca and their little boy Freddy the very best of luck.
“I’ve known Fergus a long time and his parents and my own parents would have agonised in the stands together as they watched their sons on the pitch, so we wish all of them the very best of luck in the future and hopefully we will continue to keep those connections back to Leinster Rugby strong.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leinster's Fergus McFadden to retire at the end of the season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Fergus McFadden has confirmed that he will retire from rugby at the end of the current season.
Like fellow Ireland internationals Rob Kearney and Devin Toner, McFadden's contract is up this summer but Leinster may still extend the 33-year-old's stay if the club season gets up and running again in the coming months.
“They say the best time to leave a party is when you’re still having fun so the time has come for me to announce my retirement from the end of the season," said McFadden in a statement this afternoon. 
The Kildare man won four European titles with the province, as well as four PRO12/PRO14 titles and made 34 Test appearances for Ireland, with his international debut coming against Italy in the 2011 Six Nations championship.
His final Ireland appearance was off the bench in Paris and contributed as Johnny Sexton won it for the away team with the last kick of the game, the first step towards the Grand Slam in 2018. 
He was also part of the Six Nations winning squad of 2014, and previous to that went to the 2011 World Cup.
"It’s hard to put into words what a privilege it has been to have had such a long career playing for the team I grew up supporting and pulling on a green jersey to play for my country," said McFadden.  "It has been a dream come true.
“So, reflecting on what made this all possible, I would like to thank all the Leinster Rugby staff, Leo Cullen, the wider management team, medics, physios, strength & conditioning coaches, backroom staff and our legendary bagman Johnny O’Hagan. 
"Leinster's incredible success over many years has been as a result of the contributions of the entire team both on and off the field.
“To the players, there are too many for me to name individually right now but all I can say is that it has been an honour to play and work alongside such incredibly talented and professional people. The friendships and memories I have made are ones I will cherish for the rest of my life - not to mention the many laughs we had along the way!
“To the Leinster fans…I don’t think you could ask for better supporters. Your constant support and encouragement was felt throughout - not only there to celebrate the highs but also to support through the lows.
“To my wife Rebecca, my son Freddy, my parents, my friends and family, thanks for being there every step of the way.”  
Leinster head coach Leo Cullen expressed the hope that McFadden would get to say goodbye in the proper fashion.
“We are being guided by public health guidelines at the moment but naturally the hope is that Fergus gets the chance to pull on the Leinster jersey again," Cullen commented.
“Regardless of what happens though, we sincerely thank him for his efforts over the years and wish himself, Rebecca and their little boy Freddy the very best of luck.
“I’ve known Fergus a long time and his parents and my own parents would have agonised in the stands together as they watched their sons on the pitch.
"So we wish all of them the very best of luck in the future and hopefully we will continue to keep those connections back to Leinster Rugby strong.” 
Known for his full commitment and ability to play in the back three and at centre, McFadden played 184 times for Leinster and scored 29 tries - as well as kicking 46 conversions, 68 penalties....and a drop-goal against Cardiff nine years ago. He made his debut at centre in 2007, but was better known as a winger.
Cullen said: “Fergus has been an amazing contributor to lots of great things that have taken place in Leinster and Irish rugby and he’s definitely one of the great characters that we’ve had around in the group.
“The versatility piece that Fergus has is hugely important. It can go against some players and tough calls not going their way but he would always do what’s best for the team. 
"For example, even though typically your ten would take kicks, Fergus had no problem stepping up at crucial moments to take the pressure off someone. He had so many strings to his bow and he’s going to be a great loss to the group.”
Cullen was hugely impressed that, when McFadden was not selected for last year's World Cup, he answered the head coach's call to be a leader for Leinster.
"Fergus came out very high in that process and is still in that leadership group currently," he said.
“That leadership group is based off some questions that we would ask the wider playing group. What do they value? Who lives those values day in, day out? Who do they want in the dressing room sitting beside them?
“You always had a sense for how highly Fergus was regarded amongst his peers and this process just confirmed what we already thought".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bill Beaumont: Six Nations won't be moved</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There could be two consecutive months of international action under plans for a new global tournament, newly re-elected World Rugby chairman Sir Bill Beaumont has revealed. Beaumont is keen to resurrect plans for an annual competition, possibly with promotion and relegation, which were dropped last year, but stressed the Guinness Six Nations would not be expected to change dates or format.

The former England captain’s challenger and former vice-chairman, Agustin Pichot, was the key driver of the Nations Championship idea but Beaumont has promised to carry it on.
Outside the Six Nations and the southern hemisphere’s four-team Rugby Championship, which is due to take place in August and September this year, a 2017 agreement ensures dates in July and November are set aside for internationals.
Sir Bill Beaumont talks to the media:
Beaumont, who has handed a second four-year term on Saturday, said: “I think there could well be an appetite for putting the two windows together. It could be north going south in one month and then immediately afterwards the south would come north the next month.
“But bear in mind we have to take all stakeholders with us. You have to take the club game and European game with us.”
Beaumont revealed “embryonic” talks had begun with representatives from both hemispheres as well as the International Rugby Players union.
“What we will try to do is bring in a new competition that keeps the Six Nations a standalone competition but there could well be an instance that in the Nations Cup, maybe not all the Six Nations teams are playing at the top level,” he said.

“Sitting below that you could have a subsidiary competition featuring emerging nations and you could well have promotion and relegation. We have to find funding that will enable this emerging nations tournament to take place.”
The 68-year-old added: “I do think there’s an appetite from the Six Nations to look at the Nations Cup. Nobody has ever mentioned to me that the Six Nations would move timescale but in my opinion what would move is July and November.
“Why would you move the Six Nations? It is not affecting anyone else’s window on the global calendar. It’s a six-week tournament that has been played in February/March time since I was a lad.”
Beaumont revealed an independent governance review would be chaired by British Olympic Association chairman and former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson, with one of the issues being proposals to alter international eligibility rules.

“It would allow players who might have played in a sevens tournament or might have played an odd game for a tier-one nation, to go back,” he said.
“I just think it gives the opportunity to make some countries who are limited in their player resource.
“You also have to think that the grandparent rule, which applies to a lot of Pacific Island players who might not have been born on the island but look upon themselves as Tongans, Samoans or Fijians. As that runs out then it could well be that they find they are losing players.”
The election exposed a north-south divide with Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Argentina all backing Pichot.
Beaumont said: “Whatever happens in life, not everybody is going to agree with you. The question is to try and reach a consensus. I’d like to think throughout my rugby administration, I have been able to reach a consensus.
“I was once part of the RFU when we were kicked out of the Five Nations and had to go to Glasgow to get us back in and managed to do that.”
Beaumont claimed there was no reason why the coronavirus pandemic should derail plans for a global women’s competition and pledged to put player welfare at the heart of every decision.
He said: “When I look at the size of players nowadays, there is precious little room for smaller, skilful players.
“We still have to have a game that is played in 98 per cent of all the world by people at the weekend, girls and boys, men and women, who want to enjoy the game of rugby. We can’t just make it that it’s the domain for huge players.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Newly re-elected World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont insists Six Nations change is not on his agenda</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Newly re-elected World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont has poured cold water on the idea of the Six Nations shifting to a later date in order to coincide with a global calendar.
There has been some suggestion that the tournament could be moved from its traditional slot in February/March to April/May to allow the Six Nations to be played alongside the Rugby Championship.
However, Beaumont, who saw off Gus Pichot by 28 votes to 23 in the recent election after being supported by each of the Six Nations unions, insisted that there had been no indication from tournament officials that a change of date was on the cards.
“No-one has ever mentioned to me that the Six Nations would move,” Beaumont said.
“What would move, in my opinion, would be the July and November windows. There could be an appetite to put the windows together.
“But why would you move the Six Nations? It is not affecting anyone else’s window on the global calendar. It’s a six-week tournament that’s been played in February and March since I was a lad. It doesn’t affect anywhere else around the globe.”
Beaumont revealed that he intends to look into the idea of introducing a Nations Cup again, but he warned that it would not come at a cost to the Six Nations.
It is hoped that a new tournament could see northern and southern hemisphere teams play home and away fixtures every two years of the World Cup cycle.
While that would be seen as a positive step forward, it seems unlikely that the Six Nations plan to introduce relegation or promotion.
“What we will try and do is bring in a new competition that keeps the Six Nations as a stand alone competition,” Beaumont maintained.
“My own view of the Nations Cup is that maybe after a while not all Six Nations teams are playing in that competition at that top level.
“But the Six Nations is owned, as you know, by the Six Nations and it has been going for 150-odd years and certainly that would not be the intention currently. But who knows?
“There might be an appetite for the Six Nations. I don’t know. There might be. Currently it hasn’t been discussed.”

Rijiju said the coronavirus-forced nationwide lockdown, which has been extended till May 17, forced his ministry to delay the resumption of the training camps at Sports Authority of India (SAI) centres. The lockdown was earlier meant to end on May 3.
“The camps will start in a phase-wise manner. First we will start training in NIS Patiala and SAI, Bengaluru where athletes are based currently...by the end of this month training is expected to start in Bengaluru and Patiala,” Rijiju said at FICCI’s webinar titled ‘Corona & Sports: The Champions Speak’
“The camps will be for those sports which have qualified for Olympics or the sports whose Olympic qualification is in future,” he said...We will relax things partially looking at the Olympics,” he added.
The national camps were suspended in mid-March when the COVID-19 cases began rising in the country.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Plan to resume national camps shut due to COVID-19 from May end: Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Sports Minister Kiren Rijiju on Sunday said his ministry is devising a plan to ensure a phased resumption of national camps for Olympic-bound athletes by the end of this month but others might have to wait till at least September.
Rijiju said the coronavirus-forced nationwide lockdown, which has been extended till May 17, forced his ministry to delay the resumption of the training camps at Sports Authority of India (SAI) centres. The lockdown was earlier meant to end on May 3.
"The camps will start in a phase-wise manner. First we will start training in NIS Patiala and SAI, Bengaluru where athletes are based currently...by the end of this month training is expected to start in Bengaluru and Patiala," Rijiju said at FICCI's webinar titled 'Corona & Sports: The Champions Speak'.

"We will relax things partially looking at the Olympics," he added.
The national camps were suspended in mid-March when the COVID-19 cases began rising in the country.
The pandemic has killed over 1300 people in India while more than 39,000 have tested positive for the deadly infection. Globally, the death toll has crossed 2 lakh.
The Sports Minister said he wanted a resumption of the national camps on Sunday itself but his hands were tied by the extension of the lockdown, which comes under the National Disaster Management Act.
"I thought of starting training of athletes at SAI centres from May 3 but now we will have to do that in a phased manner by the end of this month because sports events don't get any relaxation under the Disaster Management Act.
"We don't fall under essential services," Rijiju said.
Rijiju, however, made it clear athletes of disciplines, which are not in the reckoning for Olympic qualification, will have to wait for a longer duration to start training.
"We will not allow any national camp beyond Olympic-bound athletes or probables. The resumption of such camps (which are not in reckoning for Olympics) may have to wait till September-October this year," he said.
The minister also said that fans will have to wait for a while to see sporting activities on the ground till the pandemic is brought under control.
"Let us not expect any competitive match in near future," Rijiju said.
Rijiju's comments came close on the heels of Indian Olympic Association President Narinder Batra's statement on Saturday that he will ask the government to allow national campers undergo outdoor training inside the country's major sports centres during the lockdown.
The Athletics Federation of India and some athletes at the NIS-Patiala had also written to the Sports Ministry to allow outdoor training.
The Sports Minister said people, including athletes, should expect a lot of changes in their day-to-day life and functioning even after the situation normalises.
"We must accept that things are not going to be as they used to be. We have chalked out certain plans for the future. We are also looking forward to see how India takes up this challenge and emerges as a strong sporting nation post COVID-19," he said.
"Coronavirus is a reality and it is not going to get over soon and so we will have to live with it," he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I cried after Champions League loss to Bayern – Mourinho</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jose Mourinho has revealed how he cried after losing the Champions League to Bayern Munich back in 2012 while he was Real Madrid head coach.
The coach narrated the experience in a recent interview with Spanish outlet MARCA.
The Tottenham head coach said, “Unfortunately, that’s football. Cristiano, Kaka, Sergio Ramos. three complete monsters of football, there’s no doubt about that, but they’re also human.
“That night is the only time in my career as a coach that I’ve cried after a defeat. I remember it well… Aitor [Karanka, Madrid assistant at the time] and I pulled up in front of my house, in the car, crying.
“It was very hard because we were the best that season.”
The German giants advanced to the final of the competition that year after beating Madrid on penalties, with the semi-final tie having gone to extra-time and spot-kicks following a 2-1 win for Mourinho’s men over the 90 minutes, Goal reports.
With the first leg having finished 2-1 to the Bundesliga side, Cristiano Ronaldo struck twice inside 14 minutes at the Bernabeu to put the hosts ahead in the tie.
Arjen Robben struck from the penalty spot after 27 minutes to level things up at 3-3 on aggregate, with Ronaldo, Kaka and Sergio Ramos all missing from 12 yards as the match went to penalties.
Bastian Schweinsteiger was on hand to net the winning spot-kick and set up a meeting with Chelsea in the final, a game that the Blues would win at the Allianz Arena in a match that was again decided by spot-kicks.

Mourinho has managed at some of Europe's biggest clubs over the years after bursting onto scene with FC Porto in the 2003/2004 Champions League season.
Having won the tournament with Porto and Inter Milan, Mourinho was unable to deliver the prestigous trophy during his three seasons with Real Madrid.
The Portuguese tactician has now revealed the semi-final penalty shoot-out loss to Bayern Munich in 2012.
"Unfortunately, that's football. Cristiano, Kaka, Sergio Ramos... three complete monsters of football, there's no doubt about that, but they're also human," he told Marca.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Real Madrid deserved to win Champions League cause we were best, claims ZJose Mourinho</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The current Tottenham Hotspur coach re-collected memories of his stint at the Bernabeu and claimed that Real Madrid deserved to win the Champions League during the three-year period starting 2010. He was swift to point out that the semi-final loss to Bayern Munich in the 2011-12 Champions League was the most heart-breaking for him as a coach. Mourinho recalled how he became emotional and started crying in the car following the defeat.
"That season (2011-12), Real Madrid were the best team in Spain and also the best in Europe, That's why it was so hard for us to deal with going out to Bayern in the Champions League. That night is the only time in my career as a coach that I've cried after a defeat. I remember it well... Aitor [Karanka] and I pulled up in front of my house, in the car, crying...It was very hard because we were the best that season,” said Jose Mourinho, as reported by ESPN. 
“The truth is that team deserved to win La Liga and the Champions League," added the manager.
Even though continental silverware eluded him, the Portuguese did manage to steer Real Madrid to the La Liga title in that same season, which was preceded by a Copa Del Rey triumph in 2010-11. It was although after he parted ways with the club that Real Madrid won their record 10th Champions League trophy in 2014.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mourinho reveals defeat that made him weep - Premium Times Nigeria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jose Mourinho cuts a stern look as a coach but deep down he is also human.
The Portuguese manager who has overseen hundreds of games as coach of different teams including FC Porto, Real Madrid, Chelsea and Manchester United has seen it all.
However, in all of his years in the dugout, Mourinho claims only one defeat has made him cry in his entire managerial career.
Now with Tottenham, Mourinho told Spanish football outlet Marca how he was left devastated after a Champions League semi-final loss to Bayern Munich back in 2012.
The German giants advanced to the final of the competition that year after beating Madrid on penalties, with the semi-final tie having gone to extra-time and spot-kicks following a 2-1 win for Mourinho’s men over the 90 minutes.
The defeat to Bayern was more painful for Mourinho as three of his super reliable players lost begging chances in that explosive encounter.
Looking back at the defeat, Mourinho told Marca: “Unfortunately, that’s football. Cristiano, Kaka, Sergio Ramos… three complete monsters of football, there’s no doubt about that, but they’re also human.
“That night is the only time in my career as a coach that I’ve cried after a defeat. I remember it well… Aitor [Karanka, Madrid assistant at the time] and I pulled up in front of my house, in the car, crying.
“It was very hard because we were the best that season.”
That painful loss proved to be one of few blips in an outstanding season for Madrid, who won the Liga title and earned 100 points, nine more than Barcelona, setting the record for a single top-flight season in Spain.
Mourinho, 57, managed Madrid between 2010 and 2013 and won 128 of his 178 matches in charge of the Spanish club.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football finance expert paints bleak picture for lower league clubs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Football finance expert Kieran Maguire says lower league clubs have been “taken out at the knees” by the coronavirus pandemic, having seen income streams dry up as the possibility of empty stands until 2021 looms large.
Sport, like all industries, is scrambling to get a grip on the Covid-19 crisis, which has led to the decimation of the sporting calendar and pressure increasing on clubs and organisations.
The Premier League is working towards a mid-June return, but there remains plenty of unanswered questions in the EFL as leagues and clubs attempt to navigate through these choppy waters.
There have been countless warnings about clubs going to the wall and League Two side Bradford revealed on Friday they had been informed that there is the “ever-growing possibility of supporters being unable to attend matches until 2021”.
A lack of matchday income for that length of time would irreparably hurt some clubs and Maguire, a lecturer in football finance at the University of Liverpool, paints a bleak overall picture amid this uncertain backdrop.
“The clubs in the lower leagues, most of them have got fairly precarious finances to begin with and have operating on a week-to-week basis in terms of meeting their financial obligations, paying the rent, paying the wage bill, paying the council tax and so on,” he told the PA news agency.
“And that’s during a season when they were having regular fixtures.
“Both Macclesfield and Southend failed to pay wages in February. Oldham didn’t pay their March wages until, I think, two days ago, so there’s a backlog in terms of wages being paid.
“How clubs can address that is beyond me if there is no money coming in through the turnstiles, which accounts for around 40 to 50 per cent of total income for some League One and League Two clubs.
“In terms of the TV deal, I think Sky have been pretty generous to date. But for 2021, they’ve got to have a product before they can pay.
“It’s not fair on them because they’ve got no subscribers themselves. They’ve effectively given everybody a subscription holiday, so their income flows are being impacted.
“Until the EFL have a product which is watchable, then the broadcasters aren’t going to pay for it.
“Matchday income – nothing until we resume. TV – undecided until we’ve got some form of football taking place. And then the third form of income for clubs is sponsors – well, you can’t sponsor a football match which isn’t taking place.
“The industry has been effectively taken out at the knees as a result of the pandemic.”
If the supporter shutout does last the rest of the year, Leyton Orient chief executive Danny Macklin believes income from streaming games could save some EFL clubs.
Clubs currently get 80 per cent of subscriptions to the EFL’s iFollow platform and Maguire believes Sky Sports, UK rights holders, would be flexible enough to negotiate an agreement on that as “they can see the big picture”.
But while that might help plug the gap in League One and Two, already huge losses in the Championship would surely only increase given the current situation.
“The game was living at the edge before the pandemic,” Maguire, the author of ‘The Price of Football’, said.
“If you take a look at the losses in the Championship – there’s a couple of clubs that haven’t published their results, Sheffield Wednesday and Derby – I think we’re looking probably at a cumulative operating loss of around about £650million in the Championship.
“That’s not a sustainable business model unless you have sugar daddies, who are prepared to write out those cheques for £20-30million a year – which to give them credit, most of them have been keen to do for reasons nobody has ever quite managed to fathom out why.
“But if we now move to a situation where there’s no money coming in, those losses of £20-30 million a year in the Championship could easily extend.
“And we will find the sugar daddy owners, they don’t have income in because a lot of them are operating in other industries and there are huge losers, especially in the service sector, in terms of the ability of organisations to make money.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football finance expert paints bleak picture for lower league clubs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The coronavirus pandemic has decimated the sporting calendar.
Football finance expert Kieran Maguire says lower league clubs have been “taken out at the knees” by the coronavirus pandemic, having seen income streams dry up as the possibility of empty stands until 2021 looms large.
Sport, like all industries, is scrambling to get a grip on the Covid-19 crisis, which has led to the decimation of the sporting calendar and pressure increasing on clubs and organisations.
The Premier League is working towards a mid-June return, but there remains plenty of unanswered questions in the EFL as leagues and clubs attempt to navigate through these choppy waters.
There have been countless warnings about clubs going to the wall and League Two side Bradford revealed on Friday they had been informed that there is the “ever-growing possibility of supporters being unable to attend matches until 2021”.
A lack of matchday income for that length of time would irreparably hurt some clubs and Maguire, a lecturer in football finance at the University of Liverpool, paints a bleak overall picture amid this uncertain backdrop.
“The clubs in the lower leagues, most of them have got fairly precarious finances to begin with and have operating on a week-to-week basis in terms of meeting their financial obligations, paying the rent, paying the wage bill, paying the council tax and so on,” he told the PA news agency.
“And that’s during a season when they were having regular fixtures.
“Both Macclesfield and Southend failed to pay wages in February. Oldham didn’t pay their March wages until, I think, two days ago, so there’s a backlog in terms of wages being paid.
“How clubs can address that is beyond me if there is no money coming in through the turnstiles, which accounts for around 40 to 50 per cent of total income for some League One and League Two clubs.
“In terms of the TV deal, I think Sky have been pretty generous to date. But for 2021, they’ve got to have a product before they can pay.
“It’s not fair on them because they’ve got no subscribers themselves. They’ve effectively given everybody a subscription holiday, so their income flows are being impacted.
“Until the EFL have a product which is watchable, then the broadcasters aren’t going to pay for it.
“Matchday income – nothing until we resume. TV – undecided until we’ve got some form of football taking place. And then the third form of income for clubs is sponsors – well, you can’t sponsor a football match which isn’t taking place.
“The industry has been effectively taken out at the knees as a result of the pandemic.”
If the supporter shutout does last the rest of the year, Leyton Orient chief executive Danny Macklin believes income from streaming games could save some EFL clubs.
Clubs currently get 80 per cent of subscriptions to the EFL’s iFollow platform and Maguire believes Sky Sports, UK rights holders, would be flexible enough to negotiate an agreement on that as “they can see the big picture”.
But while that might help plug the gap in League One and Two, already huge losses in the Championship would surely only increase given the current situation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football finance expert in grim 'taken out at the knees' prediction as he paints bleak picture</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Football finance expert Kieran Maguire says lower league club are facing a battle like no other amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Sport, like all industries, is scrambling to get a grip on the Covid-19 crisis, which has led to the decimation of the sporting calendar and pressure increasing on clubs and organisations.
The English Premier League is working towards a mid-June return, but there remains plenty of unanswered questions in the EFL as leagues and clubs attempt to navigate through these choppy waters.
Scottish football moved to fight back but the recriminations that have followed the season-ending vote below the Premiership illustrate how high the stakes are.
There have also been countless warnings about clubs going to the wall down south and League Two side Bradford revealed on Friday they had been informed that there is the "ever-growing possibility of supporters being unable to attend matches until 2021".
A lack of matchday income for that length of time would irreparably hurt some clubs and Maguire, a lecturer in football finance at the University of Liverpool, paints a bleak overall picture amid this uncertain backdrop.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus wrap: World Rugby struggling to plan for sport’s return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">World Rugby chairman Sir Bill Beaumont admits planning the return of international competition is difficult with countries experiencing varying stages of the coronavirus pandemic and holding different strategies.
The summer tour season in July looks set to be wiped out and the Scottish Rugby Union recently admitted there was “developing uncertainty” over the fate of their November Test schedule at BT Murrayfield.
The Guinness Six Nations is unfinished while the southern hemisphere’s Rugby Championship is due to take place in August and September, but the fate of domestic leagues and European competitions is also uncertain.
Beaumont pledged to get straight to work on dealing with the coronavirus crisis after being re-elected for a second four-year term but he added: “We don’t know when we are going to come out of it. Some countries are coming out of it quicker than others.
“We still have to plan the international games, the domestic games, and already you can see there is difference of opinions from country to country whereby last week the French government said there would be no sport played at all until September 1, and in the UK there is still a desire to get some club games started before then.
“So you can imagine what that is like for us when we are trying to put international matches together.
“Everything at the moment is scenario planning: what if, what if, what if.
“You don’t know if there’s going to be any inter-hemisphere travel at all this year. You don’t know whether you can start behind closed doors, we don’t know when that will be. That will vary from country to country.
“It’s extremely difficult to put a marker down and say we will start now and conclude competitions.”
As Beaumont alluded, the UK Government has held talks with sporting bodies such as the Premier League in a bid to get sport back up and running as soon as it is deemed safe to do so. A best-case scenario date of June 8 is understood to have been earmarked for England’s top-flight football to return at neutral venues.
Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish made the case for football’s swift return if deemed appropriate, arguing it would boost the nation’s finances and mental health, plus help define new ways of working for other industries.
Parish wrote in the Sunday Times: “I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the ‘new normal’ might look for a lot of working environments.
“Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis. In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. Football is meaningless – but it is magnificently meaningless. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus latest: World Rugby admits difficulties over planning restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The summer tour season in July looks set to be wiped out and the Scottish Rugby Union recently admitted there was "developing uncertainty" over the fate of their November Test schedule at BT Murrayfield.
The Guinness Six Nations is unfinished while the southern hemisphere's Rugby Championship is due to take place in August and September, but the fate of domestic leagues and European competitions is also uncertain.
Beaumont pledged to get straight to work on dealing with the coronavirus crisis after being re-elected for a second four-year term but he added: "We don't know when we are going to come out of it. Some countries are coming out of it quicker than others.
"We still have to plan the international games, the domestic games, and already you can see there is difference of opinions from country to country whereby last week the French government said there would be no sport played at all until September 1, and in the UK there is still a desire to get some club games started before then.
"So you can imagine what that is like for us when we are trying to put international matches together.
"Everything at the moment is scenario planning: what if, what if, what if.
"You don't know if there's going to be any inter-hemisphere travel at all this year. You don't know whether you can start behind closed doors, we don't know when that will be. That will vary from country to country.
"It's extremely difficult to put a marker down and say we will start now and conclude competitions."
As Beaumont alluded, the UK Government has held talks with sporting bodies such as the Premier League in a bid to get sport back up and running as soon as it is deemed safe to do so. A best-case scenario date of June 8 is understood to have been earmarked for England's top-flight football to return at neutral venues.
Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish made the case for football's swift return if deemed appropriate, arguing it would boost the nation's finances and mental health, plus help define new ways of working for other industries.
Parish wrote in the Sunday Times: "I believe that just as Formula One is often the precursor to developments that become standard in general road vehicles, so Premier League football with its physical science, medical infrastructures and resources for looking after its people, can begin to define how the 'new normal' might look for a lot of working environments.
"Not only that, in our country and beyond, people need to find ways to move forward mentally, to experience some small relief from the worries of this crisis. In my view a story here and a conversation there about the game last night will not trivialise loss or suffering but offer a tiny respite from it for many people. Football is meaningless – but it is magnificently meaningless. It has the power to lighten lives; why not see if we can use that power again?"

    <h5 class="mb-1">William Byron scores 3rd iRacing victory of NASCAR’s series</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CHARLOTTE, N.C. — William Byron showed he’s the sharpest gamer in NASCAR’s iRacing Series with his third victory in four events.
Byron passed Timmy Hill with seven laps remaining at virtual Dover International Speedway, where NASCAR was scheduled to actually race Sunday, to win yet again on the iRacing platform. The Hendrick Motorsports driver has consistently been the best of the NASCAR professionals in simulated racing.
Alex Bowman won last week at virtual Talladega Superspeedway, so Hendrick drivers have now won four consecutive iRacing events.
“I’ve enjoyed this iRacing Series, but I’m definitely ready to get going in my real car,” Byron said. “Racing anything, whether it’s a box car or anything with an engine, is going to give you confidence if you are winning.”
He said that in all his years using iRacing, he’s never been in such competitive events since NASCAR launched the invitational esports series after the stock car series was suspended March 13.
Denny Hamlin earned the pole in qualifying, but NASCAR successfully applied an invert — a glitch last week prevented the top 10 from flipping before the race began — so Ross Chastain cycled into the top starting spot.
Hamlin had his race ruined last week when his daughter accidentally turned his simulator screen off with a remote control she was holding as he was competing. He made sure to hide all remotes before Sunday’s race, but after an incident with John Hunter Nemechek, he seemed to be deliberately wrecked by Nemechek later in retaliation.
It brought out a late caution and a restart with nine laps remaining and Hill leading Byron at the green flag.
Byron didn’t need to use a bump-and-run — the move Hill used on Byron to win the virtual race at Texas Motor Speedway — and easily passed him on the inside with seven laps remaining.
Hill finished second and was shown at times racing with his cat on his steering wheel.
“William has done a great job through this iRacing invitational,” Hill said. “I just wish I could get another win. I’ve had such tremendous support from everyone in the racing community through this; this has been a blast and really brought us all together. We’ve really had a lot of fun racing all these races, but I can’t wait to get back and see everyone’s faces.”
NASCAR will complete its iRacing Series next Saturday at North Carolina’s deserted North Wilkesboro Speedway, a track last raced by the national series in 1996. Overgrown with weeds and clearly neglected, Dale Earnhardt Jr. last year led a group of volunteers in cleaning the speedway so it could be mapped for use in iRacing.
Although the simulated version of North Wilkesboro is not yet available to the public on the iRacing platform, it will be the virtual host for NASCAR’s finale. Then it’s back to the real thing for the stock car series, which plans to resume competition without spectators starting May 17 at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina.

The appointment has been announced within 24 hours of Sir Bill Beaumont being re-elected as World Rugby chairman.
Former Conservative MP Robertson was previously sports minister during the London Olympic Games.
Beaumont said in a virtual media conference: “I am fully committed to undertaking a wide-changing governance review and I am quite happy to announce that Sir Hugh Robertson will chair that governance committee.”
The former England captain pledged to revisit plans for an annual global international competition, which were dropped last year and were heavily backed by his challenger and former vice-chairman Agustin Pichot.
Beaumont said: “We will also be looking at the global season, maybe looking again at a variation of the Nations Championship, that was one of the big regrets that I wasn’t able to put away. But we have learned from that experience.
“Out of that, we need to take more heed of the players. I am committed to getting the players involved in any decision that we make.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">World Rugby governance review to be led by BOA chairman Sir Hugh Robertson</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British Olympic Association chairman Sir Hugh Robertson has been selected to lead an independent governance review of World Rugby.
The appointment has been announced within 24 hours of Sir Bill Beaumont being re-elected as World Rugby chairman.
Former Conservative MP Robertson was previously sports minister during the London Olympic Games.
Beaumont said in a virtual media conference: “I am fully committed to undertaking a wide-changing governance review and I am quite happy to announce that Sir Hugh Robertson will chair that governance committee.”
Beaumont said: “We will also be looking at the global season, maybe looking again at a variation of the Nations Championship, that was one of the big regrets that I wasn’t able to put away. But we have learned from that experience.
“Out of that, we need to take more heed of the players. I am committed to getting the players involved in any decision that we make.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">For every Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry, snooker also boasted its bit-part players: the what-might-have-beens and never-minds, who left their own small but indelible mark upon the sport.
For the duration of the postponed World Championships, the PA news agency is turning its focus on the Crucible characters who never quite made the competition’s last three days.
Sporting a reasonable haircut and an average shot-time, John Virgo could well have become the snooker champion time forgot.
As it turns out, Virgo had more cause for fear than most: his biggest triumph, overTerry Griffiths to win the UK Championship in 1979, was not recorded due to the BBC cameramen being on strike.
Virgo came of age in the game when it was still very much a closed shop, making a strong first impression by reaching the semi-finals of the 1977 UK Championships, where he lost to Patsy Fagan.
Two years later, along with his UK win, Virgo reached the World Championship semi-finals, but he would never get beyond the second round in 12 subsequent appearances, winning just four matches in that time.
Nevertheless, Virgo evolved into an unlikely household name, first through the series of impressions he would be called upon to reel off when the Crucible schedule ran short.
And his post-playing career truly rocketed when he became the sidekick of rumbustious comedian Jim Davidson on the popular BBC quiz show ‘Big Break’ throughout the 1990s.
Moreover, Virgo has endured as one of the sport’s most popular commentators, despite a 2016 gaffe in which he was forced to apologise after swearing on air, believing his microphone to be turned off.
Now 74, Virgo’s cries of ‘Where’s the cue ball going?” have become every bit an integral part of the Crucible furniture as those players who have the talent and fortune to be still standing at the end of 17 days.

Heta began his work at 3am with a dismissive 5-0 thrashing of new tour card holder Gary Blades.
Heta hit three 180s and averaged 96, adding afterwards: “On my day I feel like I am unbeatable. I do see myself up there with the best.”
The 32-year-old ‘Heat’ continued his good form with a 5-3 victory over world number 31 John Henderson, sealed with a 121 finish on the bullseye, and needed only three legs in his final outing to progress on leg difference.
He went on to lose 5-3 to Krzysztof Kciuk, taking part in Krakow, missing out on a clean sweep.
“I’m happy I got the win, more or less, but I’d love to win three that’s for sure,” Heta said.
Henderson ended the night by heaping more disappointment on the struggling Blades, winning 5-1 to take second place ahead of Kciuk.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Deciding on a return to action is down to the individual, says Jason Roy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">World Cup winner Jason Roy accepts his role as “a pawn” in debates around when and where cricket should return but believes all players should be free to make their own decisions.
The start of the English season has been pushed back until July 1 at the earliest as a result of the ongoing battle against coronavirus, with the potential for further delays if the situation does not improve.
The England and Wales Cricket Board is nevertheless plotting how matches could be staged as and when it gets a governmental green light to proceed, including the possibility of action behind closed doors in ‘bio-secure’ environments.
The Daily Telegraph reports that England could begin their three-Test series against the West Indies on July 8 with an ECB spokesman confirming “discussions with Cricket West Indies continued on Friday”.
“I think I’ll do what I’m told by bosses. I’m just a pawn in the sporting world,” said Roy, who has played 127 times for his country across all three formats.
“I won’t be going to my bosses and saying ‘put me in the front line’, I’ll just get told what to do. I’ve got a huge amount of trust in the ECB and I think they will look into every single avenue – all the positives, all the negatives.
“So I guess I would trust in what they say, probably have a chat with Morgs (limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan), see where his head’s at and kind of go with that really.
“If an individual wants to go on to the front line and put himself at risk, then good on him. But if somebody doesn’t want to, then I don’t think they should be criticised.”
England is not alone in wondering when it will be able to host elite sport again, with question marks also growing over this year’s Twenty20 World Cup in Australia.
The tournament – which offers the likes of Roy a unique opportunity to become double world champions following England’s famous win in the 50-over competition last summer – is scheduled for October, but at present the idea of 16 teams converging in one place seems a potential health risk.
“If players aren’t able to prepare in the right way and are not able to get over to Australia, then it makes sense to postpone it. But if it goes ahead, it’s our job to play cricket.
“If we’re told we have three weeks to prepare to go and play in the World T20, all the boys will be putting the yards in to make sure we’re ready for that. We’ll get in the nets and go hit some balls.”
Quite what those first few net sessions will look like is anybody’s guess, with the hiatus already into its second month and muscle memory getting a long unscheduled break.
“I’ve never really had a lay-off like this. I’ve had injuries before but even then I’m still hitting balls, whether it is underarm or stuff like that,” said Roy.
“I’m just shadow-batting in the mirror – I’m looking pretty good – or hitting a tennis ball against the wall here at home. It will be interesting to see how quickly it turns around. I’ve got a feeling a 70mph bowler will be feeling a little bit faster so I think we’re going to have to ramp up the training pretty quickly.”
Roy also reflected on his brief stint in Test cricket, which came straight off the back of his World Cup heroics but ended after just five caps following a difficult Ashes series.
Rory Burns, Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley are all now ahead in the pecking order as openers but a second chance in the middle order has crossed Roy’s mind.
“There’s no doubt in my mind that I’m going to be trying my hardest to get back into the side.
“Scoring the weight of runs in white ball cricket and then not being able to do that in Test cricket was upsetting for me, because I really felt like I could.
“I still feel like I can but I just need to fight for my position again, get back in there and prove to myself that I can actually do it.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘World Test Championship points system is ridiculous’, says Michael Holding</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">West Indies fast bowling great Michael Holding has termed the World Test Championship’s points system as “ridiculous”, where some of the Tests will be rendered inconsequential once teams realise that they can’t finish in top two in the points table.
As per the current points system, the value for each Test match win in a two-match series is 60 points a game.
However, if it’s a five-match series, the value of a Test match win is reduced to 24. So basically, a team can gain up to 120 points from a series, regardless of the number of matches. The top two qualify for the final.
The Test Championship, which is scheduled to finish with a final at Lord’s in June 2021, was introduced by the ICC last year in a bid to revive bilateral Test cricket.
“It doesn’t work,” Holding told Wisden Cricket Monthly during a round table when asked if the Test championship was achieving what it was designed for.
“First of all, the points system is ridiculous. You can’t play five Test matches and get the same amount of points if you play two Test matches.
“And secondly, at some point you’re going to have teams who know they cannot get to the final and so those Test matches aren’t going to be all that entertaining. People know it’s just another game.”
England fast bowler Chris Woakes, who was also part of the round table, said the points system might need to be tweaked in future.
“The New Zealand series (England lost 1-0 away to the Black Caps last winter) wasn’t part of the World Test Championship but that defeat didn’t affect us any less as players,” Woakes said.
“I think the system might need a bit of tinkering with in the future. Anyone can turn someone over in a one-off final, depending on the toss or conditions. If there was more time in the calendar they could do a three-match final but unfortunately there just isn’t,” he said.
India are currently leading the World Test Championship which has been thrown out of gear due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which saw the postponement of a number of series.
In February this year, New Zealand captain Kane Williamson had said there are elements of the points system used for the World Test Championship which are “unfair”.

    <h5 class="mb-1">World Test Championship's points system is ridiculous: Holding</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: West Indies fast bowling great Michael Holding has termed the World Test Championship's points system as "ridiculous", where some of the Tests will be rendered inconsequential once teams realise that they can't finish in top two in the points table.
As per the current points system, the value for each Test match win in a two-match series is 60 points a game. However, if it's a five-match series, the value of a Test match win is reduced to 24. So basically, a team can gain up to 120 points from a series, regardless of the number of matches.
The top two then qualify for the final.
The Test Championship, which is scheduled to finish with a final at Lord's in June 2021, was introduced by the ICC last year in a bid to revive bilateral Test cricket.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Ridiculous’: West Indies legend Michael Holding not pleased with World Test Championship format</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">West Indies fast bowling great Michael Holding has termed the World Test Championship’s points system as “ridiculous”, where some of the Tests will be rendered inconsequential once teams realise that they can’t finish in top two in the points table.
As per the current points system, teams will play for 120 points from a series, equally divided by the number of matches as agreed upon by the boards. So, the value for each Test match win in a two-match series is 60 points a game. If it’s a five-match series, the value of a Test match win is reduced to 24. The number of matches played by each team over the duration of the championship is not uniform either.
The top two teams in the final standings then qualify for the final.
The Test Championship, which is scheduled to finish with a final at Lord’s in June 2021, was introduced by the ICC last year in a bid to revive bilateral Test cricket.
“It doesn’t work,” Holding told Wisden Cricket Monthly during a round-table when asked if the Test championship was achieving what it was designed for.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Michael Holding explains why World Test Championship points system is ‘ridiculous’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former West Indies seamer Michael Holding has deemed the World Test Championship’s points system as “ridiculous” and stated that it doesn’t work in the long run.
The Test Championship was launched by the ICC in 2019 to make bilateral Test series more meaningful. It culminates with a final at Lord’s next June between the two teams who remain at the top of the points table.
However, according to Holding this system is not the answer to make Test cricket more interesting and relevant.
“It doesn’t work,” Holding told the Wisden Cricket Monthly.
“First of all the points system is ridiculous. You can’t play five Test matches and get the same amount of points if you play two Test matches,” he explained.
“And secondly, at some point you’re going to have teams who know they cannot get to the final and so those Test matches aren’t going to be all that entertaining. People know it’s just another game,” he added.
England seamer Chris Woakes who was also a part of the discussion shared his thoughts and said: “The New Zealand series [England lost 1-0 away to the Black Caps last winter] wasn’t part of the World Test Championship but that defeat didn’t affect us any less as players.”
“I think the system might need a bit of tinkering with in the future. Anyone can turn someone over in a one-off final, depending on the toss or conditions. If there was more time in the calendar they could do a three-match final but unfortunately there just isn’t.”
Holding’s tryst with ICC
A well-known commentator for three decades, Holding, has lashed out at the International Cricket Council (ICC) on previous occasions as well.
In 2019, when the ICC asked commentators to restrain themselves and avoid pointing out the errors of umpires on air during the ongoing World Cup, he said: “If those umpires yesterday were FIFA officials, they would have been told to pack their bags and head home.”
“They would not have been given another World Cup game to officiate. As a former cricketer, I think cricket should be held to a higher standard. Is the objective to protect the umpires even when they do a bad job?”
“I am sorry, but I am not going to be part of that. Please let me know if I should be heading back to my home in Newmarket instead of heading to Cardiff because I don’t agree with what is being suggested here and happy not being part of it,” he had further added:

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">British national champion Alice Barnes expected to spend this weekend racing at the Tour de Yorkshire but instead is preparing for a very different challenge when Zwift’s Tour for All launches on Monday.
For the next five days, riders from a number of professional men’s and women’s teams will compete in online races as part of a month-long charity fundraising initiative open to the public on Zwift’s virtual platform.
Line-ups will change daily as teams rotate their riders, but British duo Adam and Simon Yates are in Mitchelton-Scott’s squad for the event, while Barnes can expect to face former world champions Marianne Vos (CCC Liv) and Anna Van Der Breggen (Boels Dolmans) in the women’s event.
Zwift will donate 125,000 US dollars (£100,000) to Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres throughout the event, a sum which will be doubled if 250,000 people complete a stage.
For Canyon-SRAM rider Barnes, the race offers some welcome competition as she awaits the UCI’s planned announcement on Tuesday on when WorldTour racing might be able to resume.
“Zwift races are really important not only to maintain some focus and racing intensity but also for exposure for the team,” Barnes told the PA news agency.
“I would love to be racing and I am missing the adrenaline of being in the bunch but I am grateful for my situation.
“I think at the moment there are a lot worse problems in the world than our sport. We will have to wait for when the time is right to get racing again and make sure that we are ready for it.”
The racing will be broadcast live via the Global Cycling Network and Eurosport, with the women’s races taking place ahead of the men’s.
Monday’s opening stage will be a 52.9km test on a virtual edition of the Innsbruck circuit used in the 2018 Road World Championships – which is when Van Der Breggen claimed the rainbow stripes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Own goals during the coronavirus lockdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rojo has become the latest Premier League player to break coronavirus lockdown rules.
It is the latest in a string of own goals in the sport since the pandemic started.
Here, the PA news agency looks at the high-profile ones.
Police were called to the Dickens Heath area of Solihull to reports that a Range Rover had crashed into two parked cars, with pictures emerging online of the Aston Villa midfielder in slippers and a bright blue hoodie. Grealish later said he was “deeply embarrassed” after he “stupidly agreed” to go to a friend’s house – less than a day after launching a video appeal for people to stay at home during the Government-enforced lockdown.
The Manchester City and England full-back said sorry after it was widely reported he held a party at his home, with the threat of disciplinary action following as his club promised an “internal disciplinary procedure”. Like Grealish, he had earlier urged the public to follow the Government advice.
Tottenham’s players were spotted flouting social distancing rules as Jose Mourinho was seen working in a Barnet park with Tanguy Ndombele. Davinson Sanchez and Ryan Sessegnon were also caught by a social media user running side by side around the same park and Serge Aurier also posted a video of himself on Instagram jogging alongside another person. The club, who also reversed their decision to furlough staff following a backlash, underlined the Government’s Covid-19 regulations to their players. But little over a fortnight later, Aurier was at it again, posting a video on his Instagram Story of him training with team-mate Moussa Sissoko before deleting it.
Liverpool did the same as Spurs. The Premier League leaders, who in February announced pre-tax profits of £42million for 2018-19, furloughed some non-playing staff before performing a U-turn on the decision, with chief executive Peter Moore admitting they came to the “wrong conclusion”. Bournemouth also followed suit.
Arsenal were forced to speak to David Luiz, Alexandre Lacazette, Nicolas Pepe and Granit Xhaka after they were pictured flouting Government guidelines on social distancing. Luiz and Xhaka were seen meeting up in a park in north London, a video emerged of Pepe playing football with his friends, while Lacazette was pictured getting too close to a man valeting his car on his drive.
Everton labelled Kean’s actions “unacceptable” after he filmed himself partying at home with guests in a breach of social distancing regulations. The Toffees said in a statement: “Everton Football Club was appalled to learn of an incident in which a first-team player ignored Government guidance and club policy in relation to the coronavirus crisis. The club has strongly expressed its disappointment to the player and made it clear that such actions are completely unacceptable.”
The PA news agency understands Manchester United will remind Marcos Rojo of his responsibilities after the defender was filmed appearing to flout Argentina’s lockdown rules. The 30-year-old, on loan at Estudiantes, was seen playing cards and smoking with friends in his homeland, where president Alberto Fernandez recently extended lockdown until May 10.

    <h5 class="mb-1">No sparring in the time of lockdown for boxers till guidelines on safety in place</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There is still some time before training resumes at national camps but even when it does, boxers will not engage in any sparring till clear guidelines are in place to ensure their safety in a world scarred by the COVID-19pandemic.
Six-time world champion M C Mary Kom has made it clear that she won’t recommend sparring at a time when even a touch of the hand is being seen as potentially infection-causing.
“For the time being, I don’t see any sparring happening in training at least, I would be totally against it. I believe training itself will become very individualistic,” she told PTI in a recent interaction.
Sports minister Kiren Rijiju, following an online interaction with the Boxing Federation of India President Ajay Singh and the boxers, including Mary Kom, on Sunday said all necessary precautions will be put in place before sparring can commence again.
“We will have to discuss with technical officials, high-performance directors, and most importantly health professionals to assess the precautions we have to put in place before our athletes begin practising with their sparring partners,” he said.
“We have to do thorough medical check-ups, put the partners in quarantine if needed before training can begin,” he added.
The minister, earlier in the day, said national camps, shut since mid-March due to the coronavirus-forced lockdown, will restart in a phased manner by the end of this month at least for Olympic-bound athletes.
Indian Boxing’s High-Performance Director Santiago Nieva told PTI that camps, when they resume, will not have sparring sessions unless clear instructions are provided on the protocol to follow.
“There will not be any sparring without a protocol in place,” he said.
“In my opinion, in a closed environment, from which nobody goes out after checking in, sparring can take place. We just have to ensure that the selected group is isolated from others,” he added.
The deadly infection, which has changed the world in a matter of months, has caused over 2 lakh deaths across the globe.
In India, the death toll has crossed 1300 and more than 39,000 have been infected by the virus which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in November last year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Credit for Rohit Sharma's success goes to MS Dhoni: Gautam Gambhir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir believes the credit for Rohit Sharma's meteoric rise in white-ball cricket must be given to former captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni.
Since making his debut in 2007, Rohit was languishing in the middle-order with consistency being his main issue.
Dhoni seemingly took note of Rohit's hidden talent and gave him a long rope. He then promoted Rohit as opener in 2013 and that move worked wonders for him as the right-hander has gone on to become one of the most lethal top-order batsmen in white-ball cricket.
"Where Rohit Sharma is today, it is because of M.S. Dhoni," Gambhir told Sports Tak.

"You can talk about the selection committee and team management, but if you do not have the backing from your captain then it is all useless. Everything is in the hands of the captain.
"How Dhoni backed Rohit Sharma over a period of time, I don't think any other player has been given such support," he added.
Earlier, Gambhir had described Rohit as the best white-ball cricketer in the world. In his birthday wish for Rohit, Gambhir wrote: "Happy Birthday to the best white-ball cricketer in the world Rohit Sharma! Have a great year ahead!!"
"Don't know about that Gauti bhai. But loving your work," Rohit responded to the high praise from his former teammate.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Told Rohit Sharma he will rule Indian cricket, good on MS Dhoni that he backed him: Gautam Gambhir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In 2012, on India’s tour of Sri Lanka, a certain middle order batsman made 13 runs in five outings for the visitors. That sort of return is enough to end careers, if one is not fortunate or talented enough. But Rohit Sharma certainly had the talent and, perhaps more importantly, had the backing of his captain MS Dhoni after a tour like that.
Not long after, he turned his career around. Today, he is one of the game’s best white-ball openers and is potentially heading towards all-time-great status when it comes to top-order batsmen in the 50-over format.
That evolution of Rohit happened because of his talent and Dhoni’s trust, said former Indian opener Gautam Gambhir.
“I remember Rohit had a miserable Sri Lanka tour,” Gambhir told anchor Jatin Sapru on Star Sports’ ‘Cricket Connected’ show. “When we returned I Whatsapp’d him (probably the first time I did that to anyone), saying that he is going to rule Indian cricket. I knew he had the talent and good on MS Dhoni that he backed him. You have to give a lot of credit to Dhoni for the evolution of Rohit and for making him open the batting. Not a lot of players have been backed the way Rohit has been.”
Watch: When Dhoni surprised Rohit by asking him to open at CT 2013
A large part of Rohit’s turnaround has been his success an opener in ODIs. Even though he had opened a few times in 2011, the experiment started properly in 2013 when the Mumbaikar was making a comeback to the Indian side.
“I remember the first time Rohit opened the batting (when he was making a comeback in 2013) was with me in Mohali against England. He made a half century then and since he then he hasn’t looked back,” Gambhir said.
Dhoni’s gamble with trusting Rohit as an opening batsman is now legendary.
“We felt he was bit of a waste of talent if he was batting at No 6 for us because more often than not he wasn’t getting enough chance to bat as our top-order was quite fixed. We couldn’t really make him play or give him enough opportunities,” Dhoni had said once.
Pause, rewind, play: Watch Rohit Sharma’s three double centuries in ODIs
In fact, 2013 was the watershed year for Sharma. It saw his career take a permanent upswing. His promotion triggered a dramatic turn in fortunes. He went on to play a key role in India’s Champions Trophy triumph in England, scored an ODI double-century against Australia, and guided Mumbai Indians to their first IPL title after being handed captaincy.
The arcs of Virat and Rohit’s wildly contrasting ODI careers
Responding to a question about how Rohit’s success as an opener shows that the criticism that comes his way sometimes regarding his fitness is unfair, Gambhir played down the need for six packs for someone to be a good batsman.
“You don’t need to be a fitness freak, you don’t have to have chiselled bodies and six packs, that is no criteria for being a successful international cricketer. If you are match-fit, you know you can bat for 50 overs, you can bat in the Sri Lankan heat and bat an entire day in Test cricket, that is all you want from a batsman. And he is a brilliant fielder too, very under-rated,” Gambhir added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MS Dhoni the person behind Rohit Sharma's success, asserts Gautam Gambhir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Much like his innings construction in ODI cricket, Rohit Sharma's career is also a collision of two contrasting halves. He averaged 30.84 in ODI cricket from 2007 to 2012 but the next seven years have been a different journey, in which he has averaged a stunning 59.47. Three double centuries are a testament to the amazing transformation. 
But all of that goes back to MS Dhoni’s decision of promoting him to the opening slot ahead of the 2013 Champions Trophy. Gautam Gambhir, who recently labelled Rohit as the best white-ball player in the world at the moment, stated that the credit goes to MS Dhoni for having trust in the latter’s abilities.
"Where Rohit Sharma is today, it is because of M.S. Dhoni. You can talk about the selection committee and team management, but if you do not have the backing from your captain then it is all useless. Everything is in the hands of the captain," Gambhir said in Star Sports' Cricket Connected.
"How Dhoni backed Rohit Sharma over a period of time, I don't think any other player has been given such support," he added.
Rohit currently has 9115 runs to his name with a fantastic average of 49.27 in the 50-over format for India while his five centuries in the 2019 World Cup awarded him with the ICC ODI Player of the Year 2019.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘It is because of...’: Gautam Gambhir believes credit for Rohit Sharma’s success should go to former captain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rohit Sharma has had a phenomenal cricket career till now. He has a record-maker in limited-overs cricket with three double hundreds while scoring six tons at the 2019 Cricket World Cup. Rohit is the vice-captain of the limited-overs side and is as integral to the Indian team as skipper Virat Kohli. However, things weren’t as smooth for Rohit at the start of his international career. Rohit was often criticised for his inability to make big scores and for also being given a lot of chances despite not performing well.
But a lot changed after the 2011 World Cup for Rohit. He was brought back into the side after being dropped and after being given a chance to open the innings, Rohit hasn’t looked back.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma should groom youngsters like MS Dhoni groomed them: Gautam Gambhir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After established himself among one of the greatest in the white-ball cricket, Rohit Sharma also proved his mettle in the longest format of the game after being promoted as an opener. Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir also believes the 33-year-old is among the greatest in limited-overs in the present time and feels MS Dhoni is the man who should be given credit for Rohit's successful cricket career.
Rohit made his debut for India in 2007, but it was only after MS Dhoni promoted him as an opener in 2013 that his career turned around. Today Rohit Sharma is the only player to have hit 3 ODI double hundreds and five World Cup centuries and that is all because he once had strong backing from Dhoni, Gambhir believes.
"Where Rohit Sharma is today, it is because of MS Dhoni," Gambhir told Sports Tak.
"You can talk about the selection committee and team management, but if you do not have the backing from your captain than it is all useless. Everything is in the hands of the captain. How MS Dhoni had backed Rohit Sharma over a period of time, I do not think any player has been given such support."
The 2011 World Cup-winning member also said that Rohit Sharma is the prime example of how a player's fortunes can turn around if he is nurtured by the seniors.
"I hope the young cricketers in the current generation today, be it Shubman Gillm Sanju Samson, they also get similar kind of support. And now when Rohit is a senior, I expect him to give backing to youngsters. Rohit is a prime example of how a player can become a phenomenal cricketer, if he has good backing. One good thing about MS was that he always kept Rohit in the talks, even if was not part of the team, he was always part of the group. He never let him get sidelined."
"I expect Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to groom the youngsters in the same way in which MS Dhoni groomed them."
Rohit Sharma greatest white-ball cricketer in current generation
When Rohit Sharma turned 33 a couple of days back, Gambhir had wished the Mumbai batsman, calling him the greatest white-ball cricketer in the world right now.
Gambhir once again reiterated his thoughts and said no other player has an impact like Rohit Sharma does and thus there is no one like him in the present time.
"I think he is the best white-ball cricketer in the world right now. He is not the greatest overall but at the moment he is the best. He is the only player to have hit 3 ODI double hundreds, 5 World Cup hundreds and he is also the only player, who once gets past 100-run mark, people say that he missed a double century."
"He had hit 5 World Cup hundred in England. People cannot do that in their entire careers. 3 ODI double hundreds, players do not have 3 double hundreds in Tests. There are many who could score runs, but for me white-ball cricket is all about impact. Virat Kohli will end up getting many more runs than Rohit Sharma, and Kohli is among the greatest right now, but Rohit has an edge over Kohli because of the impact he has."
"It is very difficult to compare both of them. Virat Kohli is unbelievable. His stats prove that. But when your reputation is such that when you get out after a hundred, people say he has missed out on double hundred, that speaks volumes about you."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With all sporting events cancelled around the world due to the ongoing pandemic, Sunil Chhetri decided to help out a fan when he requested the Indian football team captain for his Netflix ID and password. The fan even suggested to the football star that he could change the password after the lockdown.
Taking to Twitter, the 35-year-old player shared a screenshot of a message he received from a fan along with a caption that read, “Jerseys. Autograph on picture X. Reply to the post X. Video wishing the neighbour’s son’s pet dog X. Here’s someone who has priorities straight and it’s really making me want to consider the demand.”
With a following of over one million, it did not take long for Chhetri’s post to go viral, prompting reactions from many, including Netflix India.
The exchange between the two soon resulted in the fan not only getting a signed Jersey from Chhetri but also a free Netflix subscription.
“How about we send him both the jersey and a subscription card? Let’s make his day. Slide tackling into your DMs so we can figure out how to do this,” read the final tweet from Netflix to Chhetri.
The exchange between the two soon went viral, triggering several reactions among followers. However, the end result also left many jealous.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fan asks India captain Sunil Chhetri for his Netflix password, gets free two-month subscription</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Indian football team captain Sunil Chhetri is used to getting surrounded by fans for an autograph or a selfie or both. Perhaps that has been replaced by a reply to a post or a mention in his feed during the nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.
But for Chhetri, the fans’ requests don’t quite stop. With the lockdown now in place for over a month, fans are calling on the star for more than just memorabilia.
A fan recently requested the Indian football captain to share the user ID and password of his Netflix account during the lockdown period so that he could have much-needed entertainment,
Chhetri was amused and shared a screengrab of the message, suggesting he’s willing to consider this unusual request.
Netflix India replied to Chhetri, cheekily asking for an autograph on his picture, now that it’s been brought up with the Indian captain. The Indian captain agreed to it, on one condition – offering to send a signed shirt if Netflix gave the fan a free two-month subscription.
Netflix India then agreed to grant Chhetri’s request while adding that they could also send him the signed shirt.
Chhetri then confirmed that the fan would be getting a two-month free Netflix subscription, along with signed jersey. As part of the deal, the Indian captain would also send another signed jersey to Netflix India.
The lockdown period enforced due to the coronavirus pandemic is a hard time for everyone and such gestures surely help.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: With sporting events across the globe either being cancelled or suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic, sportspersons have been locked indoors and are spending time not just with family but also by interacting with fans and India's football team captain Sunil Chhetri received a message from a fan who wanted his Netflix ID and password.
Taking to Twitter, Chhetri posted the screenshot of the message he got on Facebook and wrote: "Jersey X Autograph on a picture X Reply to the post X Video wishing the neighbour's son's pet dog X
Here's someone who has priorities straight and it's really making me want to consider the demand."

Tennis star Sania Mirza had a good laugh on Twitter after seeing his post.
Earlier, in a series of tweets, Chhetri had announced that the members of the Indian team had come together and "put on table a sum that has been sent to the PM-Cares Fund" to help in the fight against coronavirus.
Chhetri added that the reason why he was mentioning this on Twitter was so that others who have the capacity to make donations are inspired to do so.
"We've always received more than we can give. Which is why in this time of need, all of us national team players have come together and put on the table a sum that has been sent to the PM-Cares Fund to help India's fight with the pandemic," said Chhetri in a series of tweets.
"It's been heartening to see everyone -- cutting across caps, goals, age and experience -- give, and give with a smile. When word got out, even some who have long stopped pulling on an India shirt, turned up and asked to be counted. That's what a team is all about. The ONLY reason we're talking about this here is so that it can gently prod those who have been fortunate enough to get, to give back. We're in this together."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Current situation is an amazing opportunity to fix Australia’s domestic cricket setups, says Langer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia coach Justin Langer is looking at the extended break in cricket due to the coronavirus pandemic as an opportunity to fix the issues that have seeped into the country’s once thriving state and club level setups.
There was a time when the country would field an ‘A’ squad alongside its main team for an annual limited overs triangular series in the Australian summer.
“It wasn’t that long ago that we prided ourselves on having an amazing club cricket system that fed into state domestic cricket, which fed into the best of the best playing for Australia,” Langer told ABC Grandstand on Fox Sports.
“I see it [the current situation] as an amazing opportunity. I can see it [domestic cricket setup] actually going back that way.
“More emphasis back on club cricket, more emphasis on state cricket then get the best of the best in Australia. That would be my vision for the next five years,” the former opener, who payed at a time when Australia were a dominant force in world cricket, added.
Under normal circumstances, the Australian players would have assembled in Brisbane before flying to Bangladesh for a two-match Test series. But like all other sporting engagements, the pandemic has also led to the postponement of that tour.
“We’ve got to make sure they’re all in tip-top condition. I actually can’t wait to see how they come back without all the bells and whistles... it’s going to be a really good indication of the hungry, self-resilient and self-reliant players,” the coach said.
Under Langer’s guidance, Australia recently grabbed the number one position in Tests at the expense of India.
Langer has been regularly offering feedback during Cricket Australia chief executive Kevin Roberts’ discussions with staff, while also staying in touch with players and helping them with his advice amid this pandemic.
“We’ve got to keep moving the ship in the right direction ... our guys come back off their leave on May 18.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia coach Justin Langer is looking at the Covid-19pandemic as “an amazing opportunity” to fix the issues that have seeped into the country’s once-thriving state and club level setups.

Cricket Australia has secured a loan of USD 50 million, an upfront payment as part of a larger USD 200 million credit, which it has sought to cover the losses if India fail to tour the country later this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
According to a report published in The Sydney Morning Herald, stakeholders have been informed that the loan with the Commonwealth Bank is a “done deal”.
However, it raised fresh questions about the governing body’s decision to stand down 80 percent of its staff last month due to financial crisis.
CA stood down more than 200 staff on 20 percent pay until the end of June with chief executive Kevin Roberts fearing they might run out of money by August if the drastic cuts were not made.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Pakistan bowler says players underperformed in 2009 in a ‘conspiracy’ against captain Younis Khan - Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Pakistan fast bowler Rana Navd-ul-Hasan has reportedly revealed that some of the team’s players underperformed deliberately in the ODI series against New Zealand in the UAE back in 2009. According to a report in Cricket Pakistan, Rana told a Pakistani news channel that the players did not give their best on the field as they were not comfortable playing under then skipper Younis Khan.
“We lost two ODI matches against New Zealand in UAE during 2009 because some of the players involved deliberately did not play well, and I sat out that tour,” Naved said.

He further explained that he dropped out of the tour because he had already told Younis Khan that there is a “conspiracy” against him. “I did not play because I had told Younis Khan that this was the conspiracy against you and that I am also a part of that plot,” he said.
Naved added that Younis had changed after he was given the captaincy role, and there were some senior members of the team who involved him in the affair to further their aims. “This was not a rebellion against Younis Khan. He was a good cricketer and I did play alongside him so there were no issues except that when he became captain, he became a different person,” he said.
“Some seniors, and I won’t name names as they may have had aspirations of being captains themselves, got us involved in this whole affair as well to further their aims. We were about seven to eight people involved in this,” he added.
Naved further added that there were some big names of Pakistan cricket who were involved in the whole scheme. “We were all called into a room and an oath of allegiance taken and the people in that room were some big names of Pakistan cricket. If I mention those names, then they will get angry with me,” he said.

“They said we don’t want him to be removed but we would like the PCB Chairman to reason with Younis Khan as he does not take the advice of seniors as captain and does what he feels likes doing,” he added.
“I went along with this thinking that if this is the only matter and the PCB Chairman tells him that, then I don’t have an issue with this,” he further said.
Pakistan suffered a 2-1 defeat in the three-match ODI series, despite winning the first game by 138 runs. They lost the 2nd match by 64 runs and then suffered a 7-run defeat in the third ODI.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Senior Pakistan players under-performed during 2009 New Zealand series: Rana Naved</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KARACHI: Former Pakistan pacer Rana Naved ul Hassan has alleged that a number of senior players "deliberately under-performed" during the 2009 ODI series against New Zealand in the UAE as they were unhappy with Younis Khan's captaincy.
The 42-year-old Rana, who played 9 Tests, 74 ODIs and 4 T20Is for Pakistan, specifically spoke about two ODIs during that tour.
"We lost two ODI matches against New Zealand in the UAE during 2009 because some of the players involved deliberately did not play well," Rana told a local news channel.
The pacer also claimed he pulled out of the tour because he didn't want to be a part of the conspiracy by seniors against the skipper.

It was after the 2009 Champions Trophy in South Africa where some players gathered together and reportedly vowed to oust Younis as they felt he was too "arrogant and abusive".
"I preferred to sit out of the tour. But I had informed Younis Khan that this was a conspiracy against you and that they wanted me to be part of it," he said.
Rana, however, maintained that it was not a rebellion against Younis, the person but Younis as captain.
"After he (Younis) became captain, his personality and attitude changed and some seniors (he didn't name them), who harboured ambitions of leading the side didn't want to play under him."
The senior players during that phase were Mohammed Yousuf, Shahid Afridi, Shoaib Malik, Kamran Akmal and Saeed Ajmal.
Pakistan lost the three-match ODI series, 1-2 despite winning the first match in a convincing fashion by 138 runs. They lost the remaining two matches by 64 and seven runs, respectively.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Pakistan players deliberately played badly in conspiracy against Younis Khan’s captaincy: Rana Naved</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Pakistan cricket Rana Naved-ul-Hasan has revealed that many players in the team, including some “big names of Pakistani cricket” were in a “conspiracy” against captain Younis Khan in 2009.
Speaking about a series against New Zealand in 2009 on a local television channel, Naved said, “We lost two ODI matches against New Zealand in UAE during 2009 because some of the players involved deliberately did not play well. I sat out that tour. I did not play because I had told Younis Khan that this was the conspiracy against you and that I am also a part of that plot,” as quoted by Cricket Pakistan.
Naved went on to explain that there were some senior players in the team then who may have had aspirations of being captain themselves, adding that there were “about seven to eight people involved” in the plot.
“This was not a rebellion against Younis Khan. He was a good cricketer, there were no issues except that when he became captain, he became a different person,” he said.
Saying that he will not take names of the players involved, Naved revealed that the players took an oath of allegiance once, saying that they wanted the PCB chairman to reason with Younis Khan. “They said we don’t want him to be removed but we would like the PCB Chairman to reason with Younis Khan as he does not take advice of seniors as captain and does what he feel likes doing,” said Naved.
Naved played nine Tests and picked 18 wickets at an average of 58, but had a more successful ODI career, claiming 110 wickets in 74 ODIs at an average of 29.28 and an economy rate of 5.57. He played his last match for Pakistan in February 2010.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NORMAN — The top dual-threat quarterback in the 2021 recruiting class has OU in his final three.
Caleb Williams, a five-star recruit from Washington, D.C., announced the Sooners — along with LSU and Maryland — were in his final three.
Williams (6-foot-1, 200 pounds) visited Norman in early March.
He is No. 3 on Rivals' rankings of the top recruits in the 2021 class.
The Sooners signed three-star quarterback Chandler Morris late in the 2020 recruiting cycle after snagging five-star recruit Spencer Rattler in the 2019 class.
Rattler, who redshirted last season, is widely expected to be OU's starting quarterback this season.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">JJ Jones is a recruit on the rise in the 2021 cycle. The three-star receiver took to Twitter Saturday evening to announce his top five schools of his recruitment.
The South Carolina native’s top five includes his home state Gamecocks, North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Mississippi State, per his Twitter announcement. The three-star WR currently ranks as the No. 67 WR and 414th overall prospect in the 2021 cycle, according to the 247Sports Composite Score. More importantly, he’s the third highest-rated prospect in South Carolina. 247’s internal ranking has JJ Jones as a four-star player.
Many expect Jones to end up with Will Muschamp and the Gamecocks given his hometown’s proximity to the University of South Carolina campus. But it’s still very early in his recruitment.
Jones’ top five schools announcement included a creative graphic modeled after the popular video game “Fortnite.” Check it out below:
South Carolina may be the favorite here, but North Carolina is a team to watch. Jones’ recruitment will likely come down to the two rivals, adding another level to the “Battle of the Carolinas.” UNC currently has the No. 2 class in the entire country, per 247’s composite rankings.
Each Carolina program appears to be on the rise within their respective conferences. Both schools are led by terrific recruiters in Mack Brown (UNC) and Muschamp (USC).
This will be a major recruiting battle to watch in coming months. Where do you think Jones will end up?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sylvia's Memory recalled with quiet confidence after 15 months</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's not often one destroys the opposition on debut, and by her third start was competing against a soon-to-be star sprinter and dual Group 1 winner, but that's the early memory for a three-year-old filly having her first run in nearly 15 months at Monday's feature Grafton meeting.
Sylvia's Memory from the Marc Quinn yard at Port Macquarie hasn't started since early February 2019 when she finished down the track behind Bivouac and Cosmic Force as a two-year-old in the Listed Lonhro Stakes at Warwick Farm.
That came only a few weeks after she exploded on the scene with a dominant 800m maiden win at Coffs Harbour, ironically thrashing Gosford filly Divine Approach who she meets again in this Class 1 Handicap over 1015m.
Talk about the swings and roundabouts of racing. Sylvia's Memory was sidelined for about a year before finally returning with a clean bill of health at the trials a month ago and has been taken along quietly since.
Conversely, Divine Approach who resumes off a more routine spell for the Tony Newing stable, went on to have three more runs in the autumn of 2019 against some of the better two-year-olds before returning for a consistent spring campaign, never missing a place and landing her maiden fourth-up as a hot favourite at Dubbo.
For punters, it's an intriguing recipe, even before you throw in well-performed Far North Coast mare Unimpeded in what looms as a potentially strong form reference.
Meanwhile, in one of the most open BM 66 Handicap (1620m) seen in a long while, an unlikely six-year-old who opened at better than 50/1 in early markets can shock a stack of seemingly better-credentialed runners.
Kempsey-based I've Got This made up a stack of late ground third-up in similar company, and with a little drop in weight, better draw and stepping beyond the mile, he can charge home and shake the life out of a race that is an exotic punter's paradise.
At shorter odds, although still great value in a wide market, progressive four-year-old Coffs gelding Galway also looks primed fourth-up after hitting the line hard in consecutive BM 58s, and generally improves further getting back on top of the ground.
And in what looms as a two-horse war in the feature Bushgrove Cup (1215m) to close the card, track specialist Exclusive, with four of his five wins at Grafton, locks horns with early favourite Magnalane fresh off a smart trial win and a terrific closing run in the Country Championship final at Randwick a month back.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AFL biased toward Victorian clubs, says Rockliff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Port Adelaide midfielder Tom Rockliff says the AFL is biased toward Victorian teams after the league's ruling to prevent certain clubs resuming group training.
The Western Australian government has lifted the local limit on outdoor gatherings to 10 people with the state's COVID-19 cases declining.
The ruling in WA matches that of South Australia and would have allowed teams in those states to expand their training groups as the AFL moves towards restarting the postponed season.
Gold Coast chief executive Mark Evans has confirmed the two Queensland clubs - the Suns and Brisbane Lions - could also ramp up training if given approval by the AFL after the state government on Friday eased restrictions.
But the AFL quickly stepped in to ensure the 10 Victorian clubs, along with Sydney and GWS, were not disadvantaged by different restrictions in different states, stressing all 18 teams must abide by initial rules where players can only train with one other person.
While Rockliff – who captained Brisbane and has spent his entire 191-game career outside of Victoria – could understand the AFL's predicament, he was still frustrated by the stance.
"I sort of get where the AFL's coming from. They wanted to go with Scott Morrison's advice and the federal government," Rockliff told ABC Radio.
"The ability for us to train in groups would have been handy but as we know the AFL makes the rules and it's generally got a bias towards Victorian teams, and that's just the way it goes.
"It's something we have to adjust to but I sort of understand it in this scenario."
Greater Western Sydney's Phil Davis could see both sides of the argument, but was not in favour of restricting training for players of teams based in states that are easing lockdown rules.
"I see both sides of it, in the sense that, to an extent there is a competitive advantage to being able to train in [groups of] 10," he told ABC Grandstand.
"You know, training in twos at the moment is extremely difficult, [we're] working quite hard to stay fit. It makes footy drills a bit harder, motivation can be a bit harder as well, not being [together] in that sense.
"I'm also of the belief that if they're allowed to, let them go, because if that's the difference between me winning and losing a game in a month or so's time, or two months' time, I'd be pretty disappointed, as an elite athlete.
"And I'm also a bit of the view that if someone else has a freedom, you shouldn't take it away from them just because someone else doesn't have it.
"I see the argument from both sides. I see that there is an advantage, but I also see that, if that's the difference between me winning or losing, I'd be pretty disappointed in myself."
Port Adelaide football boss Chris Davies disagreed with his midfielder, saying the AFL's equalisation move is fair in the current climate of uncertainty.
"We have the potential to be able to train with more than two people, but we're also going into a period now where there's 15 to 17 of our guys who are going to have to quarantine for two weeks," he told ABC Radio.
"It's really important from here that everyone gets an opportunity to have some form of level playing field."
West Coast chief executive Trevor Nisbett is expecting the AFL to soon revisit the rules surrounding group training.
"At the moment, we can have our players around in groups of 10, by law, but protocols from the AFL are you can only do it in pairs," he said.
"That will change very rapidly and hopefully we'll be able to at least start training with groups of 10 and then a few weeks down the track we may be able to get a full group of guys training together."

    <h5 class="mb-1">AFL biased toward Victorian clubs, says Rockliff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Port Adelaide midfielder Tom Rockliff says the AFL is biased toward Victorian teams after the league's ruling to prevent certain clubs resuming group training.
The Western Australian government has lifted the local limit on outdoor gatherings to 10 people with the state's COVID-19 cases declining.
The ruling in WA matches that of South Australia and would have allowed teams in those states to expand their training groups as the AFL moves towards restarting the postponed season.
Gold Coast chief executive Mark Evans has confirmed the two Queensland clubs - the Suns and Brisbane Lions - could also ramp up training if given approval by the AFL after the state government on Friday eased restrictions.
But the AFL quickly stepped in to ensure the 10 Victorian clubs, along with Sydney and GWS, were not disadvantaged by different restrictions in different states, stressing all 18 teams must abide by initial rules where players can only train with one other person.
While Rockliff – who captained Brisbane and has spent his entire 191-game career outside of Victoria – could understand the AFL's predicament, he was still frustrated by the stance.
"I sort of get where the AFL's coming from. They wanted to go with Scott Morrison's advice and the federal government," Rockliff told ABC Radio.
"The ability for us to train in groups would have been handy but as we know the AFL makes the rules and it's generally got a bias towards Victorian teams, and that's just the way it goes.
"It's something we have to adjust to but I sort of understand it in this scenario."
Greater Western Sydney's Phil Davis could see both sides of the argument, but was not in favour of restricting training for players of teams based in states that are easing lockdown rules.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NFL will release schedule next week, season expected to start as planned despite coronavirus, report says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NFL isn’t planning on adjusting its 2020 schedule amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report.
With its schedule set for release next week, NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said that the regular season is expected to start as planned on Sept. 10, and the Super Bowl in Tampa Bay is still set for Feb. 7, ESPN reported.
"We plan to start on time," McCarthy said.
CAM NEWTON WILL NOT ACCEPT JOB AS BACKUP QB, REPORT SAYS
ESPN said that the league has looked into alternative plans, including working with the NFL Players Association and medical professionals to establish protocols, if the coronavirus outbreak were to continue.
The Sports Business Journal reported last Monday that possible contingencies discussed by the league included delaying the start of the season until Oct. 15 and moving the Super Bowl back to Feb. 28. Last month, the Washington Post reported that the league was looking into playing games in empty or partially filled stadiums.
The NFL Network reported on March 31 that the league has planned to release the schedule no later than May 9. So far, the NFL has adjusted some of its offseason activities because of the coronavirus. One of the first activities was the NFL Draft, which took place virtually with coaches and executives from all 32 teams operating from their homes.

The league and players association agreed to a voluntary virtual offseason program ending no later than May 15 since team facilities have been closed.
There have not yet been any changes to the preseason schedule, with the Dallas Cowboys and Pittsburgh Steelers still on track to play the Hall of Fame Game on Aug. 6.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NFL: League on track for full season starting on September 10</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - The National Football League (NFL), the only major American sporting league so far largely unaffected by the coronavirus outbreak, says it is on course to begin its season on time in September.
“We plan announcing late next week the full regular season schedule that begins with Kickoff on September 10 and culminates with the Super Bowl in Tampa February 7, 2021,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said in an email to Reuters.
Each team is expected to play 16 regular season games as per usual, though the league is evaluating contingency plans should this prove untenable, multiple media outlets have reported.
It is yet to be announced whether fans will be allowed to attend games.
While other major sporting leagues, including the National Basketball Association (NBA) and Major League Baseball (MLB), have shut down due to the coronavirus, the NFL has been able to buy time before making any major decisions.
Its season ended in early February, shortly before evidence of a major coronavirus outbreak in the United States became widely known.
Some areas of the U.S. are now starting to emerge from lockdown as rules are relaxed even as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases rises in some states.
Last week’s NFL draft attracted record U.S. television ratings in a country starved of live sporting action.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Injured MLB Stars Like Verlander, Sale, Syndergaard, Judge Benefit From Delayed 2020 Season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Nobody is happy that COVID-19 is indefinitely delaying the start to the 2020 Major League Baseball season. Let’s make that clear. We all wish that everyone would be safe and healthy and that there was no pandemic impacting countless lives around the world.
All 30 teams get their revenue from hosting games, concession sales, television deals and sponsorships. Aside from already signed local and national TV deals, baseball is dramatically impacted by the loss of games for a season, unlike the NBA and NHL, that has yet to begin. According to various reports, best-case estimates would have the season start in late June or early July with teams playing at least half the season in either Florida, Arizona, Texas or who else knows where, without fans in attendance.
Regardless, we’re not having a normal, regular 162 games baseball season this year. And while that’s damaging and detrimental to virtually everyone, from the teams, the broadcast rights holders, the struggling MiLB franchises across the country and its tens of millions of fans, there are some parties that oddly benefit.
If you’re an injured player and elected to get some kind of long-term procedure done thinking that you’d miss significant time this season, the COVID-delayed campaign has provided a twisted silver lining of sorts. For Houston Astros starting pitcher Justin Verlander, who was expected to miss months following right groin surgery, he may not miss any of the 2020 season at all. With Gerrit Cole now a member of the Yankees, more on them later, Houston needs as much certainty it can get with all the turmoil around the team following its offseason cheating scandal that will follow it wherever the team may go for a while.
After its own cheating scandal and trading franchise cornerstone Mookie Betts to the Los Angeles Dodgers, the Boston Red Sox were expected to go through a transitional season under new chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom and caretaker manager Ron Roenicke. That must’ve made the decision easier for lefty starter Chris Sale to undergo Tommy John surgery on March 30.
The Astros’ cheating scandal also impacted the New York Mets, who will eventually have Luis Rojas manage his first ever big league game rather than Carlos Beltran, but they were going to make a concerted effort to contend for the playoffs in 2020. Though Noah Syndergaard won’t be taking the mound in 2020 after undergoing his own TJ surgery, he and the team must feel good about the timing of the procedure given the 2020 season’s failure to launch thus far.
An added benefit, as the Med Page Today pointed out, is that hospitals were halting elective procedures like sports-related injuries to deal with the massive influx of coronairus patients. It probably makes guys like Verlander, Sale and Syndergaard pleased with the timing of their surgeries, all things considered.
And all things considered, the New York Yankees may benefit the most from this delay. While Luis Severino won’t return in 2020 because of Tommy John, lefty starter James Paxton may not miss any of the season despite a months-long recovery period following March back surgery. And if Paxton, Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Aaron Hicks and the rest of the banged up Bronx Bombers can return when the first pitch of the season is finally thrown, it may be enough to ensure that a year of this franchise’s championship window under manager Aaron Boone isn’t wasted.
As fans of the game endure the first delayed start to a baseball season in 25 years, everyone knows that the teams and players are doing whatever they can to safely take the field as soon as they can. But for players either on the mend or missing the season entirely due to injury, a 2020 season that won’t start until the summer may be something they won’t complain as loudly about.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NFL to release full schedule next week, report says; on-time start planned</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It's impossible to know how events will unfold in the coming months, but right nowthe NFL ismaintaining a business-as-usual approach, at least as it relates to the2020schedule.
In the next few days, the league will release a full 17-week schedule thatbegins with a Sept. 10 opener and ends with Super Bowl 55 on Feb. 7, league spokesman Brian McCarthytold ESPN on Saturday.
Four months would stand between an early May schedule release and the first game, and the coronavirus pandemic obviously could complicate matters. NFL executive vice president Troy Vincent saidthis week thatthe league is doing "reasonable and responsible planning" in regards to COVID-19.
The league has several contingency plans that could include a delayed start to the season and pushing back the Super Bowl, according to The Associated Press.

Other reports have mentioned the possibility of the NFL playing on Saturdays if the college football season is canceled or delayed, but ESPN reports the soon-to-be-released schedule isn't expected to include an "influx"ofSaturday contests.
The NFL kept free agency and the draft on schedule in March and April, respectively, and both events were met with great success. A 17-week schedule with no delays appears to be nextas the league does itsbest to keep moving full-steam ahead.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NBA News: League Could Delay Start Of New Season To December In Order To Bring In Fans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 2, 2020
Danny Cox
Even though they haven’t yet finished their current year of play, the NBA is already looking at possibly delaying the start of next season.
The coronavirus pandemic has brought a halt to virtually all professional and amateur sports around the world. Nearly two months ago, the NBA was the first professional league to suspend its season after canceling a couple of games on March 11.
With no real way of knowing if the current season will resume and achieve completion, eyes are already looking ahead to 2020. ESPN is reporting that commissioner Adam Silver and the NBA board of governors are discussing a delayed start to the 2020-21 season, which wouldn’t have it begin until December.
The regular season for the NBA typically begins in October each year.
The main idea behind a possible delay of the start of next season would be to have more time to get fans in the seats. Governors around the country are looking at allowing professional sports to resume soon, but they would still have to play games with little to no fans in attendance.
The NBA feels as if they could have fans back in arenas and not lose additional revenue with the granting of extra time before next season. Not everyone on the board of governors feels as if fans would return by the end of the year.
One member told ESPN, “If you start in December, that doesn’t mean the people are coming back in December, but maybe, they’re back by March.”
Discussions will be ongoing, with no decision officially made for the start of the 2020 season. On Friday, the NBA board of governors did vote to postpone the draft lottery and draft combine, which were both slated for May dates in Chicago.
The 2020 NBA Draft is still on track to take place on June 25, but postponement is not out of the question. A final decision won’t be made on the draft until a bit more time passes. If things continue on this path, another vote would also be needed.
If the current NBA season does resume and doesn’t end until early fall, the next season would have to be delayed or even shortened.
On Saturday, the NFL announced they would release a full 17-game schedule next week. Commissioner Roger Goodell says there is no intention of delaying or altering any plans for the 2020 regular season. No changes will take place unless the coronavirus pandemic worsens in the coming months.

The NBA is mulling the idea of pushing the start of the 2020-21 season until December as the coronavirus pandemic continues to impede the league’s ability to finish out the current season, reports say.
Commissioner Adam Silver and the NBA board of governors met Friday to address a number of concerns regarding how to proceed after the season was suspended on March 11. Among the plans discussed was the possibility of pushing the start of the 2020-21 season until December, ESPN reported, citing league sources.
NBA PUSHES BACK DRAFT COMBINE, DRAFT LOTTERY
"If you start in December, that doesn't mean the people are coming back in December, but maybe they're back by March," one member of the board told ESPN.
If the plan is carried out, the season would reportedly begin just before Christmas and run into late July or early August.
The league also decided Friday to delay the draft lottery and draft combine, events scheduled for Chicago later this month.
The lottery cannot occur until the regular season is completed or is declared over, because team records determine the odds that the 14 non-playoff teams will have of securing the right to pick No. 1 overall in the draft.

For now, the draft remains scheduled for June 25 — though that, too, will likely have to change in the coming weeks as the league continues reacting to the coronavirus pandemic.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Now, this is some news sports fans wanted to hear.
Late next week, the National Football League will be releasing its full 17-week 2020 schedule without any changes to it, despite the coronavirus still being around. League spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed to ESPN that the schedule will include its September 7th opener, the Super Bowl on its regular day, and visions of fans in the stands as normal.
The initial schedule also won’t have any Saturday games despite the idea being thrown around earlier this week.
The NFL also isn’t considering gathering players in one location in order to save the season, something that has been brought up by the NBA, MLB, and NHL.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NFL is planning on starting the 2020 season on time despite current public health concerns.
The COVID-19 outbreak has made sports league commissioners think twice as to whether to play out the 2020 seasons. The NCAA essentially had no other choice but to cancel the remainder of its 2020 winter and spring sports seasons. The NBA and MLB continue to be postponed, but there’s optimism both can return later this summer.
College football remains months away from the start of its season. But the involvement of universities could force the NCAA to once again postpone or either cancel the upcoming college football year. Fortunately for the NFL, it can be much more liberal with its plans.
Roger Goodell and the NFL are planning to release the 2020 schedule, without any changes, next week. The league is moving forward with the idea the season will start on time with fans in the stands.
“We plan to start on time,” NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said, via ESPN.
Of course, this doesn’t ensure the NFL won’t eventually alter the 2020 schedule.
The league continues to monitor the public health dilemma.
In all likelihood, the NFL will find a way to play out the upcoming season – even if it includes games without any fans in attendance.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NFL will release the 2020 game schedule next week, and despite talk of alternative scheduling or a late start because of the coronavirus, it is expected to be a business-as-usual slate.
ESPN reported on Saturday that the 17-week season will open on September 10 and close with the Super Bowl on February 7 in Tampa, Floride, citing league spokesman Brian McCarthy.
"We plan to start on time," McCarthy said.
The league has discussed contingency plans, however.
Sports Business Daily reported on Monday that the NFL was forming contingency plans in case its schedule of games needs to be altered, including delaying season openers by more than a month and moving the Super Bowl to the end of February.
It's unclear whether the coronavirus outbreak will ease enough to allow fans in the stands. ESPN said the NFL won't hunker players in specific locations to play the season, as the NHL, MLB and NBA have discussed.
ESPN also reported that the schedule isn't expected to include early season Saturday games. It had been speculated the NFL might schedule games on Saturday since the college football season remains up in the air.
In the meantime, NFL facilities remain closed, and teams have begun holding virtual workouts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NFL set to release full 17-week schedule next week, league spokesman says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NFL isn't altering its fall plans.
The league will release its 2020 schedule late next week without any major changes, league spokesman Brian McCarthy confirmed -- including a Sept. 10 opener, the Super Bowl on Feb. 7 and visions of fans in the stands.
"We plan to start on time," McCarthy said.
ESPN's Chris Mortensen reported in mid-April that the league planned to release its schedule, based on a full season, by May 9. NFL executive vice president Troy Vincent told The Associated Press this week that the league is doing "reasonable and responsible planning" regarding health and safety during the coronavirus pandemic.
The league has evaluated contingency plans should the pandemic intensify, working in conjunction with the NFL Players Association and medical experts on a set of protocols.
One of those contingencies is delaying the season until mid-October, according to the Sports Business Journal. Empty stadiums and no bye weeks have long been discussed.
One option not on the table, a source told ESPN, is gathering players at a centralized location to execute a season. The NBA and Major League Baseball have discussed playing at a neutral site such as Walt Disney World, Las Vegas or Arizona, but the NFL doesn't plan to do that.
The NFL schedule is not expected to include an influx of Saturday games, despite uncertainty about whether college football can start its season on time.
The league is evaluating when players can reenter team facilities. The NFL and NFLPA have agreed to keep buildings closed until every state in which a team resides lifts its stay-at-home mandate. Teams are prepared to conduct offseason workouts and June minicamps virtually.
NFL commissioner Roger Goodell will not accept a salary during the pandemic. The league raised more than $100 million for coronavirus relief during the NFL draft.

The NFL plans to reveal an unaltered 2020 schedule late next week, according to ESPN‘s Jeremy Fowler, despite the COVID-19 pandemic that has put most sports leagues in the Western world on pause and the resumption of their seasons in question.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Cologne plan quarantine-like training camp, Verstraete backtracks over comments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cologne are planning to move into a "quarantine-like" training camp after the Bundesliga club were hit with three positive coronavirus tests.
On Friday, Cologne announced three unspecified people at the club contracted COVID-19 amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has brought the Bundesliga and sport to a standstill globally.
The trio – which reportedly consists of two players and a physio – were consequently told to undergo a 14-day quarantine procedure.
A decision on the potential resumption of the Bundesliga is set to be made on Wednesday and Cologne announced they will head into a training camp in a protected location if politicians approve to conclude the 2019-20 campaign.
"This form of voluntary quarantine extends the existing infection control and hygiene concept and is intended to further reduce the risk of infection from COVID-19," Cologne said on Sunday. "The measure will be/has been taken regardless of the results of the COVID-19 tests at FC.
"The concept of the 'Task Force Sports Medicine/ Extraordinary Matchday Operation' of the DFL already provides that all teams go to quarantine-like training camps one week before the games restart. FC, however, prefer to start this period at the beginning of team training."
It comes after Cologne midfielder Birger Verstraete expressed his concern with the club still training amid the positive COVID-19 tests – though the Belgian has since apologised.
Verstraete spoke to Belgian TV station VTM and criticised Cologne for their handling of the three positive cases.
After Cologne responded and dismissed Verstraete's comments, the 26-year-old said: "I gave an interview about my personal concerns about my girlfriend potentially getting the virus. I expressed myself falsely in a few places, so that in the translation a misunderstanding has came about and I am sorry for that.
"Instead of giving an interview out of emotion, I should have contacted our doctor and had my questions answered. It was not my intention to blame the responsible authorities or Cologne. I feel comfortable and in good hands with FC.
"I will continue to give my all in training ... and I want to end the season in Cologne. My girlfriend, who belongs to the risk group because of a previous heart disease, will head home to Belgium and stay there for the time being."

    <h5 class="mb-1">German top-flight soccer team train on after positive coronavirus tests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cologne's players are continuing to train despite three positive tests for coronavirus at the club that have unsettled the German soccer league's restart plans.
Cologne said last week that three people had tested positive but didn't name them or say whether they were players, who are currently training in small groups.
"The experts evaluate it as such that, due to the hygiene and infection prevention measures in group training, we can continue to train with those who tested negatively as we had been," team doctor Paul Klein said on the club website.
Klein added that no one at the club was considered "category one" in respect of the three individuals who gave samples Thursday.
That is typically someone who either lives with an infected person or had close contact with them.
Players and staff around the league began giving samples on Thursday as part of an ongoing process designed to enable teams to return initially to full training, then to games later this month.
Most teams have not commented on test results.
Werder Bremen said samples given on Thursday by its players and staff were all negative and that they will undergo another round of testing on Sunday.
Meanwhile in Italy, Sassuolo are set to become the first Serie A side to re-start training following the coronavirus shutdown after saying their players could use the club's facilities from Monday on an optional basis.
Regional neighbours Bologna, meanwhile, say their players will be able to start training from Tuesday.
Serie A has been suspended since March 9 and the league and the Italian soccer federation (FIGC) both want to complete the season although the Italian government says it has not yet decided whether it will give permission.
The government has given professional teams permission to train together from May 18 although they will still have to respect social distancing guidelines.
Sassuolo and Bologna are based in the region of Emilia Romagna which has given special permission for athletes in team sports to take part in training sessions on an individual basis from May 4 onwards.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cologne continues training despite tests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">COLOGNE, Germany — Cologne's players are continuing to train despite the three positive tests for coronavirus at the club that have unsettled the German soccer league's restart plans.
Cologne said Friday that three people had tested positive but didn't name them or say whether they were players, who are currently training in small groups.
“The experts evaluate it as such that, due to the hygiene and infection prevention measures in group training, we can continue to train with those who tested negatively as we had been,” team doctor Paul Klein said on the club website Saturday.
Klein added nobody at the club was considered “category one” in respect of the three individuals who gave samples Thursday. That is typically someone who either lives with an infected person or had close contact with them.
Cologne's announcement brought criticism from Karl Lauterbach, a lawmaker with the Social Democratic Party, the junior partner in Angela Merkel's coalition government.
Lauterbach said on Twitter that “probably two players, one staffer” were infected. He is a professor of health economics and was based at Cologne University before entering politics.
“I am surprised that players allow this to be done to them. Football should be a role model, not ‘bread and circuses,’” he wrote in reference to training sessions.
Players and staff around the league began giving samples Thursday as part of an ongoing process designed to enable teams to return initially to full training, then to games later this month.
Most teams have not commented on test results. Werder Bremen said samples given Thursday by its players and staff were all negative, and that they will undergo another round of testing Sunday. Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfurt also reported only negative tests.
One player from another Bundesliga club, Paderborn, tested positive in March.

Meanwhile, “we have reason to be very optimistic," the club's managing director, Alexander Wehrle, told German broadcaster Sky Sports News.
"We can continue training as we have been. The plan has been approved by the authorities and it is sustainable."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus latest: Three people test positive at Bundesliga club Koln</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The German top flight looks set to become the first major league to return to action as the world continues to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.
Clubs are back in training with a mid-May resumption on the cards, but Cologne's arrangements have received a setback.
The club, 10th in the Bundesliga, said that "after three positive tests, three people at FC Koln are now in quarantine" – but also that "the group training can continue".
In a statement, Cologne said: "FC Koln had the entire team and coaching staff, along with the backroom staff, tested on Thursday for Covid-19. Three people tested positive, all are symptom free.
"After an assessment of the cases by the responsible health authorities, the three people who tested positive will go into a 14-day quarantine at home. FC Koln will not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those affected.
"FC Koln's training can continue as planned, according to the hygiene and infection control measures that have been in place since April 6 in group training.
"The prerequisite for this is that the relevant group of people are tested further, as stated for in the medical concept of the 'Taskforce Sports Medicine/Special Game Operation' from the DFL."
The procedure discussed on Friday with the taskforce's chair Professor Dr Tim Meyer, medical director of the Institute for Sports and Preventive Medicine at Saarland University, and Professor Dr Barbara Gartner, specialist in microbiology and infection epidemiology.
Meyer said: "We now see in everyday life that our concept recognises and reduces risks at an early stage.
"We will always be in close contact with the responsible health authorities and medical experts.
"We are convinced that with our concept, we can enable players to practice their profession with the best possible protection against infection."
Cologne managing director Horst Heldt: "The health and private sphere of players and staff have priority above all else.
"The previous measures, as well as the strategy of regular tests, have proven themselves so that we can now react with individual solutions."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MGM Resorts International has pitched a proposal to the NBA to complete the coronavirus-halted 2019-20 season on courts in Las Vegas convention centers, the New York Times reported.
The plan, according to the newspaper, would have players and their families, plus other essential personnel, stay in a quarantined area in MGM hotels along the Las Vegas Strip while practicing and competing on courts in the same facilities.
Players and broadcasters would have access to the usual resort facilities while in the protected area under the plan by MGM, which has 13 Vegas resort properties.
The plan would convert MGM convention centers into 24 basketball courts, five of them equipped with cameras to permit television coverage, and players would reside in connected or nearby hotels.
ESPN has reported the NBA is looking at a similar quarantined area in Orlando involving hotels and courts in private Disney World areas.
The NBA halted its season in March after Utah's Rudy Gobert tested positive for the deadly virus and the league has announced no plan for resuming games or even a timetable for returning to competition.
The league will allow players to conduct individual workouts at team facilities starting Friday in areas where stay-at-home laws allow, the first small step toward resumption.
No plan among those floated in US media has included spectators at games, most focusing on a one-site bubble where players might live and play, and only once coronavirus tests are available in sufficient numbers to the public and the NBA has enough tests for everyone involved.
The Mandalay Bay resort, with 4,700 rooms available over three connected hotels, would be the central hub of the MGM Vegas plan. An enclosed walkway would connect the Luxor, where caterers and housekeepers would reside.

In such a plan, players are expected to need a training camp of more than three weeks to prepare for games, which could include the final month of the regular season and two months of playoff contests.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Had to flee after being constantly threatened by Umar Akmal: Zulqarnain Haider</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KARACHI: Pakistan's former wicketkeeper-batsman Zulqarnain Haider has blamed Umar Akmal for his disappearing act during an ODI series against South Africa in 2010, saying he was threatened by the tainted player for not conniving with him to lose a match.
Zulqarnain claimed that he was forced to leave his team hotel in Dubai and fly out to London under mysterious circumstances after receiving threatening messages from his then teammate Umar and a few others after he refused to under-perform in the third one-day international of the same series.
"I remember telling him to just do his job and carry the drinks. But later he (Umar) and some others directly threatened me and kept on badgering me so much that I came under psychological pressure and fear and flew to London without informing anyone," he said in an interview.
Zulqarnain's promising career ended following that episode in November 2010.

He said the three-year ban on Umar for not revealing spot-fixing approaches is too lenient.
"He has been involved in shady dealings and not only does he deserve a life ban even his property and assets should be seized," Zulqarnain said on Saturday.
Zulqarnain, who is 34 now, had sought asylum in London after leaving the team hotel in Dubai without informing the management.
The wicketkeeper, who scored 88 runs in the only Test he played at Birmingham in 2010 in place of Kamran Akmal, claimed that he had reported the matter of Umar telling him to under-perform to the management.
"But the threats and pressure were too much for me to bear and I left. I was also getting threats from some unknown persons to under perform," he said.
Zulqarnain returned to Lahore in 2011 on the assurances of the then interior minister, Rehman Malik, but he has not been able to resurrect his cricket career.
Pakistan then team's manager, Intikhab Alam, had described Zulqarnain as a troubled young man with mental issues.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Grounds for concern: Brighton chief opposes the idea of games at neutral venues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has voiced opposition to the idea of finishing the Premier League season at neutral venues.
The PA news agency understands clubs were told on Friday that limiting action to a handful of selected stadiums was the only way it would be possible to complete the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season for safety reasons.
The latest updates to ‘Project Restart’ were understood to have been well received at a meeting on Friday, but there remained opposition on competition and integrity grounds about using neutral venues, and Barber confirmed Brighton are among those with reservations.
“Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus,” he said on the club’s website.
“But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.”
Brighton were due to be at home for five of their remaining nine matches as they fight for Premier League survival, and Barber fears the loss of home advantage could prove critical – even without fans.
“The disadvantages of us not playing the league’s top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious,” Barber said.
The PA news agency understands the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing – which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
Some reports had named the Amex as among the stadiums under consideration, but Barber said that was speculation at this stage.
“We haven’t been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches – by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police – and at this point we haven’t been approached to have such a discussion either so I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports,” he said.
West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said that every Premier League club wants to complete the season but has warned there are “a lot of obstacles” to overcome.
“At yesterday’s meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart,” she wrote in her column for the Sun.
“We all know that it is going to take a lot of working together, good faith, careful thought and compromises if we have any chance of that happening.
“The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game…
Brady has detailed a four-phase strategy for a return to action, with the first one – isolated training sessions at training grounds – already under way.
Phase two would be a return to group training, phase three is the restart of domestic games, and the final phase would see a return to international matches.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Premier League clubs have given the green light to play the remaining 2019-20 matches at eight neutral venues up and down the country, according to reports.
The clubs were presented with the league's 'Project Restart' plans at a meeting on Friday, and while a statement was issued reconfirming the clubs' commitment to finishing the season, it is understood there is no possibility that it can now finish on a home-and-away basis for safety reasons.
The restart plans were understood to have been well received, but there remains opposition on competition and integrity grounds about the idea of finishing the season at neutral venues.
It is understood the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing - which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
The Sun has listed eight venues on the table to complete the season, with Brighton's Amex Stadium and Southampton St Mary's potentially hosting matches on the south coast.
West Ham's London Stadium and Arsenal's Emirates home have been touted as venues in the capital, while Leicester's King Power and Aston Villa's Villa Park are the Midlands stadiums.
And Manchester United's Old Trafford, along with Manchester City's Etihad, will provide a north west base.
Wembley and St George's Park are back-up options, it is claimed.
It has also been reiterated that no club will play in their own stadium, to try and ensure Premier League integrity is maintained.
It is also understood the EFL is still intent on playing the remainder of its campaigns behind closed doors at the regular venues, but the governing body is aware current plans may need to change.
Clubs are expected to vote on the key principles of 'Project Restart' some time after May 7, when the Government must review the current UK lockdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League clubs 'preparing for entire 2020-21 season to be played out behind closed doors'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Premier League clubs are reportedly preparing for the possibility of playing the entirety of next season behind closed doors.
Discussions around a resumption to the 2019-20 season are due to continue this week, with the hope that the remaining 92 matches can be played throughout the summer months to conclude the campaign.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, fans will not be in attendance for those matches and it’s expected that the start of next season will also begin behind closed doors.
Now, Sky Sportsis reporting that top-flight clubs are preparing for the possibility of the entirety of the 2019-20 campaign taking place without fans in attendance.
Such action would affect all competitions, including the FA Cup and Uefa’s European competitions, and would be a significant blow to the revenue streams of all Premier League clubs.
The possibility of having no fans in attendance for a whole season would be even more devastating for clubs in the lower leagues of the EFL, which would also be affected, where the gate receipts are an important part of the running of the club.
Clubs have already been hit heavily by the financial implications of the crisis, which is expected to have long-lasting effects on the economy both in general and within the sporting world.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why neutral venues could undermine EPL's integrity</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber fears plans to complete the Premier League season at neutral venues could have a "material effect on the integrity of the competition."
As the tournament wrestles with how to finish the campaign which still has 92 games to play, the idea of using up to 10 neutral venues for the behind closed doors games is seen as the only means to guarantee safety.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus," Barber told the Brighton website.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition."
Brighton were due to be at home for five of their remaining nine matches as they fight for their Premier League lives.
Barber worries the loss of home advantage could prove critical - even without fans.
"The disadvantages of us not playing the league's top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious," Barber said.
"Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn't equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn't play our first 29 matches of the season in this way.
"So, in our opinion one thing doesn't cancel out the other."
Britain's Press Associaton claimed the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing - which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
Some reports had even named Brighton's Amex Stadium as among the stadiums under consideration.
However, Barber said it was speculation at this stage.
"We haven't been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches - by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police.
"So I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Wolves could play entire 2020/21 season behind closed doors - report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Wolves and the rest of the Premier League clubs are preparing for the possibility of playing the entirety of next season behind closed doors..
Discussions around a resumption of the 2019/20 season are due to continue this week, with the hope that the remaining 92 matches can be played throughout the summer months to conclude the campaign.
However, due to the coronavirus pandemic, fans will not be in attendance for those matches and it’s expected that the start of next season will also begin behind closed doors.
Now, Sky Sports is reporting that top-flight clubs are preparing for the possibility of the entirety of the 2020/2021 campaign taking place without fans in attendance - which would also impact the EFL, if required to be put in place.
Such action would affect all competitions, including the FA Cup and UEFA’s European competitions, and would be a significant blow to the revenue streams of Premier League clubs.
The possibility of having no fans in attendance for a whole season would be even more devastating for clubs in the lower leagues of the EFL, where the gate receipts are an important part of the running of the club.
Clubs have already been hit heavily by the financial implications of the crisis, which is expected to have long-lasting effects on the economy both in general and within the sporting world.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League Clubs 'Agree' to Use 8-10 Stadiums as Neutral Venues for Remainder of 2019/20 Season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A agreement has been reached among Premier League clubs to play the remainder of the 2019/20 season at neutral grounds across England, with up to ten stadiums in consideration.
Planning is underway to find an amicable method to complete the current campaign, in a bid to avoid the financial and logistical ramifications that would occur if the season is cancelled in its entirety.
As of yet there is no green light from the government to complete the currently postponed season but if the Premier League is given the go-ahead, The Sun have revealed playing the remainder of the fixtures at neutral venues will be the manner to proceed.
After a near four-hour video meeting of the 20 clubs' officials, plans to use 'eight to ten neutral stadiums' was agreed to. General training will resume from 18 May, with the first batch of top-flight fixtures to kick off on 12 June - when Euro 2020 had initially been due to begin.
The eight venues most likely to be used are Brighton’s Amex Stadium and Southampton’s St Mary’s on the south coast, West Ham’s London Stadium and Arsenal’s Emirates Stadium in London, along with Leicester’s King Power Stadium and Aston Villa’s Villa Park in the Midlands.
While up in the north west, Manchester United's Old Trafford and Manchester City's Etihad Stadium would be the other two stadia used. According to the report, six clubs had concerns over the proposal - which would see no side play in their home stadium - although the majority view ruled the decision as the best course of action.
Grounds such as Chelsea's Stamford Bridge and Liverpool's Anfield were discounted with police having fears of using heavily congested urban areas where fans could converge en masse.
A Premier League source said: “It’s pretty clear we will have to play behind closed doors when we come back — including, probably, into next season. Nobody wants that but we cannot deny the reality.
“This is seen by everybody as the best option in the circumstances and we recognise that we must choose venues where we can ensure only those authorised to be there will be in and around thestadium.
“Of course, there are a range of views around the League and clubs. They all have their own stances and positions. But it was generally agreed that we should do everything we can to try to finish the season.”
One noticeable caveat of this plan is that should Liverpool win the league their 25-point lead would suggest they will, then they will do so away from their home, Anfield.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brighton oppose idea of finishing season at neutral venues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The PA news agency understands clubs were told on Friday that limiting action to a handful of selected stadiums was the only way it would be possible to complete the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season for safety reasons.
The latest updates to 'Project Restart' were understood to have been well received at a meeting on Friday, but there remained opposition on competition and integrity grounds about using neutral venues, and Barber confirmed Brighton are among those with reservations.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus," he said on the club's website.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition."
Brighton were due to be at home for five of their remaining nine matches as they fight for Premier League survival, and Barber fears the loss of home advantage could prove critical – even without fans.
"The disadvantages of us not playing the league's top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious," Barber said.
"Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn't equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn't play our first 29 matches of the season in this way.

"We haven't been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches – by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police – and at this point we haven't been approached to have such a discussion either so I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports," he said.
West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said that every Premier League club wants to complete the season but has warned there are "a lot of obstacles" to overcome.
"At yesterday's meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart," she wrote in her column for the Sun.
"We all know that it is going to take a lot of working together, good faith, careful thought and compromises if we have any chance of that happening.
"The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game...
"There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make."
Brady has detailed a four-phase strategy for a return to action, with the first one – isolated training sessions at training grounds – already under way.
Phase two would be a return to group training, phase three is the restart of domestic games, and the final phase would see a return to international matches.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Brighton chief refutes reports of using Amex Stadium as a neutral ground</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brighton and Hove Albion's deputy chairman Paul Barber says the club have not been approached to use the Amex Stadium as a neutral ground in the event of a Premier League restart.
Reports have suggested one option being considered by the Premier League, should the competition be allowed to resume amid the coronavirus crisis, is to hold all matches behind closed doors at neutral venues.
The Amex is rumoured to be one of the grounds under consideration, yet Barber has suggested the reports are, as it stands, wide of the mark.
"We haven't been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches – by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police – and at this point we haven't been approached to have such a discussion either so I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports," Barber wrote in a statement on the club's official website.
"Some newspapers reported that the use of a small number of neutral venues may be the only way to complete the Premier League season to ensure social distancing policies are maintained, and Albion was named as one of a number of clubs against such a move."
Barber also added that Brighton – who were battling relegation prior to the suspension of the season – would not be satisfied with switching matches to neutral stadiums.
"We do of course understand that in the very difficult circumstances we are facing that every option must be considered – but that should only be when safe to do so for all concerned and, if and when we reach that point, we are not in favour of playing our remaining matches at neutral venues," he wrote.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.
"Five of our nine remaining matches due to be played at the Amex – all five matches are very difficult but four are against some of the biggest clubs in European football."
Brighton were set to welcome Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City to the Amex in their next four home matches.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Grounds for concern: Brighton chief opposes the idea of games at neutral venues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paul Barber wary finishing the Premier League season at a handful of selected stadiums.
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber has voiced opposition to the idea of finishing the Premier League season at neutral venues.
The PA news agency understands clubs were told on Friday that limiting action to a handful of selected stadiums was the only way it would be possible to complete the remaining matches of the 2019-20 season for safety reasons.
The latest updates to ‘Project Restart’ were understood to have been well received at a meeting on Friday, but there remained opposition on competition and integrity grounds about using neutral venues, and Barber confirmed Brighton are among those with reservations.
“Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus,” he said on the club’s website.
“But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.”
Brighton were due to be at home for five of their remaining nine matches as they fight for Premier League survival, and Barber fears the loss of home advantage could prove critical – even without fans.
“The disadvantages of us not playing the league’s top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious,” Barber said.
“Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn’t equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn’t play our first 29 matches of the season in this way. So, in our opinion one thing doesn’t cancel out the other.”
The PA news agency understands the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing – which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
Some reports had named the Amex as among the stadiums under consideration, but Barber said that was speculation at this stage.
“We haven’t been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches – by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police – and at this point we haven’t been approached to have such a discussion either so I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports,” he said.
West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady said that every Premier League club wants to complete the season but has warned there are “a lot of obstacles” to overcome.
“At yesterday’s meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart,” she wrote in her column for the Sun.
“We all know that it is going to take a lot of working together, good faith, careful thought and compromises if we have any chance of that happening.
“The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game…
“There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Brady has detailed a four-phase strategy for a return to action, with the first one – isolated training sessions at training grounds – already under way.
Phase two would be a return to group training, phase three is the restart of domestic games, and the final phase would see a return to international matches.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brighton chief's 'integrity' fears in neutral venues plan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brighton chief executive Paul Barber fears plans to complete the Premier League season at neutral venues could have a "material effect on the integrity of the competition."
As the tournament wrestles with how to finish the campaign which still has 92 games to play, the idea of using up to 10 neutral venues for the behind closed doors games is seen as the only means to guarantee safety.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus," Barber told the Brighton website.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition."
Brighton were due to be at home for five of their remaining nine matches as they fight for their Premier League lives.
Barber worries the loss of home advantage could prove critical - even without fans.
"The disadvantages of us not playing the league's top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious," Barber said.

Britain's Press Associaton claimed the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing - which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
Some reports had even named Brighton's Amex Stadium as among the stadiums under consideration.
However, Barber said it was speculation at this stage.
"We haven't been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches - by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Brighton chief refutes reports of using Amex Stadium as a neutral ground</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brighton and Hove Albion's deputy chairman Paul Barber says the club have not been approached to use the Amex Stadium as a neutral ground in the event of a Premier League restart.
Reports have suggested one option being considered by the Premier League, should the competition be allowed to resume amid the coronavirus crisis, is to hold all matches behind closed doors at neutral venues.
The Amex is rumoured to be one of the grounds under consideration, yet Barber has suggested the reports are, as it stands, wide of the mark.
"We haven't been asked if we would consider our stadium being used as a neutral venue for any remaining Premier League matches – by our colleagues at the league, the government or the police – and at this point we haven't been approached to have such a discussion either so I am unable to say why our stadium has been included in the reports," Barber wrote in a statement on the club's official website.
"Some newspapers reported that the use of a small number of neutral venues may be the only way to complete the Premier League season to ensure social distancing policies are maintained, and Albion was named as one of a number of clubs against such a move."
Barber also added that Brighton – who were battling relegation prior to the suspension of the season – would not be satisfied with switching matches to neutral stadiums.
"We do of course understand that in the very difficult circumstances we are facing that every option must be considered – but that should only be when safe to do so for all concerned and, if and when we reach that point, we are not in favour of playing our remaining matches at neutral venues," he wrote.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises, and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.
"Five of our nine remaining matches due to be played at the Amex – all five matches are very difficult but four are against some of the biggest clubs in European football."
Brighton were set to welcome Arsenal, Manchester United, Liverpool and Manchester City to the Amex in their next four home matches.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Aston Villa captain Dennis Mortimer shows the First Division trophy off to a crowd of thousands outside Birmingham Town Hall after the 1980-81 title triumph.
It was Villa’s seventh league championship but their first since 1910 and was sealed despite a 2-0 defeat against Arsenal at Highbury on the final day of the season.
Ron Saunders’ side pipped Ipswich to the summit by four points, with a seven-match winning run from January to March proving pivotal to their success.
Villa used just 14 players over the course of the campaign, with Mortimer one of seven that were ever-present. The others were Jimmy Rimmer, Kenny Swain, Ken McNaught, Des Bremner, Gordon Cowans and Tony Morley.
Mortimer, who had already lifted the League Cup with the club in 1977, went on to captain the Villains to the European Cup in 1982 with a 1-0 victory over Bayern Munich in Rotterdam.
Liverpool-born midfielder Mortimer made nearly 600 appearances in the Football League, which also included a spell at rivals Birmingham, but was never capped by England at senior level.

    <h5 class="mb-1">England 'on edge' over Twenty20 World Cup</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England batsman Jason Roy admits his teammates are "on edge" as they wait to see if they will be able to take part in the Twenty20 World Cup in Australia later this year.
There are serious question marks over the tournament going ahead amid the uncertainties sparked by the global coronavirus pandemic.
The tournament – which offers the likes of Roy a unique opportunity to become double world champions following England's win on home turf in the 50-over competition last year – is scheduled for October, but at present the idea of 16 teams converging in one place seems a potential health risk.
And Roy admitted England's players were beginning to ask their own questions.
"I think all the boys are on edge, waiting for the call," he said.
"If players aren't able to prepare in the right way and are not able to get over to Australia, then it makes sense to postpone it. But if it goes ahead, it's our job to play cricket.
"If we're told we have three weeks to prepare to go and play in the World T20, all the boys will be putting the yards in to make sure we're ready for that. We'll get in the nets and go hit some balls."
Roy has also reflected on his brief stint in Test cricket, which came straight off the back of his World Cup heroics but ended after just five caps following a difficult Ashes series in England last year.
Rory Burns, Dom Sibley and Zak Crawley are all now ahead in the England pecking order as openers but a second chance in the middle order has crossed Roy's mind.
He added: "I think they found a nice couple of players to fill that [opening] spot but I worked very, very hard to crack the nut in Test cricket and for it to get taken away from me that quickly, obviously after a couple of bad scores, was really heartbreaking.
"There's no doubt in my mind that I'm going to be trying my hardest to get back into the side."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19 could lead to hockey’s slow death in Pakistan: PHF</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hockey in Pakistan is already under severe financial stress and the coronaviruspandemic has only made the situation more worrisome and could lead to the slow death of the national sport in the country, said PHF secretary general Asif Bajwa.
With three Olympic gold and four World Cup crowns, Pakistan hockey has a rich history. But of late, the sport is struggling to survive in the country because of lack of sponsors owing to the national team’s poor show at the international stage.
The Covid-19 pandemic has only made the situation critical.
“The coronavirus pandemic is having very negative effects on hockey. Already the PHF and the sport was facing financial crunch in the country and now the situation has only gone from bad to worse,” Bajwa said on Saturday.
He said the pandemic, which has so far claimed close to 2,40,000 lives, had left many players jobless and without any income.
“The federation is also unfortunately not in a financial position where it can do much for these players,” Bajwa, a former Olympian said.
The PHF official said many players, who are employed with departments, are facing problems while those who went to play in professional hockey leagues all over the world to earn good money are also living in uncertainty because of complete halt in sporting activities across the globe.
He said a difficult time is in the offing for sports in Pakistan as and when things return to normal.
“It is a sad story for sports, including hockey in Pakistan right now. When normal activities resume even then the PHF requires lot of money to reactivate hockey and send the senior and junior teams abroad for international events.”
Bajwa urged the government and private sector to step in and bail out hockey. “It is unfortunate but hockey is a sport in which we have been world champions, Olympic gold medallists, Asian champions and won so many titles. But right now hockey is in a very bad state,” he signed off.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Horse racing: Undefeated Nadal is good, but is he a Charlatan?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Is Nadal good enough to beat a Charlatan?
That was the question fans were asking after the two horses were separated into different races at the Arkansas Derby on Saturday.
With the Kentucky Derby, usually run on the first Saturday of May, postponed until September due to the coronavirus, the $1 million Arkansas Derby took centre stage, albeit without spectators on what is usually the biggest day on the American horse racing calendar.
The race over 1 1/8 miles (1,810 metres) for three-year-olds at Hot Springs was divided into two divisions and Charlatan, ridden by Martin Garcia, led all the way to convincingly win the first by six lengths.
But Nadal, named after the tennis player, was equally impressive in the second flight.
Jockey Joel Rosario guided the colt into the lead around the top turn on the Oaklawn Park dirt before pulling away to triumph by three lengths in one minute, 48.34 seconds, marginally faster than Charlatan’s 1:48.49.
Both winners, trained by Bob Baffert, remain unbeaten.
“He’s a champ,” Rosario said of Nadal.
He was speaking of the horse, though he could well have been talking about the 19-times grand slam champion.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Andy Dalton, Cowboys agree to 1-year deal, team announces</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Quarterback Andy Dalton and the Dallas Cowboys agreed to a one-year deal Saturday that guarantees the former Cincinnati Bengals signal-caller $3 million, and it could be worth up to $7 million with incentives.
The agreement was first reported by ESPN.
The Bengals released Dalton this past Thursday, which basically guaranteed No. 1 overall pick Joe Burrow the starting job in Cincinnati. Two days later, the Cowboys came calling for a backup quarterback to starter Dak Prescott.
EAGLES' GM: TEAM 'MARRIED' TO QB CARSON WENTZ
Dalton, who was born and raised in the Houston area, led Texas Christian University [TCU] to an undefeated 2010 season before the Bengals drafted him in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft.
The Cowboys’ backup quarterback to Prescott the past two seasons was Cooper Rush, so Dalton definitely represented a significant upgrade at the position in case Prescott were to hold out due to a contract dispute or if he were to get injured. The Cowboys have placed the franchise tag on Prescott, who hasn't signed the one-year tender worth about $31 million. However, the sides would have until July 15 to get a long-term contract done.
Dalton started 133 games under center for the Bengals and led the franchise to five straight playoff appearances -- from 2011 to 2015 -- but Cincinnati lost in the first round each time, which set an NFL record.

Dalton's 70-61-2 record as a starter was the second-best by a Bengals quarterback with at least 10 starts, trailing Virgil Carter. Dalton held the club records for touchdown passes (204) and completions (2,757).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dallas Cowboys News: Andy Dalton Finds A New Home With One-Year Deal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3, 2020
Danny Cox
It took less than a week for quarterback Andy Dalton to go from a free agent to a new home in Texas. Earlier this week, Dalton was released by the Cincinnati Bengals after nine years with the team. He has never played a single snap for another team during his NFL career, but that is going to change now since the Dallas Cowboys have signed him to a one-year deal.
ESPN is reporting that Dalton, who was released by Cincinnati on Thursday, struck a deal with the Cowboys on a $3 million contract. With incentives and playing time stipulations built into it, the deal could be worth as much as $7 million.
Dalton lives in Dallas, even though he’s played for the Bengals since 2011. The quarterback went to TCU for his collegiate career, and his family has remained in Texas throughout his professional career.
Dalton became expendable after the Bengals selected LSU’s Joe Burrow with the first overall pick in last month’s NFL Draft. Dalton, a former second-round draft pick, had one year remaining on his contract with the Bengals, and he was going to earn $17.7 million before being released.
Now, he’ll battle for the backup spot behind Dak Prescott in Dallas.
Many reports thought that Dalton might have landed with the New England Patriots or Jacksonville Jaguars.
Dalton chose to stay close to home in Texas and not move his family around during a difficult time. The coronavirus pandemic has brought about a lot of fear and uncertainty around the world, but the NFL is planning to start the regular season on time in September.
Before joining the Cowboys on Saturday, Dalton was a bit critical of his former team as they let him go two months after free agency began. The official website of the Cincinnati Bengals spoke with Dalton, who said that his late release offered fewer opportunities.
Dalton has the most experience of any quarterback on the Cowboys roster. Prescott is entering his fifth year, while Cooper Rush is in his fourth, but Rush has only attempted three passes in those four years. Clayton Thorson and rookie Ben DiNucci round out the crop of signal-callers in Dallas.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cowboys Source Has 1-Word Response To Dak Prescott Speculation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A Dallas Cowboys source had a one-word response to the speculation about Dak Prescott following Saturday night’s signing of Andy Dalton.
The Cowboys signed the former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback to a one-year contract on Saturday night. Dalton, who was released by the Bengals, will serve as Prescott’s backup.
Some, though – including former Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant – think the Dalton signing is a message for Prescott. The former Mississippi State quarterback has yet to agree to a longterm extension with the Cowboys. Prescott is currently slated to play under the franchise tag in 2020.
“Nothing against Andy Dalton because I think he’s a great player..but the cowboys are extremely out of line…” Bryant tweeted. “Pay Dak… I watched the cowboys pay Tony Twice once without a winning rec… I guess the cowboys viewing the QB position a plug in piece because of the dominant offense.”
A Cowboys source told NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero that the signing has “zero” to do with Prescott’s future.
The Cowboys have signed veteran backups several times over the years, including when Tony Romo was playing. Dallas brought in Brad Johnson, Jon Kita, Matt Cassel and Mark Sanchez, among others.
It’s fair to wonder about Prescott’s future with the Cowboys, but it doesn’t have much to do with Andy Dalton.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Veteran quarterback Andy Dalton signs 1-year deal with Dallas Cowboys</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Dallas Cowboys have yet to reach an agreement on a long-term deal with Dak Prescott, but on Saturday night they did add some insurance at the quarterback position.
Dallas signed nine-year veteran Andy Dalton to a one-year contract worth $7 million, with $3 million of it guaranteed, a person with knowledge of the situation confirmed. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to announce the move.
The Cowboys announced Dalton's signing late Saturday.
Dalton landed his next contract two days after the Cincinnati Bengals released him. Dalton had been the Bengals’ franchise quarterback ever since they drafted him in the second round of the 2011 draft.
He helped lead the team to five straight playoff appearances from 2011-15. But they had missed the postseason in each of the last four seasons.
Cincinnati went 2-14 last season and landed the first pick in this year’s draft and used that to select LSU’s Joe Burrow, which made Dalton expendable as the franchise rebuilds under second-year head coach Zac Taylor.
Dalton was expected to draw interest from several teams, and league insiders believed he could wind up in either Jacksonville or New England.
But the Katy, Texas, native and Texas Christian University product instead will return to his home state and back up Prescott for the coming year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dallas Cowboys sign QB Andy Dalton, says report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Dallas Cowboys have reportedly signed former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton.
According to ESPN's Adam Schefter, NFL franchise the Cowboys signed Dalton to a one-year deal after his Cincinnati exit.
The deal is reportedly worth a guaranteed $3million and could be worth up to $7m.
Dalton spent nine seasons with the Bengals and helped lead them to the playoffs five times before he was released on Thursday after Cincinnati drafted quarterback Joe Burrow with the top overall pick in last month's draft.
Dalton posted a 70-61-2 regular-season record as Cincinnati's starting QB, but the Bengals have not won a playoff game since 1990.
In Dallas, Dalton will serve as backup to Dak Prescott – who was given the franchise tag by the Cowboys earlier this offseason.
Dallas are still trying to come to a long-term contract agreement with Prescott.
Dalton – the Bengals' career leader in touchdown passes and a three-time Pro Bowler – already has a home in Dallas and played in college at nearby TCU.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Reports: QB Dalton joins Cowboys on one-year deal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Two days after his release from the Cincinnati Bengals, quarterback Andy Dalton agreed to sign a one-year deal with the Dallas Cowboys to back up Dak Prescott, multiple outlets reported Saturday night.
Dalton’s deal is reportedly worth up to $7 million, with $3 million guaranteed. The 32-year-old, who played in college at TCU, already has a home in Dallas and won’t need to move, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported.
He had been connected to the Jacksonville Jaguars — whose offensive coordinator, Jay Gruden, coached Dalton for two years in Cincinnati — the New York Jets and the New England Patriots.
Dalton was released Thursday after nine seasons with the Bengals, who drafted LSU’s Joe Burrow with the first overall pick last weekend. Dalton was due to earn $17.7 million in 2020, the final season of a six-year contract extension he signed in August 2014.
He told the Bengals’ website in a story published Friday that the timing of his release limited his options.
“This year there were a good amount of quarterbacks that were available,” Dalton said. “I think it would have worked out differently if I had been a free agent when the new league year started (in March). I was still under contract, and that hurt me.”
Dalton ranks first in Bengals history in touchdown passes (204) and second in passing yards (31,594). The three-time Pro Bowl selection started 133 of the Bengals’ 144 regular-season games over the past nine seasons and had a 70-61-2 record.
He threw for 3,494 yards, 16 touchdowns and 14 interceptions in 13 games last year, getting benched briefly in the middle of the season in favor of rookie Ryan Finley.
Prescott received the exclusive franchise tag from the Cowboys before he could hit free agency, giving him a one-year, $31.4 million deal. The sides have until July 15 to work out a long-term extension.

He also appeared to take a shot at Tony Romo.
Dalton will be amongst Dak Prescott, Cooper Rush, Clayton Thorson and newly-drafted Ben DiNucci as quarterbacks on the roster in Dallas.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cowboys sign Andy Dalton; veteran QB expected to back up Dak Prescott</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Cowboys on Saturday agreed to a one-year contract with free-agent quarterback Andy Dalton, the team announced.
Dalton, a Texas native who played at nearby TCU and lives in Dallas in the offseason, will receive $3 million guaranteed and can make up to $7 million overall, NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reported.

NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, citing an unnamed team source,tweeted that the Dalton signing is an insurance plan in case starter Dak Prescott goes down, not a move on from Prescott after protracted negotiations on along-term contract. The Cowboys placed their exclusive franchise tag on Prescott, which comes with a $31.4 million salary for 2020. The sides have a July 15 deadline to come to terms on a multiyear arrangement.
News of Dalton's signing comes twodays after the Bengals released their former starter after nine seasons. Cincinnati is expected to turn itsoffense over to rookie Joe Burrow, the first overall pick in this year's NFL Draft, immediately.
Last season, Dalton, 32, threw for 16 touchdowns to 14 interceptions in 13 games (seven starts).He completed 59.5 percent of his passes, the second-lowest mark of his career; only his rookie season, in 2011, was worse. He compileda career-worst 78.3 passer rating.
The Cowboys were lacking an experienced backup before adding Dalton. The team's options were Cooper Rush, Clayton Thorson and 2020 draft pick Ben DiNucci.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Andy Dalton agrees to one-year deal with the Cowboys</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Andy Dalton-to-the Patriots talk is officially dead.
The former Cincinnati Bengals quarterback agreed to a one-year deal with the Dallas Cowboys, the team announced Saturday. Dalton’s deal, which could be worth up to $7 million, has a base value of $3 million, according to ESPN.
The 32-year-old Dalton, who will be backing up Dak Prescott, already has a home in Dallas and won’t have to move, according to the report.
After Dalton was released by the Bengals on Thursday, speculation began that he could be a fit for the Patriots, who do not have an established veteran quarterback now that Tom Brady reached a two-year deal with the Buccaneers worth $50 million guaranteed, plus $9 million in incentives. Presently, second-year quarterback Jarrett Stidham tops the Patriots’ depth chart.
Dalton — who reportedly drew “legitimate interest” from the Jaguars — knew his time in Cincinnati was over once the team selected Joe Burrow with the No. 1 pick in the 2020 draft, but said the timing of his exit hurt his free-agency opportunities.
“This year there were a good amount of quarterbacks that were available,” Dalton told the Bengals’ official website on Friday. “I think it would have worked out differently if I had been a free agent when the new league year started. I was still under contract, and that hurt me.”
Dalton, who played for TCU in college, was drafted in 2011 by the Bengals with the 35th pick. The veteran signal caller led Cincinnati to four straight wild-card appearances from 2011-14, but they went 0-4 in those games.
Dalton’s career at Cincinnati bottomed out last season when he threw 14 interceptions and just 16 touchdowns in 13 games for the 2-14 Bengals. He was benched after the October trade deadline for Ryan Finley, who started three games, but Dalton regained his starting job late in the season to lead the Bengals to their two wins.
Though it’s unlikely Dalton ever will start for the Cowboys, Prescott’s long-term future in Dallas isn’t secure either. The Cowboys, who slapped Prescott, 26, with the franchise tag in March, have not yet signed the quarterback to the extension he seeks.
Prescott, along with teammate Ezekiel Elliott, was a subject of controversy during this coronavirus pandemic for holding a party or a friend that had 30 or more people in April, according to a TMZ.com report. Prescott admitted to having friends at his home in Prosper, Texas, but noted in a released statement to Pro Football Talk that less than 10 guests were in attendance.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cowboys, QB Andy Dalton reach agreement on one-year deal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Dalton is returning home.
Dalton, who was released by the Cincinnati Bengals on Thursday, agreed to a one-year deal with the Dallas Cowboys, the team announced Saturday. The quarterback's deal has a base value of $3 million and could be worth up to $7 million, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.
Before being selected by the Bengals in the second round of the 2011 NFL draft, Dalton played at TCU in Fort Worth, Texas. He lives in Dallas and will not have to move his family during an offseason that has been made uncertain by the coronavirus pandemic.
Many assumed Dalton, 32, would be in position to find a spot with a less secure starter than Dak Prescott, such as the Jacksonville Jaguars or New England Patriots, but he opted to remain close to home.
Cincinnati drafted LSU quarterback Joe Burrow with the No. 1 overall pick last week, making Dalton expendable. Dalton was set to earn $17.7 million in the final season of a six-year, $96 million contract. In nine seasons with the Bengals, Dalton had a 70-61-2 record and helped them reach the postseason in each of his first five seasons, but he was unable to win a playoff game. He holds the franchise record for touchdown passes with 204 and is second in passing yards (31,594), but he was benched after an 0-8 start to the 2019 season.
He returned to the starting spot for the final five games and recorded both of Cincinnati's victories. According to ESPN Stats & Information research, Dalton's 40.1 Total QBR in 2019 ranked 27th out of 30 qualifying quarterbacks.
The addition of Dalton does not affect the Cowboys' feelings toward Prescott, who was given the exclusive franchise tag in March at a cost of $31.4 million. The Cowboys have wanted to sign Prescott to a multiyear contract since last offseason but have not been able to come to terms on a deal that would make him one of the highest-paid -- if not the highest-paid -- quarterbacks in the NFL.
Prescott, 26, has not missed a game in his career, but the Cowboys viewed the opportunity to add Dalton as too good to pass up. Cooper Rush has served as Prescott's backup the past three seasons, but he has thrown just three passes. As a restricted free agent, Rush is set to make $2.1 million in 2020.
The Cowboys also have quarterbacks Clayton Thorson, who spent last season on the practice squad, and Ben DiNucci on the roster. The Cowboys took DiNucci in the seventh round of last week's NFL draft.
Dalton is a three-time Pro Bowler, and Prescott has made it twice in his four seasons. The only other NFL team with multiple quarterbacks who have each made multiple Pro Bowls is the Falcons; starter Matt Ryan has made four Pro Bowls, and Matt Schaub has made two. The Saints, Ravens and Bears also each have multiple quarterbacks who have made it at least once.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dalton signs with Cowboys as Dak Prescott's backup</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Dalton is coming home to Texas as Dak Prescott’s backup with the Dallas Cowboys.
Dalton and the Cowboys agreed Saturday to a one-year deal that guarantees the former Cincinnati starter $3 million and could be worth up to $7 million. The agreement was first reported by ESPN.
The Cowboys reached a deal with Dalton two days after he was released by the Bengals. That moved cleared the way for No. 1 overall draft pick Joe Burrow, who led LSU to the national championship.
Dalton, born and raised in the Houston area, led TCU to an undefeated season that included a Rose Bowl victory over Wisconsin during the 2010 season before the Bengals drafted him in the second round.
The Cowboys have relied on the untested Cooper Rush behind Prescott the past two seasons. The 32-year-old Dalton marks their biggest investment in a veteran backup since Prescott replaced the injured Tony Romo as a rookie in 2016 and ended up taking his job for good.
Dalton started 133 games for the Bengals and led the franchise’s best stretch of playoff appearances - five straight from 2011-15 - but couldn’t get that elusive win.
Cincinnati lost in the first round each time, setting an NFL record. Dalton had a broken thumb and was sidelined for the last of those playoff appearances, which ended in a last-minute meltdown and an 18-16 loss to Pittsburgh during the 2015 season.
Dalton’s 70-61-2 record as a starter is second best by a Bengals quarterback with at least 10 starts, trailing Virgil Carter. Dalton holds the club records for touchdown passes (204) and completions (2,757).
Coach Zac Taylor signaled the end of Dalton’s career in Cincinnati by benching him for three games midway through last year’s 2-14 season, a move that shocked Dalton and his longtime teammates. Dalton was upset the Bengals didn’t try to trade him before the deadline.

The Cowboys have placed the franchise tag on Prescott, who hasn’t signed the one-year tender worth about $31 million. The sides have until July 15 to get a long-term contract done.
Prescott played out his four-year rookie contract, becoming on of the NFL’s best bargains as 2016 NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and a two-time Pro Bowler. The 26-year-old’s representatives and the Cowboys have been working on a long-term deal for about a year.
After leading Dallas to the NFC’s top seed as a rookie in 2016 and losing his first playoff game to Aaron Rodgers and Green Bay, Prescott broke through with his first post-season victory two years later.
The Cowboys entered last season with high expectations and started 3-0 before fading to 8-8 and missing the playoffs. Dallas didn’t renew coach Jason Garrett’s contract and hired Mike McCarthy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ex-MLB All-Star Keough dies at 64</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former All-Star pitcher Matt Keough died Saturday of undisclosed causes. He was 64.
He had been serving as a special assistant with the Oakland Athletics, who announced his death.
Keough was a second-generation major leaguer; his father, Marty Keough, played 11 seasons in the majors from 1956-66.
The younger Keough broke in with the A’s in 1978 and earned his only All-Star selection that season. He pitched with the A’s until 1983, then went on to pitch for the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros.
“Matt was a great baseball man and a proud Oakland A,” executive vice president of baseball operations Billy Beane said in a statement. “He had an incredible passion for the game and we were lucky to have him and his wealth of knowledge alongside us for the years he worked as a special assistant. He left an unforgettable impression on everyone he touched in baseball. Our sincere condolences are with the entire Keough family tonight.””
Keough, who grew up in Southern California, finished his career with a 58-84 record and a 4.17 ERA in 215 games, 175 of them as a starter.
After his final MLB season in 1986, Keough played four seasons in Japan. The right-hander attempted a comeback with the California Angels in 1992, and while sitting in the dugout during a spring training game, he was hit in the temple by a foul ball. He required brain surgery and never played again.
To the younger generation, he is best known for his appearances on “The Real Housewives of Orange County,” which followed his life with wife, Jeana, and their three children, Shane, Kara and Colton. The show debuted in 2005, and the Keough family was prominently featured for the first five years.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">OAKLAND, Calif. — Matt Keough, the former Oakland Athletics pitcher and special assistant, has died. He was 64.
The Athletics announced the death Saturday night without providing details.
“Matt was a great baseball man and a proud Oakland A,” Billy Beane, the team’s executive vice president of baseball operations, said in a statement.
“He had an incredible passion for the game and we were lucky to have him and his wealth of knowledge alongside us for the years he worked as a special assistant. He left an unforgettable impression on everyone he touched in baseball. Our sincere condolences are with the entire Keough family tonight.”
Keough was an American League All-Star as a rookie in 1978 and was selected AL Comeback Player of the Year in 1980. He was 58-84 with a 4.17 ERA with Oakland (1977-83), the New York Yankees (1983), St. Louis (1985), Chicago Cubs (1986) and Houston (1986), then went 45-44 with a 3/73 ERA in Japan with Hanshin (1987-90).
Keough’s father, Marty and uncle, Joe, were major league outfielders.

Keough also played for the St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros during his MLB career. He also played three seasons in Japan.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former A's pitcher, 'Real Housewives' guest star Matt Keough dies at 64</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 3 (UPI) -- Matt Keough, a former All-Star pitcher with the Oakland Athletics and guest star on the reality television show Real Housewives of Orange County, died at the age of 64, the team announced Sunday.
The A's didn't disclose details on the cause of death.
"Matt was a great baseball man and a proud Oakland A," executive vice president of baseball operations Billy Beanesaid in a statement. "He had an incredible passion for the game and we were lucky to have him and his wealth of knowledge alongside us for the years he worked as a special assistant.
"He left an unforgettable impression on everyone he touched in baseball. Our sincere condolences are with the entire Keough family tonight."
Keough, who was an All-Star selection as a rookie in 1978, spent parts of seven seasons with the A's as a player, ending in 1983. He also was named the American League Comeback Player of the Year in 1980.
Across nine seasons in the majors, Keough posted a 58-84 record and 4.17 ERA in 215 career games (175 starts) with the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros and Athletics.
After retiring as a player, Keough moved on to on-field and front-office roles with the Angels, Rays and Athletics.
"The community of players is saddened by the loss of Matt Keough, who carried on his family's proud baseball legacy through more than four decades as a player, coach, scout and executive," the MLB Players Association said in a statement Sunday. "The MLBPA extends its sympathies to Matt's family, the Oakland A's organization and his many friends and fans throughout the game.
Keough later appeared on the Bravo reality show, which featured his ex-wife Jeana Keough and their children, Kara, Shane and Colton.
Real Housewives of Orange County alum Kara Keough mourned the death of her father shortly after her son died during childbirth.
"Daddy, please take care of my son. Teach him the circle changeup and how to find forever friends. You're on grandpa duty in heaven now," the 32-year-old TV personality captioned on an Instagram slide show of photos of her and her father.
Kara Keough announced two weeks ago that her son, McCoy, had died during childbirth.
She and her husband, former NFL player Kyle Bosworth, also have a 4-year-old daughter named Decker.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A former star Major League Baseball pitcher has tragically died at the age of 64.
Matt Keough, a former standout pitcher for the Oakland Athletics, reportedly died over the weekend. The American League franchise confirmed the tragic news on Saturday night.

Keough won American League Comeback Player of the Year in 1980 after going 28 consecutive starts without a victory in 1978-79.
“Matt was a great baseball man and a proud Oakland A,” A’s Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations Billy Beane said in a statement. “He had an incredible passion for the game and we were lucky to have him and his wealth of knowledge alongside us for the years he worked as a Special Assistant.

Keough later got into coaching, serving as the A’s pitching coach in the 1990s. He then worked as a scout for multiple organizations.
Our thoughts are with the Keough family during this difficult time.
May he rest in peace.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Matt Keough, Former Oakland A’s Once-Promising Ace, Dies At 64</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Matt Keough, a 1978 American League All-Star and the 1980 American League Comeback Player of the Year, died May 2, 2020. He was 64.
Keough cut his teeth with the Oakland Athletics in 1977 after being converted from an infielder to a pitcher. He played seven of his nine big league seasons with Oakland, and later worked for the team as a coach an executive from 1992-1999. The team released a statement shortly after his death acknowledging his organizational work.
"Matt was a great baseball man and a proud Oakland A," said A’s Executive Vice President of Baseball Operations Billy Beane. "He had an incredible passion for the game and we were lucky to have him and his wealth of knowledge alongside us for the years he worked as a Special Assistant. He left an unforgettable impression on everyone he touched in baseball. Our sincere condolences are with the entire Keough family tonight."
Keough was part of an overworked young staff that threw 90 complete games during 1980. Speaking with the New York Times NYT in 1999, Keough explained Billy Martin's philosophy for letting their fresh arms go the distance.
"He used to tell us don't even look at the bullpen; there won't be anyone down there," Keough said to the New York Times. "Billy's whole philosophy was, why should I bring in someone from the bullpen, lefty or righty, when they're not as good as the guys I have on the mound now?"
Eventually their workhorse staff wore down and suffered career-altering arm injuries. While many in the media pointed to Martin's carelessness, Keough thought it was not all Martin's doing; their naiveté played a role as well.
"Everybody looks at it as negative," he said, "but Billy didn't get us hurt. I don't think the complete games caused the injuries, the way we were used. ... After we got hurt, Billy convinced us to keep pitching. Our egos bought into it."
Keough found a second chance in Japan after pitching for the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros. With MLB owners colluding against free agents, a $500,000 offer in 1987 from the Hanshin Tigers swayed him to follow his father Marty's footsteps playing in a foreign country.
"We’re the first (American) father-son team to have played in Japan, and a lot of Japanese fans mention to me how they remember Dad over here," Keough said to the Los Angeles Times in 1988.
He pitched four seasons in Japan, becoming at the time, the last former MLB pitcher to win double digit games in Japan. He shared his secrets for success in Japan during a time when many American players struggled overseas.
"The key to being happy over here is to arrive with the attitude that you’re not going to be playing American baseball here," he said. "A lot of guys, they’ve come over here and fought changes, had the attitude that, 'This is how I did it in the States, and this is how I’m going to do it here.'"
One interesting tidbit Keough shared about playing in Japan was the technology teams used to get an advantage on their opponents. Note how 30 years later, the methods Keough said were used in Japan were very similar to the Houston Astros’ tactics.
“Stealing signs, strategy . . . the thinking part of the game is emphasized a lot more here,” he said. “The starting pitchers are not announced before the lineup cards are exchanged at home plate. All the clubs have video cameras and guys with binoculars in the scoreboards, the dugouts . . . all the dugouts have TV monitors.”
He tried comebacks with the California Angels in 1991 and 1992, with the latter ending in a serious injury that altered the rest of his life. While sitting in the dugout during a spring training game, he was hit in the head by a foul ball. Emergency cranial surgery saved Keough’s life, but he battled substance abuse as he coped with his brain trauma.
His problems played out publicly on the television show, “The Real Housewives of Orange County” where his wife Jeana was a featured star. Speaking with People Magazine in 2019, his estranged wife explained how his injury splintered their relationship.
“The minute he got injured in 1992, he was not the same person. From 1992, he woke up, he didn’t like me,” she said. “I’m kind of not what he wants. He needs peace and quiet and I had a house full of crazy kids and their friends … and he’s been alone for a long time. He prefers the company of himself.”
Keough was sentenced in 2010 to one year in jail for drunk driving. He is survived by his three children, Shane, Kara and Colton. His eldest child Shane played four minor league seasons with the A’s.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Charlatan, Nadal give Bob Baffert wins at Arkansas Derby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HOT SPRINGS, Ark. -- Charlatan romped to victory by six lengths in the first division of the Arkansas Derby, and Nadal won the second division, giving Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert a sweep on Saturday when the Kentucky Derby was postponed.
The 146th Kentucky Derby usually would have dominated the first Saturday in May, but it was pushed back to Sept. 5 by the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, 18 3-year-olds ran in two divisions of the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn, each worth $500,000. Each race was worth 170 qualifying points for the Kentucky Derby, including 100 to the winners. It was the first time since 1960 that the race was split.
No fans were allowed because of the pandemic on a day that would have been the biggest of the season at Oaklawn.
Charlatan improved to 3-0 after not racing at age 2. (His first two wins by a combined 16 lengths came at California's Santa Anita Park, where the colt is based.) He broke from the No. 1 post in the 1 1/8-mile race under Martin Garcia, who was replacing Drayden Van Dyke for the race. Charlatan was timed in 1:48.49 and paid $2.80 to win.
"He did it all within himself," Garcia said. "I felt someone coming at the three-eighths [pole], and I let him go. He just took off. That's a sign of a really good horse."
Basin finished second, and Gouverneur Morris was another neck back in third. Winning Impression finished fourth.
Nadal, named for tennis star Rafael Nadal, won his division in 1:48.34. He is 4-0 in his young career.
"He looked good, very good race," winning jockey Joel Rosario said. "He's a champ."
King Guillermo, owned by former major league catcher Victor Martinez, a five-time All-Star, finished second. Finnick the Fierce, a 60-1 shot, was third.
It was Baffert's third win in the Arkansas Derby.
"I thought both horses were going to run really well," Baffert said. "Charlatan, what a talent he is and how fast he is. Nadal, he's a tough horse. There's a lot to him and he's a cool customer, and I could see he's getting better and better."
The race was supposed to be on April 11, but Oaklawn reworked its stakes schedule to run it on closing day Saturday and split it into divisions because of the large number of horses that were entered.
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Charlatan, Nadal give Bob Baffert sweep in Arkansas Derby | Honolulu Star-Advertiser</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HOT SPRINGS, Ark. >> Charlatan romped to victory by six lengths in the first division of the Arkansas Derby and Nadal won the second division by three lengths, giving Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert a sweep today when the Kentucky Derby was postponed.
The 146th Derby usually would have dominated the first Saturday in May, but it was pushed back to Sept. 5 by the coronavirus pandemic. Instead, 20 3-year-olds ran in two divisions of the Arkansas Derby at Oaklawn, each worth $500,000. Each race was worth 170 qualifying points for the Kentucky Derby, including 100 to the winners. It was the first time since 1960 that the race was split.
No fans were allowed because of the pandemic on a day that would have been the biggest of the season at Oaklawn.
Charlatan improved to 3-0 after not racing at age 2. His first two wins by a combined 16 lengths came at Santa Anita, where the colt is based. He broke from the No. 1 post in the 1 1/8-mile race under Martin Garcia, who was replacing Drayden Van Dyke for the race. Charlatan was timed in 1:48.49 and paid $2.80 to win.
“He did in all within himself,” Garcia said. “I felt someone coming at the three-eighths (pole) and I let him go. He just took off. That’s a sign of a really good horse.”
Basin finished second and Gouverneur Morris was another neck back in third. Winning Impression finished fourth.
Nadal, named for tennis star Rafael Nadal, won his division in 1:48.34. He paid $3.80 to win. He is 4-0 in his young career and moved to the top of the Kentucky Derby leaderboard with 150 points.
“He looked good; very good race,” winning jockey Joel Rosario said. “He’s a champ.”
King Guillermo, owned by former major league catcher Victor Martinez, finished second. Finnick the Fierce, a 60-1 shot, was third.
It was Baffert’s third win in the Arkansas Derby.
“I thought both horses were going to run really well,” Baffert said. “Charlatan, what a talent he is and how fast he is. Nadal, he’s a tough horse. There’s a lot to him and he’s a cool customer, and I could see he’s getting better and better.”
The race was supposed to be on April 11, but Oaklawn reworked its stakes schedule to run it on closing day today and split it into divisions because of the large number of horses that were entered.

Charlatan earns victory in Arkansas Derby 1st division

Secretariat wins virtual Kentucky Derby's Triple Crown Showdown
Forty-seven years after his record-setting Kentucky Derby triumph, Secretariat once again ruled the first Saturday in May — virtually speaking at least.
In a computer-generated matchup of all 13 Triple Crown winners put together by Inspired Entertainment, Secretariat rallied five-wide and beat Citation by a half-length to capture the Kentucky Derby Triple Crown Showdown.
The virtual race was broadcast as part of NBC’s Kentucky Derby coverage on a day when there was no Kentucky Derby. The race has been postponed until Sept. 5 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Seattle Slew led the way heading for home before Secretariat — the 7-2 favorite — and jockey Ron Turcotte made their move down the middle of the track. Citation (1948 Triple Crown winner) and jockey Eddie Arcaro shot down the rail but couldn’t match Secretariat.
Seattle Slew was third and was followed by Affirmed, American Pharoah, Whirlaway, Justify, Count Fleet, Assault, War Admiral, Omaha, Gallant Fox and Sir Barton.
The Virginia-bred Secretariat won the 1973 Kentucky Derby in a time of 1:59 2/5 seconds, a record that still stands today.
MLB
Marlins manager Mattingly reveals truth behind birthday mystery
Fact: Don Mattingly was born on April 20, 1961. So why, for so long, did baseball writers and fans believe his birthday to be April 20, 1962? Sure, some of his baseball cards said as much — the 1987 Topps edition actually went so far as to say the '61 birth date was incorrect.
ESPN ran a lengthy story this week examining how the 1962 date of birth became printed and accepted. But on Friday, Mattingly offered his version of how the age change came to be.
"I think I'm 21 or something, and the writers in New York, they're always around," Mattingly began in a video from a Q&A session for his charity that was posted online. "And they're like, 'Oh, you're going to be 22.' And I'm like, 'No, I'm going to be 21. Dude, I'm 20, I'm gonna be 21.' So you know you always want to get younger, right?"
The reporters challenged Mattingly to provide proof. So he photocopied his original certificate, whited out "61" and wrote "62" over it, photocopied that copy, and then showed it to the media.
COLLEGE FOOTBALL
Kansas, Missouri renew Border War
Kansas and Missouri are resuming their bitter Border War in football after the former Big 12 rivals agreed to a four-game series in which each school will play two home games beginning in September 2025.
The fourth-longest rivalry in college football dates to 1891, but it has been on hiatus since Missouri departed for the Southeastern Conference. The schools recently announced a six-game series in men's basketball beginning with the upcoming season that includes two games on each campus and two in Kansas City, Missouri.
The second football game between the Jayhawks and Tigers will take place in 2026 in Lawrence. The third will happen in Columbia in 2031 before the series concludes the following season in Lawrence.
Missouri leads the series 56-55-9 after winning the most recent matchup at Arrowhead Stadium on Nov. 25, 2011.
SOCCER
Joe Biden tells USWNT to keep fighting for equal pay
After a federal judge in California on Friday threw out the U.S. women's national soccer team's claim of unequal pay compared to the men's team, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden tweeted his support of the women.
"Don't give up this fight," read a tweet posted on Biden's official account on Saturday. "This is not over yet."
The former vice president also called out U.S. Soccer and laid out in plain terms what the consequences would be if the organization did not pony up for equal pay.
"Equal pay, now," Biden tweeted. "Or else when I'm president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding."
Friday's ruling, made in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California by Judge R. Gary Klausner, ruled that a discrimination claim related to unequal working conditions — specifically, the use of charter flights — may proceed to trial.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League 'offered chance' to complete season in Australia amid coronavirus crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Premier League has reportedly been offered the chance to complete the season - by hosting the remaining 92 games in Perth, Australia.
June 12 is the new target date for resuming top-flight action after the campaign was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic.
But the league is facing a potential revolt from players who are concerned about the risk of being infected with Covid-19 and fear they could be rushed back too soon.
Premier League bosses have now been offered an alternative, however, with English agent Gary Williams proposing the rest of the campaign be staged in Perth.
Williams lives in the Western Australia capital, and according to the Sun, he has been in talks with Premier League clubs and government officials about holding all remaining fixtures in the city.
Australia has reported 93 deaths due to coronavirus, compared to more than 28,000 in the UK.
Williams said: “I have had discussions with contacts at Premier League clubs and they like the idea.
“I have also spoken with government officials and they are enthusiastic. We are speaking again this week.
“Everybody is safe here. The government has lifted many restrictions.
"We are sitting round in groups of ten, we can walk around and the beaches are open. We have had four new cases in the last ten days.”
Perth, which claims to be 'the most isolated city in the world' has four major sporting venues that could be used - the Optus Stadium (65,000 capacity), the Perth Oval (20,500), the WACA cricket ground (24,500) and Joondalup Arena (16,000).
And Williams' plan has been backed by Perth state senator Glenn Sterle, who said: “I’m watching what’s happening in England with a heavy heart. We want to help.”
“We have almost no new cases. It would just be a case of some quarantine for our friends when they arrive and then we are up and running.

“When Gary first mentioned it I thought it was a wonderful idea.
“I’m glad he is getting the same response from the people in the game he has called.
“This is the centre of the sporting universe in Australia. We have fresh air and good weather. It would be ideal.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Premier League season could finish in Perth – Williams</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Perth could host the remaining matches of the coronavirus-hit 2019-20 Premier League season under an audacious plan, according to agent Gary Williams.
The Premier League has been postponed since March due to the COVID-19 crisis and it remains to be seen when, and if, the campaign will resume.
Amid speculation and concerns, the Premier League reconfirmed the commitment of its clubs to restart the season when it is safe to do so – a plan to play games behind closed doors and potentially at a neutral venue has been reported.
While the United Kingdom struggles to contain the virus, which has killed at least 28,100 people in the country, the Australian city of Perth has emerged as a shock location to kickstart the interrupted campaign.
Australia has seen less than 7,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and at least 93 casualties as Williams – who is based in Perth – sensationally plots to bring Premier League fixtures to Optus Stadium and the WACA Ground.
Optus Stadium played host to Manchester United during their pre-season trip ahead of the 2019-20 campaign, while Chelsea also travelled to Perth in 2018.
"We've got the venues, we've got the weather and we are in control of the coronavirus at the moment," Williams told ABC Grandstand on Sunday.
"You would need four facilities and the timing is absolutely brilliant, because we could kick off over here at 6pm, 8pm and 10pm.
"And 10pm kick off here would be 3pm in the afternoon there and we'd also have coverage worldwide all through Asia and America.
"Timing wise this is the ideal place and also health and safety wise and facility wise, it's the ideal place, Perth."
Williams added: "The players would have to be in isolation for two weeks [travelling to Australia from the UK].
"After the two weeks, all the games would be televised with no crowds.
"We'd be looking at Optus [Stadium], the WACA and probably [HBF] Arena. They could use local state league clubs to do the training."
Liverpool were 25 points clear atop the table through 29 games when the Premier League was suspended.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Everything Nottingham Forest fans should know about latest Premier League and EFL update</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The EFL have once again reaffirmed their stance that they are aiming to complete the 2019/20 season when it is deemed safe to do so.
Chairman Rick Parry has insisted that the EFL remain determined to finish the season in an open letter to all 71 clubs yesterday.
All professional football in England has been indefinitely suspended since March 13 and there is no concrete date as to when it will return.
But with so many contrasting statements, it's often hard to remember what the latest news on a return to action for Nottingham Forest really is.
So we have put together this handy guide of all the latest that has been said about a return to action...
"Whilst there is still no further clarity on a return of EFL matches, the objective remains to play the remaining fixtures for the 2019-20 campaign at the current 71 EFL grounds.
“It is important that any clubs notify the EFL of any issues that may prevent this as soon as possible.
"Some progress has been made in respect of planning how matches may take place, with draft operational plans put before the board at this week's meeting and incorporating many areas such as: stadium preparation, medical provisions, staffing, media access and, of course, measures needed to ensure the safety of all participants including first-team players and staff, match officials, and everyone else associated with the matchday environment."
It is not yet known when the EFL and its club are set to meet again, however given the Premier League is due to meet next Friday, one imagines an update from the governing body will be issued next week.
While the government is also expected to issue a statement on lockdown measures next Thursday.
Should lockdown measures be loosened, it will offer encouragement that clubs can return to training in mid-May ahead of a June 8 restart.
Of course, if current measures remain, that would seriously dent any hopes of restarting on that date.
According to the Guardian, the EFL have put a contingency plan in place if the 2019/20 Championship season isn't completed.
The plan will see Leeds United and West Brom promoted with the play-offs used to decide the final spot.
Leeds and West Brom have a clear advantage in the automatic promotion places, making it relatively straightforward to award them a place in the Premier League if the season can't be completed.
However, with only four points between Fulham, Nottingham Forest and Brentford who make up third to fifth spot, the EFL plans to play out the usual play-off lottery to determine the third promoted team, report the Guardian.
The Championship intends to complete the season but as its clubs wait to be informed on how protocols for behind-closed-doors matches would work, the EFL have set out a plan of action for a worst-case scenario.
While in the Mail, they claim Championship clubs are set to discuss introducing a salary cap from next season.
The cap would limit any new contract to £7,000 per week and would see clubs attempting to renegotiate existing deals.
The number would be a big drop for many clubs with the average highest earner across all Championship clubs earning £29,000 per week.
Currently, the highest-paid player in the second tier earns a whopping £68,000 per week.
The average lowest-paid player earns £8,500, which puts into perspective the level of the cut being discussed.
The measures wouldn't end there, either, with proposals for each squad to be limited to 24 with a certain number of 23-and-unders.
According to the report, the EFL also wants the next transfer window to remain open until the end of March to allow clubs to rebalance their books.
"It's common sense," one EFL club official told SportsMail. "Extending the window would allow us flexibility as we try to keep afloat."
Beyond the Championship, it is being reported that players are being told the chances of resuming the current season are 'receding'.
Across all leagues, it is unlikely fans will return to stadiums until at least January.
The EFL declined to comment when asked about the story, but clubs are set to meet today to discuss plans both for the current season and the future.
Bradford City have dropped a huge hint that next season will commence behind closed doors.
The League Two side have this afternoon suspended all season-ticket sales as they await further information regarding a conclusion to the current campaign.
“'City For All' 2020/21 season-ticket sales have today been suspended,” a statement on the club’s website read.
“The decision has been taken as the club continues to await further information regarding a conclusion to the current campaign, with the start date for next season yet to be confirmed.
“This comes following a meeting yesterday held between the EFL and the Bantams' Sky Bet League Two colleagues.
“City officials have recently been informed of the ever-growing possibility of supporters being unable to attend matches until 2021.
“And it is now highly likely that next season will commence behind closed doors.
“Should this be the case, the club will endeavour to ensure those who have already purchased season tickets for the coming campaign will be able to view matches - FREE of charge - from home via iFollow.
“If this is not preferred then refunds will become available at a later date.
“The club will move to update supporters on this matter as soon as possible, with talks to continue over the coming weeks between the relevant governing bodies."
While the EFL have also confirmed that all academy matches for the 2019/20 season have been cancelled.
The decision has been made that all Under-23, Under-18 and other competitions will not take place as the sole focus remains on completing first-team matches.
An EFL statement on Friday read: "The EFL has today confirmed that the Academy Games Programme for the 2019/20 season has been terminated with immediate effect.
"The EFL administers the programme for Category 3 and 4 Clubs (U9 to U18) whilst the Premier League does so for Category 1 and 2 Clubs (U9 to U23) and the decision, which is independent of any discussions regarding the resumption of the 2019/20 campaign for first-team football, has been taken to give Academy staff and their players an element of clarity at this challenging time.
"The methodology for determining the final League standings or other outcomes for the season will be decided at a future date. Additionally, it is intended that any fixtures for the 2020/21 Academy season will not commence any earlier than would usually be expected.
"In addition, several other games programmes have been affected.”
Those competitions affected are the Central League, the Community & Education Football Alliance (CEFA) and the Kids Cup.
“At a meeting of Premier League Shareholders today, clubs discussed possible steps towards planning to resume the 2019/20 season, when it is safe and appropriate to do so,” a Premier League statement said.
“It was reiterated that the thoughts of all are with those directly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Furthermore, the Premier League’s priority is the health and safety of players, coaches, managers, club staff, supporters and the wider community.
“The League and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with Government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers.
“The League welcomed the creation of the Government medical working group for a return of elite sport, which met for the first time this morning.
“No decisions were taken at today’s Shareholders’ meeting and clubs exchanged views on the information provided regarding "Project Restart".
“It was agreed that the PFA, LMA, players and managers are key to this process and will be further consulted.
“The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019/20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the Government’s support.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Proposal to finish PL season in Australia!</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Agent Gary Williams has proposed to the Premier League clubs the possibility of playing the rest of the season in Perth, Australia, a city with less COVID-19 infections than the UK.
The Premier League could end the 2019-20 season outside of England to prevent millionaire losses. 'The Sun' assures that agent Gary Williams has proposed playing the rest of the season in Perth. 
Williams has met with the Premier League clubs and, according to this words, the proposal has been met positively. "I've had conversations with the clubs and they like the idea," the cited media outlet said.
"I have also spoken with members of the government and they are positive. We are talking again this week," the agent, who is currently living in Perth, said.

The agent says that they hardly have new cases of COVID-19 and that it is "the most isolated city in the world." The Australian city also has four stadia with more than 16,000 seats although the games would be behind closed doors.
Williams says he will put on 20 different planes to Western Perth, one for each team. The clubs will each have their own hotel and they will quarantine for 14 days on arrival. 
Four stadia will be used including the new Optus Stadium, the WACA and the Joondalip Arena.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What Cardiff City, Swansea City, Leeds United and West Brom will have learned from Rick Parry’s open letter to EFL clubs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The EFL have once again reaffirmed their stance that they are aiming to complete the 2019/20 season when it is deemed safe to do so.
Chairman Ricky Parry has insisted that the EFL remain determined to finish the season in an open letter to all 71 clubs.
All professional football in England has been indefinitely suspended since March 13 and there is no concrete date as to when it will return.
Reports earlier this week had suggested there was a growing feeling that the EFL season was unlikely to be completed, while a leaked message from Bristol Rovers' PFA representative Alex Rodman suggested plans to promote three teams from each level of the EFL, with no relegation, were now gathering pace.
However, it seems that football chiefs remain keen on ensuring that the season is allowed to be completed.
Like the rest of the EFL, Cardiff City and Swansea City would have ended their regular seasons this weekend, and were both firmly in the running for a top six finish.
Failure to complete the season would, in all likelihood, end any possible hope of either side earning a place in the top flight next season.
However, this latest assurance will come as a significant boost to their respective ambitions, although clearly there is still plenty of uncertainty over the situation.
What did Parry say?
"Whilst there is still no further clarity on a return of EFL matches, the objective remains to play the remaining fixtures for the 2019-20 campaign at the current 71 EFL grounds.
“It is important that any clubs notify the EFL of any issues that may prevent this as soon as possible.

When will they next meet?

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Progress' - EFL reveal Championship development as Birmingham City set return date</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chairman Rick Parry has insisted that the EFL remain determined to finish the season in an open letter to all 71 clubs.
All professional matches in England have been suspended since mid-March and talks continue over when or whether the season will resume.
Both France and the Netherlands have cancelled the remaining matches in their top-flight but Parry insists the EFL will not follow suit and remain in constant dialogue with the government.
An open letter read: “Whilst there is still no further clarity on a return of EFL matches, the objective remains to play the remaining fixtures for the 2019-20 campaign at the current 71 EFL grounds.
"It is important that any clubs notify the EFL of any issues that may prevent this as soon as possible.

The Premier League remain in talks over ‘Project Restart’ with a date of June 8 targeted for a potential return to action.
Blues are currently 16th in the table, eight points off the bottom three - and nine off the play-offs.
Pep Clotet has revealed Birmingham City’s training plans in the event their Championship season can be resumed.
The EFL have sent an open letter to their clubs this week restating their desire to complete the current campaign.
Chief executive Rick Parry told clubs: “Whilst there is still no further clarity on a return of EFL matches, the objective remains to play the remaining fixtures for the 2019-20 campaign at the current 71 EFL grounds.”
And with that still the aim Blues have laid out their roadmap for a return to training.
“We are following the government guidelines and we have prepared it so that the players can have individual, optional work if they want to go to the training ground on their own. They have received that on the phone and video,” Clotet told the club's YouTube channel.
“They can do that from next week.
“Based on the information we have at the minute the plan that we have is so that we can start training the week after – mid-May
“But of course a lot of things need to happen, we need to know what are the plans of all the clubs and EFL to make sure the environments are safe, if it is going to be tested or not tested.
“There are some many things in the air but we are planning to try to be on the pitch on May 18. Some testing before - then on the 18 we can start training."
Ben Foster has revealed the bizarre one-word team talk Carson Yeung gave Birmingham City's players as they fought relegation in 2011.
Alex McLeish's side defeated Arsenal in the League Cup final at Wembley before being relegated from the Premier League to cap a turbulent season.
McLeish would later quit the club for arch-rivals Aston Villa and Yeung's tenure as owner began to unravel.
He was eventually imprisoned for money laundering and sold the club to current owners Trillion Trophy Asia in October 2016.
And Foster, who spent just one season at St Andrew's after joining from Manchester United, has detailed a bizarre meeting with Yeung towards the end of the 2010/11 campaign.
Speaking to The Peter Crouch Podcast, Foster said: "That was the season we won the League Cup against Arsenal. That was one of my best moments in football, it was great.
"We had Carson Yeung - do you remember that guy? He only ever came into the stadium a few times to see the lads, but his English was zero, he couldn't say a thing, honestly.
"It was about two or three games before the end of the season and we're in trouble and facing relegation.
"And they've gone, 'The owner wants to come in and say a few words before the match to boost morale'.
"Anyway, he walks in and you can see he's nervous. It's all quiet and it's so weird. He doesn't say anything and everyone is thinking, 'What is going on?'
"And eventually he just blurts out 'Win!' - and that's all he said. 'Win', and then he just stops and walks out.
"That was genuinely all he could muster, 'Win'."
There are themes which run through Jonathan Spector’s career in English football, like writing through a stick of Blackpool rock.
So often the affable American found himself stuck between that rock and a hard place, with relegation battles, injury struggles and managerial changes making sure life was never straight forward.
Whether it was in the Claret of West Ham, or the Blue of Birmingham City, the defender ducked and dived the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune for more than a decade.
He amassed more than 300 Football League appearances, mounted two European campaigns and dodged the drop on a couple of occasions before returning to his homeland for a quieter life.
It is one that finds now finds him as the Head of International Player recruitment at Atlanta United and a 34-year-old for whom the upheaval of Upton Park and St Andrew’s must seem to belong to a different lifetime.
Upheaval was the one constant.
“I feel my time in England, the five years at West Ham and five-and-a-half at Birmingham there was always some sort of existential crisis or something in the club that became an issue,” he told BirminghamLive.
Coincidentally Spector made his debuts for both the Hammers and Blues in European competition. He also worked under Gianfranco Zola at both clubs.
His West Ham bow came when Alan Pardew’s team lost 3-0 to Palermo in the UEFA Cup in August 2006.
For Blues it was five years later as part of Chris Hughton’s Europa League adventurers in a 0-0 draw with Nacional on the island of Madeira.
If the game didn’t live long in the memory, the journey to an imposing cliff-face citadel certainly did.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What EFL plans mean for Pride Park and latest on centre-back's transfer to Derby County</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Derby County are still on course to play their remaining Championship games with EFL chairman Rick Parry writing an open letter to all 71 clubs insisting there is a determination to finish the season.
All professional matches in England have been suspended since mid-March and talks continue over when or whether the season will resume, with Derby sat 12th, five points off the play-off spots, with nine games to play.
Both France and the Netherlands have cancelled the remaining matches in their top flight but Parry insists the EFL will not follow suit and remain in constant dialogue with the government.
He also appeared to rule out the notion of neutral venues for fixtures, an idea that has been mooted in the Premier League.
An open letter read: "Whilst there is still no further clarity on a return of EFL matches, the objective remains to play the remaining fixtures for the 2019-20 campaign at the current 71 EFL grounds. It is important that any clubs notify the EFL of any issues that may prevent this as soon as possible."

Mike Te Wierik will join Derby County as planned this summer despite the crisis in football due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The COVID-19 outbreak has halted the game around the world and it remains unclear when football will restart.
Te Wierik has signed a pre-contract agreement to link up with the Rams on a free transfer from Dutch club Groningen this summer.
The Eredivisie season was cancelled last week with no promotion or relegation and no champions.
Ajax led the table from AZ Alkmaar on goal difference with nine games left but will not be named champions.

Derby County are ready to go with their training plans should the Government say it is safe for football to do so.
The Championship campaign is currently suspended indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Rams ' last match was the 3-0 victory over Blackburn Rovers on March 8, almost two months ago.
The EFL’s training resumption is pencilled in for May 16, but that very much depends on being given the green light and the Government easing lockdown restrictions on May 7.
Derby's players have been training at home, but the club has been putting together contingency plans for when a return to the Moor Farm training complex is possible.

Derby County Under-23s will not get a shot at silverware after the Premier League cancelled all youth football.
The young Rams had made it through to the quarter-finals of the Premier League Cup after a 6-0 demolition of Middlesbrough in March, but they will not get to see the campaign through following a “unanimous” decision on Friday.
The cancellation of academy football also sees Derby Under-23s’ Premier League 2 campaign ended. For a good portion of the season, they had looked like title contenders, but a run of five games without a win saw them slip to fourth with four games to play, 11 points behind leaders Chelsea.
No decision has yet been made on how the final standings will be determined, and whether a title will be awarded and relegation enforced, but if the Premier League choose to take the points-per-game route, Derby will finish fifth.
The Premier League’s decision also sees the Under-18s’ Premier League North campaign ended. Retaining the title was all-but off the cards for the Under-18s, who, like the Under-23s, could drop from fourth to fifth if the season is decided by points per game.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Veteran forward Kelly Babstock signs with NWHL's Toronto expansion team</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TORONTO — Kelly Babstock is ready to have her name written in hockey's history books.
Babstock, from Mississauga, Ont., signed with the new Toronto franchise of the National Women's Hockey League on Saturday. Toronto's new team was announced on April 22, and is the first Canadian city to have a club in the American NWHL.
"It's a super exciting situation to be in, being a part of the inaugural Toronto NWHL team," said Babstock. "It's making history, and there's nothing better than being a part of the history books, being a part of something bigger than yourself."
The 27-year-old Babstock played in the first four seasons of the NWHL, the first three as a member of the Connecticut Whale and the 2018-19 season with the Buffalo Beauts.
She has 27 goals and 33 assists in 65 games, appearing in NWHL all-star game in 2017 and 2018.
Five other players were named to Toronto's roster when the as-yet unnamed franchise was unveiled April 22, including forwards Shiann Darkangelo and Taylor Woods, defenders Emma Greco and Kristen Barbara, and goaltender Elaine Chuli.
Babstock says she's happy to once again play with Darkangelo and Greco, who were her teammates on the Whale.
"It's going to be super exciting to reunite with those girls again, and I'm excited to see what the future roster holds," said Babstock.
Babstock, Chuli, Greco, Darkangelo and Woods were all members of the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association.
The PWHPA had balked at competing for either the NWHL or Canadian Women's Hockey League last season, instead pushing for the establishment of a single league capable of paying players a fair wage and with a financially stable long-term economic model.
The CWHL folded at the end of last season, but members of the PWHPA continue to hold out, staging their own exhibition series until it was put on hold by the COVID-19 pandemic.
"Our mission as the PWHPA has not changed and we are still moving forward with next season — in full force," said the PWHPA in a statement when the Toronto expansion was announced. "Simply put, the opportunities that the NWHL will provide may be good for some players, but it's not the opportunities that we want for our players or for future generations of young girls who will play the game at the highest level."
For her part, Babstock hopes the labour impasse comes to an end and she's looking forward to getting back on the ice.
"The PWHPA and the NWHL are unfortunately divided," said Babstock. "I don't know why that is. I'm still wondering about that."
The NWHL was founded in 2015, becoming North America's first pro women's hockey league to pay its players a salary. It currently has teams in Boston, Monmouth Junction, N.J., Danbury, Conn., Buffalo, N.Y., and Saint Paul, Minn.
Babstock lives and works in Connecticut as a hockey coach and will fly to and from Toronto for games and practices. When the Toronto team visits Boston, Monmouth Junction, or Danbury she'll just drive from home to those games.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cologne calls worried Verstaete to account</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN — Cologne has called midfielder Birger Verstraete to account for an interview he gave in which he criticized the club for its handing of three positive cases of the coronavirus.
The Bundesliga side said Sunday that Verstraete had given a false impression about training safety measures at the club in an interview Saturday with Belgian TV station VTM. It said it was abiding by the league’s medical advice and that all players would be tested again before training can resume Monday.
In a statement on the club website, Verstraete said, “Instead of giving an interview out of emotion, I should have contacted our doctor and had my questions answered. It was not my intention to blame the responsible authorities or FC Cologne.”
Verstraete had told VTM in an interview Saturday that two players and a physiotherapist were confirmed with COVID-19 and that he was finding it hard to focus on soccer, especially as his girlfriend is at high risk due to a previous heart condition.
“I want everyone to be healthy before we play soccer again,” Verstraete said.
The players had been training in small groups, but that hadn’t eased Verstraete’s concerns.
“We train in two groups and you know that the boys were extremely close to me,” Verstraete told VTM. “The test was done on Thursday around 4 p.m. and before that we had been together constantly from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. We did fitness work together, trained together. Thursday’s test didn’t show that I am positive and that is why there will be another test tomorrow.”
The three affected individuals were immediately ordered to quarantine for 14 days, but otherwise training was to continue as before.
Team doctor Paul Klein defended the club’s handling of the cases on Saturday, saying training with those who tested negative was still possible “due to the hygiene and infection prevention measures in group training” as no one had come into prolonged contact with those affected.
But Verstraete said the decision not to quarantine the whole squad “is a bit bizarre.”
Verstraete said the club was correct “in a literal sense. But the physiotherapist is the man who treated me and other players for weeks. And I paired up with one of the two players in the gym on Thursday. So to say we did not come into contact with them is not entirely correct.”
Players and staff around the Bundesliga began giving samples Thursday as part of an ongoing process targeting a return to full training, then to games later this month.
“It’s not up to me to decide what to do with the Bundesliga but I can say that my head is not on soccer. If you see how close (the virus) is,” Verstraete said. “The health of my family, girlfriend – everyone in fact – is paramount.”
On Sunday, Verstraete told Cologne’s website that his girlfriend “will head home to Belgium and stay there for the time being.”
Most teams have not commented on test results. Werder Bremen, Bayer Leverkusen, Eintracht Frankfurt, Hoffenheim Hertha Berlin and Union Berlin all reported negative results before another round of testing Sunday.
Second-division side Stuttgart reported an “inconclusive result” from a person, reportedly a player, who was separated from his colleagues and placed in quarantine for 14 days before another test on Monday.
A Paderborn player tested positive in March.
On Thursday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and 16 state governors postponed a decision on whether the Bundesliga could resume without fans present until next Wednesday. She warned there was still a danger that COVID-19 infections could rise if containment measures were relaxed too soon.
German clubs had committed to finishing the season by the end of June.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: 'Bizarre' Cologne still training after positive COVID-19 tests – Verstraete</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cologne midfielder Birger Verstraete said it is "bizarre" that the Bundesliga side are still training after three positive tests for coronavirus.
On Friday, Cologne announced three unspecified people at the club contracted COVID-19 amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has brought the Bundesliga and sport to a standstill globally.
The trio – which reportedly consists of two players and a physio – were consequently told to undergo a 14-day quarantine procedure.
Cologne will continue with their training programme, with a decision on the potential resumption of the Bundesliga set to be made on May 6.
But Belgian Verstraete is concerned, telling VTM: "What the club communicated, that nobody has come into contact with the players is correct, in the literal sense of the word, that is.
"But the physiotherapist is the man who treated me and other players for weeks. And I formed a duo in the gym on Thursday with one of the two players in question. So to say we did not come into contact with them at all is not entirely correct.
"I hope it stays with three people, but I also keep in mind that the virus has spread."
Verstraete, 26, added: "We aren't quarantined for the time being, and that's a bit bizarre.
"At the moment football is not the most important place for me, especially because it is getting so close now. I had previously seen images of intensive care. And now it appears that the virus is also close to us. So it's bit strange that everything just keeps going."
Germany's top two divisions were suspended on March 13, with Cologne 10th in the Bundesliga – five points adrift of Schalke in the last European qualification spot.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cologne calls worried player to account over virus comments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN (AP) - Cologne has called midfielder Birger Verstraete to account for an interview he gave in which he criticized the club for its handing of three positive cases of the coronavirus.
The Bundesliga side said Sunday that Verstraete had given a false impression about training safety measures at the club in an interview Saturday with Belgian TV station VTM. It said it was abiding by the league’s medical advice and that all players would be tested again before training can resume Monday.
In a statement on the club website, Verstraete said, “Instead of giving an interview out of emotion, I should have contacted our doctor and had my questions answered. It was not my intention to blame the responsible authorities or FC Cologne.”
Verstraete had told VTM in an interview Saturday that two players and a physiotherapist were confirmed with COVID-19 and that he was finding it hard to focus on soccer, especially as his girlfriend is at high risk due to a previous heart condition.
“I want everyone to be healthy before we play soccer again,” Verstraete said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bundesliga players not happy with how positive corona cases are being dealt with</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Birger Verstraete, the Cologne midfielder, expressed his opinion on the decision made by the club and the authorities to not quarantien the whole of the Cologne sqaud aftert three players tested positive for coronavirus.
Just when the Bundesliga seemed ready to return, three Cologne players tested positivefor coronavirus on Friday, leaving the competition's return up in the air. 
Birger Verstraete, the Belgian player for the German club, criticised the way the situation has been dealt with after his teammates tested positive.
"The physio is the man who treated me and other players for weeks. And I worked together with one of the two players who tested positive in the gym last Thursday," he told 'VTM'.

Verstraete believes the whole squad should have been made to self-isolate after the players tested positive, His partner has heart problems so it could cause major problems if she picked it up. The Belgian believes resuming the league very shortly is not realistic. 
"The players would say 'first health, then football' if they were allowed their opinion on the matter," the Cologne footballer continued.
The decision to isolate just those who have tested positive is part of the protocol agreed by the German league (DFL), the FA (DFB) and the health authorities. The squad will have more tests on Monday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">McLaughlin does a 'Bradbury' for 2nd virtual IndyCar win</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scott McLaughlin was supposed to leave Australia for Indianapolis this month to make his IndyCar debut on the road course at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
With sports on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic, the two-time SuperCars champion saw his IndyCar plans postponed.
Pole-sitter McLaughlin instead settled for a virtual victory on Saturday on the oval at Indianapolis Motor Speedway after a wild finish in which most of the leaders crashed as they rushed toward the chequered flag.
"Unbelievable," McLaughlin said.
"I was literally just hoping there was going to be a wreck at the end.
"I thought we were going to be third, and then the three wrecked and we won."
It was his second win of IndyCar's iRacing six-race series.
McLaughlin celebrated in the seat of his simulator in Australia with a glass of cold milk, a nod to the traditional victory celebration at the Indianapolis 500.
The New Zealander declined to pour it over his head while sitting in his expensive rig.
Australian Will Power was 12th and finished second in the overall standings after the six races, behind McLaughlin.
Formula One driver Lando Norris, winner of last week's IndyCar virtual race, was headed for what appeared a 1-2-3 podium sweep for the Arrow McLaren SP entries on the final lap.
But Norris ran into the back of Simon Pagenaud in what appeared to be a deliberate from the Frenchman, a two-time iRacing winner and the defending Indy 500 champion, to take both out of contention.
"Cause a guy get's a bit salty that a non-IndyCar driver is about to win an indy race... just ruins it," Norris said.
Marcus Ericsson held the lead before being tagged by Pato O'Ward at the final corner before Oliver Askew and Santino Ferrucci crashed in a drag race to the line.
"That was wild! Did my best "Bradbury" and won the Indy 175! Thanks to Pirtek for the support, proud to do it for them and Team Penske! Thanks to Indycar and @JayRFrye for allowing me to have some fun and race some cars!" McLaughlin tweeted.
McLaughlin and Team Penski teammate Pagenaud won twice, and Norris and Sage Karam were the other winners of this series created for content while IndyCar is on hold.
Conor Daly finished second in Saturday's race and was followed by Ferrucci, who figured there would be a lot of angry drivers after the 175-mile (282 km) race.
"So many people are going to be salty over that," Ferrucci said.
"It's a video game. Let's try to have some fun."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Scott McLaughlin Wins On Indy Oval For 2nd Virtual Victory</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">other sports
Written By Associated Press Television News | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 03:38 IST
Scott McLaughlin was supposed to leave Australia for Indianapolis this month to make his IndyCar debut on the road course at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
With sports on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic, the two-time V8 SuperCars champion saw his IndyCar plans postponed.
McLaughlin instead settled for a virtual victory Saturday on the oval at Indianapolis Motor Speedway — his second win of IndyCar’s iRacing six-race series — after a wild finish in which most of the leaders crashed as they rushed toward the checkered flag.
“Unbelievable,” McLaughlin said. “I was literally just hoping there was going to be a wreck at the end. I thought we were going to be third, and then the three wrecked and we won.”
McLaughlin celebrated in the seat of his simulator in Australia with a glass of cold milk, a nod to the traditional victory celebration at the Indianapolis 500. He declined to pour it over his head while sitting in his expensive rig.
Formula One driver Lando Norris, winner of last week’s IndyCar virtual race, was headed for what appeared a 1-2-3 podium sweep for the Arrow McLaren SP entries on the final lap. But Norris ran into the back of Simon Pagenaud, a two-time iRacing winner and the defending Indy 500 champion, to take himself out of contention.
Then Oliver Askew and Pato O’Ward crashed, cars were sailing airborne and McLaughlin slid through the carnage to give Team Penske drivers their fourth win in the six-race series. McLaughlin and Pagenaud won twice, and Norris and Sage Karam were the other winners of this series created for content while IndyCar is on hold.
Conor Daly finished second and was followed by Santino Ferrucci, who figured there would be a lot of angry drivers after the 175-mile race.
“So many people are going to be salty over that,” Ferrucci said. “It’s a video game. Let’s try to have some fun.”
Daly, who has earned new fame through the iRacing series for his colorful commentary on his in-race stream, again delivered with one-liners and a humorous post-race speech.
“Quite a day on the internet today. It was an electric factory of a race. It was hilarious at the same time, I think we were involved in three accidents,” Daly said.
He then walked viewers through his setup from his Indianapolis home.
“I am sitting on one of four kitchen table chairs that is from downstairs. There is a mattress behind me, there’s not really much room for a simulator. My pedals are currently being supported by a box with a big, full thing of batteries on top of it because that provided some extra weight and stability. So yeah, pretty technological setup here in the Conor Daly Tech Center.”
The field of 33 gave 29 guaranteed slots to full-time IndyCar competitors, plus Norris, McLaughlin and part-time series driver Sage Karam based on their victories in previous iRacing events.
The final four slots were determined Wednesday in a special qualifying session and went to Scott Speed, Stefan Wilson, James Davison and RC Enerson. Those who tried to make the race but did not were Robert Wickens, who had raced the past four iRacing rounds, and defending NASCAR Cup champion Kyle Busch, who finished 13th in his IndyCar iRacing debut.
Also absent from the field were fan favorite James Hinchcliffe as well as Kyle Kaiser, Felipe Nasr and Spencer Pigot, who had all participated in previous IndyCar iRacing events.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thought of committing suicide three times due to severe stress, personal problems, reveals Mohammed Shami</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In a startling revelation, India fast bowler Mohammed Shami has claimed that he thought of committing suicide thrice while battling personal issues a few years ago, forcing his family to keep a watch over him at all times.
He said his family members feared he “might jump” from their 24th floor apartment.
Shami, one of India’s leading bowlers in recent years, opened up on his personal and professional life during an Instagram chat with teammate Rohit Sharma.
“I think if my family had not supported me back then I would have lost my cricket. I thought of committing suicide three times during that period due to severe stress and personal problems,” Shami revealed during the session on Saturday.
Now one of the mainstays of the Indian bowling attack across formats, the 29-year-old was struggling to focus on his cricket, then.
“I was not thinking about cricket at all. We were living on the 24th floor. They (family) were scared I might jump from the balcony. My brother supported me a lot.
“My 2-3 friends used to stay with me for 24 hours. My parents asked me to focus on cricket to recover from that phase and not think about anything else. I started training then and sweated it out a lot at an academy in Dehradun,” Shami said.
In March 2018, Shami’s wife Hasin Jahan had accused him of domestic violence and lodged a complaint with the police, following which the India player and his brother were booked under relevant sections.
The upheaval in his personal life forced his employer BCCI to withhold the player’s central contracts for a while.
“Rehab was stressful as the same exercises are repeated every day. Then family problems started and I also suffered an accident. The accident happened 10-12 days ahead of the IPL and my personal problems were running high in the media,” Shami told Rohit.
Shami said his family stood like a rock with him and the support helped him get back on his feet.
“Then my family explained that every problem has a solution no matter how big the problem. My brother supported me a lot.”
Speaking about another painful period in his life after his injury in the 2015 World Cup, Shami said it took him almost 18 months to get back on the field.
“When I got injured in the 2015 World Cup, after that it took me 18 months to fully recover, that was the most painful moment in my life, it was a very stressful period.”

Team India's second-innings hero in tests, Mohammed Shami on Saturday revealed that he had thought of committing suicide thrice during a period of 'severe stress and personal problems' in his life. Shami admitted that he was facing severe stress and had it not been for his family's support he would have lost his cricket. The star pacer was out of the team for almost 18 months after the semi-final exit in the 2015 ICC World Cup.

In an Instagram live session with India's limited-overs vice-captain Rohit Sharma, Shami reflected upon the brief period in his life where he was battling severe stress and also considered ending his life thrice. Shami revealed that he was not thinking about cricket at all and since he used to stay on the 24th floor of an apartment, his family worried that he would jump from the balcony. The right-arm pacer also revealed that 2-3 friends would stay with him throughout the day. He added that his family supported him immensely and asked him to focus on his game to recover from that phase and not think about anything else. He stated that he started training a lot at the academy in Dehradun after that.

While speaking to Smriti Mandhana and Jemimah Rodrigues on a YouTube chat show, Rohit Sharma revealed that Mohammed Shami is the toughest bowler he has ever faced in the nets. Sharma comically said that he has repeatedly requested Shami not to bowl bouncers at him in the nets, but to no avail, as he still has to face them since the fast bowler gets all charged up.

Rohit Sharma further said that Mohammed Shami is the toughest bowler to face in the nets as they have played a lot more against him in the nets. Rohit Sharma added that Jasprit Bumrah is also difficult to deal with but he has been playing alongside Mohammed Shami since 2012-13 and he faces Jasprit Bumrah in the Mumbai Indians nets as well. Rohit Sharma further said that he hasn’t faced Jasprit Bumrah as much as he has faced Mohammed Shami.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India speedster Mohammed Shami on Saturday revealed that he contemplated committing suicide at least thrice when he was enduring a difficult phase of his life in 2018.
Shami faced allegations of domestic violence and was booked after his wife Hasin Jahan lodged compliant against him.
"During that period there was also personal crisis in my life. You won’t believe it but I contemplated committing suicide three times during that period," Shami told his India teammate Rohit Shrama during an Instagram live session.
"My family members were worried that I might end up doing something drastic. I was just not able to thing about cricket at that point."
Shami said his family stood like a rock with him and that support helped him get back on his feet.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thought of Committing Suicide Thrice Due to Personal Issues: Shami Recounts Darkest Moments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India’s pace ace Mohammed Shami made a shocking revelation on Saturday that he contemplated committing suicide three times while dealing with severe stress due to personal and professional issues. During an Instagram live chat with Indian limited-overs vice-captain Rohit Sharma, Shami revealed that he struggled to maintain focus after an injury in the 2015 ICC World Cup which kept him away from the action for nearly 18 months. However, Shami credited his family for their unparalleled support during the testing times which helped him recover strongly.

In early 2018, Shami’s wife Hasin Jahan had accused the fast bowler of domestic violence. Shami and his brother were booked for domestic violence under IPC Section 498A. Jahan also posted screenshots of Shami’s alleged chats with different women on social media. A local court in West Bengal issued an arrest warrant against Shami in September last year in the case.

“In 2015 I was injured at the World Cup. After that it took some 18 months to get back (into the Indian team) and this was the most painful phase of my career,” said Shami. “You know how difficult rehab gets and after that came the family problems. That was going on and in between all that I had an accident which was around 10-12 days before the IPL. A lot of hype was going in the media also with my personal issues,” he said.

The 29-year-old attributes the support he got from his family as the reason why he managed to bounce back from that phase to become an integral part of Team India in all formats.
“I feel if I didn’t have support from my family, then I would have left cricket. I had thought of suicide thrice at the time. Someone used to sit with me in my house to keep an eye on me. The house was on the 24th floor and they were afraid that I might jump out of my apartment,” Shami said.
“My brother supported me a lot. My 2-3 friends used to stay with me for 24 hours. My parents asked me to focus on cricket to recover from that phase and not think about anything else. I started training then and sweated it out a lot at an academy in Dehradun,” he added.
Since then, Shami has taken some big strides in international cricket and went on to become an integral part of the Indian fast bowling unit along with the likes of Jasprit Bumrah, Ishant Sharma, Umesh Yadav, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar. He was the leading wicket-taker for India in the longest format in 2019. Shami scalped 33 wickets in just 8 Test matches last year.
At the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup, Shami became the second Indian bowler to take a World Cup hat-trick.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mohammed Shami Reveals He "Thought Of Committing Suicide Thrice" In Darkest Moments</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Indian pace sensation Mohammed Shami on Saturday opened up about the darkest moments of his life when he had thought of committing suicide thrice. In an Instagram Live session with teammate Rohit Sharma, Shami said after his injury in the 2015 ICC Cricket World Cup he almost took 18 months to get back on the field. The long 18 months were very stressful for Shami. The right-handed bowler said that after he started playing cricket again he went through some personal issues. Also in 2018, Shami's estranged wife Hasin Jahan had accused the cricketer of domestic violence. Shami said it was because of his family that he was able to face all the hardships.
"When I got injured in the 2015 World cup, after that it took me 18 months to fully recover, that was the most painful moment in my life, it was a very stressful period. When I started playing again, I had to go through some personal issues, I think if my family did not support me I would not have made it, I also thought of committing suicide three times," said Shami.
"Someone used to stay with me 24*7, I was not well mentally, my family was there for me, if your family is there then you can get through any situation. If my family was not there then I might have taken a bad step, but I thank my family for being with me throughout," he added.
Shami was last seen in action during the two-match Test series against New Zealand. The pacer would have been in action for the Kings XI Punjab if the IPL had started on March 29.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Thought of committing suicide thrice: India pacer Mohammed Shami on battling personal issues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India pacer Mohammed Shami said he thought of taking his life thrice while battling personal issues a few years ago.
During an Instagram chat with Rohit Sharma, Shami said that it was hard for him to get back on the field after his injury during the 2015 World Cup, taking him nearly 18 months to make a full recovery.
The pacer later went through a difficult period in 2018 after estranged wife Hasin Jahan had accused Shami and his family of alleged domestic abuse while also accusing the India pacer of age fudging and match-fixing.
Things started getting worse for Shami who was also involved in a minor accident just before the 2018 edition of the Indian Premier League where he suffered minor injuries.
“When I got injured in the 2015 World Cup, after that it took me 18 months to fully recover, that was the most painful moment in my life, it was a very stressful period,” Shami told Rohit.
“Rehab was stressful as the same exercises are repeated every day. Then, there were family problems too and I also suffered an accident. The accident happened 10-12 days ahead of the IPL and my personal problems was also played out in the media,” he added.
Shami has put all those problems behind, establishing himself as an indispensable bowler in India’s Test team while also being a part of their limited-overs set-up.
“I think if my family had not supported me back then I would have lost my cricket. I thought of committing suicide three times during that period due to severe stress and personal problems.
“I was not thinking about cricket at all. We were living on the 24th floor. They [family] were scared I might jump from the balcony. My brother supported me a lot. I had 2-3 friends used to stay with me through the day. My parents asked me to focus on cricket to recover from that phase and not think about anything else. I started training then and sweated it out a lot at an academy in Dehradun,” he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'I thought of committing suicide three times': Mohammed Shami reveals darkest moments of his life</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: In a startling revelation, India speedster Mohammed Shami has claimed that he thought of committing suicide thrice while battling personal issues a few years ago, forcing his family to keep a watch over him at all times.
He said his family members feared he "might jump" from their 24th floor apartment.
Shami, one of India's leading bowlers in recent years, opened up on his personal and professional life during an Instagram chat with teammate and limited overs squads' vice-captain Rohit Sharma.
"I think if my family had not supported me back then I would have lost my cricket. I thought of committing suicide three times during that period due to severe stress and personal problems," Shami revealed during the session on Saturday.

Now one of the mainstays of Indian bowling attack across formats, the 29-year-old was struggling to focus on his cricket, then.
"I was not thinking about cricket at all. We were living on the 24th floor. They (family) were scared I might jump from the balcony. My brother supported me a lot.
"My 2-3 friends used to stay with me for 24 hours. My parents asked me to focus on cricket to recover from that phase and not think about anything else. I started training then and sweated it out a lot at an academy in Dehradun," Shami said.
In March 2018, Shami's wife Hasin Jahan had accused him of domestic violence and lodged a complaint with the police, following which the India player and his brother were booked under relevant sections.
The upheaval in his personal life forced his employer BCCI to withheld the player's central contracts for a while.
"Rehab was stressful as the same exercises are repeated every day. Then family problems started and I also suffered an accident. The accident happened 10-12 days ahead of the IPL and my personal problems were running high in the media," Shami told Rohit.
Shami said his family stood like a rock with him and the support helped him get back on his feet.
"Then my family explained that every problem has a solution no matter how big the problem. My brother supported me a lot."
Speaking about another painful period in his life after his injury in the 2015 World Cup, Shami said it took him almost 18 months to get back on the field.
"When I got injured in the 2015 World Cup, after that it took me 18 months to fully recover, that was the most painful moment in my life, it was a very stressful period."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Favourite Secretariat wins virtual Kentucky Derby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Secretariat won a virtual Kentucky Derby against 12 fellow Triple Crown winners, 47 years after the chestnut colt won the real race at Churchill Downs.
The 1 1/4-mile race featuring computer-generated imagery was held Saturday, the same day the 146th Derby had been scheduled until it was postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Derby has been reset for Sept. 5.
Secretariat was the 7-2 favourite, although there was no wagering. Instead, fans selecting the winning horse online were entered to win a VIP experience at the Derby this fall. Churchill Downs pledged to match US$1-million in fan donations to COVID-19 relief.
The virtual Derby was part of NBC’s three-hour telecast that reshowed portions of the 2015 coverage, in which American Pharoah won on his way to becoming racing’s first Triple Crown champion in 37 years.
The show opened with Churchill Downs bugler Steve Buttleman playing Call to the Post from the front steps of his Louisville home. It moved to the track, with shots of empty stands, betting windows and the jockeys’ room.
The track’s stable area is set to reopen May 11, with live racing expected to resume May 16.
“It’s weird not being there,” Bob Baffert, who trained American Pharoah, said in an interview from his California home.
Larry Collmus, who calls the Triple Crown races for NBC, provided a live call for the virtual Derby, seeing it unfold for the first time just as he would have been doing on the first Saturday in May.
“That was fun ‘calling’ Secretariat and the other Triple Crown winners,” he tweeted.
A virtual Seattle Slew, who won the 1977 Triple Crown, led much of the way until being overtaken in the stretch.
Secretariat surged to the lead in deep stretch in the middle of the track. No margins were provided.
The computer imagery failed to capture the dirt from the track that sticks to the horses running in the back, and there was no noise from the usual Derby day crowd of 150,000 or more. The race lacked the cavalry charge to the first turn that is typical of the usual 20-horse Derby field.
Secretariat was a two-time Horse of the Year, and swept the Derby, Preakness and Belmont, winning the last race by a record 31 lengths, in 1973.
Citation, the 1948 Triple Crown champion, finished second. Seattle Slew was third. Affirmed, the 1978 champion, was fourth, followed by American Pharoah.
NBC showed the real American Pharoah at Ashford Stud, where a flat-screen TV was set up in front of his stall to show the race. Now eight-years-old, he is a successful stallion with a stud fee of US$200,000.
Churchill Downs analyzed the historical past performance of each Triple Crown winner, and incorporated the opinions of horse-racing experts, who evaluated each contender’s achievements and put them into historical perspective.
That information, known as the fundamental probabilities, was fed into Inspire Entertainment’s computer models, which determined the final result by using those probabilities along with random number generation. The fundamental probabilities only determined the chances of each horse winning. Those with a higher probability value weren’t necessarily going to win; they just had a greater chance of doing so.
Also in the race were 1946 champion Assault, 1919 champion Sir Barton, 1930 champion Gallant Fox, 1937 champion War Admiral, 1941 champion Whirlaway, 1943 champion Count Fleet, 2018 champion Justify and 1935 champion Omaha.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Horse racing: Secretariat wins Triple Crown showdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">REUTERS: Secretariat found his stride down the stretch and emerged victorious on Saturday in a computer-simulated Kentucky Derby, which pitted all of horse racing's 13 Triple Crown winners against each other.
Seattle Slew led for most of the race but had to settle for third after being overtaken by the victorious chestnut stallion, who won the Triple Crown in 1973 and whose story inspired a Disney film in 2010.
Citation, who won the Triple Crown in 1948 and was the first race horse to earn US$1 million, came in second.
The Triple Crown consists of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes and was most recently won by Justify in 2018.
Horse racing has gone online as the coronavirus crisis forces the cancellation or postponement of meetings, including this month's Grand National in Britain, which was also turned into a virtual race instead.
With the Kentucky Derby forced from its traditional first Saturday in May by the coronavirus outbreak, the first jewel of horse racing's real Triple Crown was postponed until Sept. 5.
Churchill Downs, which is home to the Kentucky Derby, said it was hoping to raise US$2 million for COVID-19 emergency relief from the race, which utilized data algorithms to help determine the probability of their potential finishing positions.
Churchill Downs on Thursday said it will open for spectator-free racing on May 16 under strict guidelines to mitigate risks from the COVID-19 pandemic.
It added that it hopes to have fans in attendance for its famous race in September.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Horse racing: Secretariat wins Triple Crown showdown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Secretariat found his stride down the stretch and emerged victorious on Saturday in a computer-simulated Kentucky Derby, which pitted all of horse racing's 13 Triple Crown winners against each other.
Seattle Slew led for most of the race but had to settle for third after being overtaken by the victorious chestnut stallion, who won the Triple Crown in 1973 and whose story inspired a Disney film in 2010.
Citation, who won the Triple Crown in 1948 and was the first race horse to earn $1 million, came in second.
The Triple Crown consists of the Kentucky Derby, Preakness and Belmont Stakes and was most recently won by Justify in 2018.
Horse racing has gone online as the coronavirus crisis forces the cancellation or postponement of meetings, including this month's Grand National in Britain, which was also turned into a virtual race instead.
With the Kentucky Derby forced from its traditional first Saturday in May by the coronavirus outbreak, the first jewel of horse racing's real Triple Crown was postponed until Sept. 5.
Churchill Downs (NASDAQ:CHDN), which is home to the Kentucky Derby, said it was hoping to raise $2 million for COVID-19 emergency relief from the race, which utilized data algorithms to help determine the probability of their potential finishing positions.
Churchill Downs on Thursday said it will open for spectator-free racing on May 16 under strict guidelines to mitigate risks from the COVID-19 pandemic.
It added that it hopes to have fans in attendance for its famous race in September.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Secretariat wins virtual Kentucky Derby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Secretariat won a virtual Kentucky Derby against 12 fellow Triple Crown winners, 47 years after the chestnut colt won the real race at Churchill Downs.
The 1 1/4-mile race featuring computer-generated imagery was held Saturday, the same day the 146th Derby had been scheduled until it was postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. The Derby has been re-set for Sept. 5.
Secretariat was the 7-2 favorite, although there was no wagering. Instead, fans selecting the winning horse online were entered to win a VIP experience at the Derby this fall. Churchill Downs pledged to match $1 million in fan donations to COVID-19 relief.
The virtual Derby was part of NBC’s three-hour telecast that re-showed portions of the 2015 coverage in which American Pharoah won on his way to becoming racing’s first Triple Crown champion in 37 years.
The show opened with Churchill Downs bugler Steve Buttleman playing “Call to the Post” from the front steps of his Louisville home. It moved to the track, with shots of empty stands, betting windows and the jockeys’ room.
The track’s stable area is set to re-open May 11, with live racing expected to resume May 16.

“It’s weird not being there,” Bob Baffert, who trained American Pharoah, said in an interview from his California home.
Larry Collmus, who calls the Triple Crown races for NBC, provided a live call for the virtual Derby, seeing it unfold for the first time just as he would have been doing on the first Saturday in May.
“That was fun ”calling” Secretariat and the other Triple Crown winners,” he tweeted.
A virtual Seattle Slew, who won the 1977 Triple Crown, led much of the way until being overtaken in the stretch.
Secretariat surged to the lead in deep stretch in the middle of the track. No margins were provided.
The computer imagery failed to capture the dirt from the track that sticks to the horses running in the back, and there was no noise from the usual Derby day crowd of 150,000 or more. The race lacked the cavalry charge to the first turn that is typical of the usual 20-horse Derby field.

Secretariat was a two-time Horse of the Year and swept the Derby, Preakness and Belmont, winning the last race by a record 31 lengths, in 1973.
Citation, the 1948 Triple Crown champion, finished second. Seattle Slew was third. Affirmed, the 1978 champion, was fourth, followed by American Pharoah.
NBC showed the real American Pharoah at Ashford Stud, where a flat-screen TV was set up in front of his stall to show the race. Now 8-years-old, he is a successful stallion with a stud fee of $200,000.
Churchill Downs analyzed the historical past performance of each Triple Crown winner and incorporated the opinions of horse racing experts who evaluated each contender’s achievements and put them into historical perspective.
That information, known as the fundamental probabilities, was fed into Inspire Entertainment’s computer models, which determined the final result by using those probabilities along with random number generation. The fundamental probabilities only determined the chances of each horse winning. Those with a higher probability value weren’t necessarily going to win; they just had a greater chance of doing so.
Also in the race were 1946 champion Assault, 1919 champion Sir Barton, 1930 champion Gallant Fox, 1937 champion War Admiral, 1941 champion Whirlaway, 1943 champion Count Fleet, 2018 champion Justify and 1935 champion Omaha.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Motor racing: Vettel makes his esports debut in Legends Trophy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (Reuters) - Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel made his esports debut on Saturday in Legends Trophy races that also featured retired Formula One world champions Emerson Fittipaldi and Jenson Button.
The German has some time on his hands with Formula One’s season stalled by the COVID-19 pandemic and organisers hoping to get going in Austria at the start of July.
The four times champion finished 15th and 12th respectively after being caught up in incidents on the virtual version of the Sepang circuit that hosted the Malaysian Grand Prix between 1999 and 2017.
While Vettel, 32, and Button, 40, are both actual Malaysian Grand Prix winners, 73-year-old Fittipaldi’s time was in the 1970s when the real Brabham BT44s, simulated in the virtual race, were around.
The first race was won by Colombian former McLaren and Williams F1 driver Juan Pablo Montoya, a double Indianapolis 500 winner, while the second went to Mexican Adrian Fernandez.
Vettel’s team mate Charles Leclerc has been active on various platforms from his Monaco apartment, even taking part in virtual lawn mower and truck races.
The 22-year-old Monegasque has also won two Formula One virtual races and will take part in another on Sunday, which would have been the day of the postponed Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort.
Vettel acquired a simulator only recently from the Allinsports company owned by Torque Esports, organisers of the Legends Trophy, and said he would try it out for fun at his Swiss home.
“I’m aware that some people take it very seriously and spend a lot of time there but I also enjoy doing other things,” the German, a father of three, told reporters this month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Combating COVID-19: PCB to help first-class cricketers, match officials</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Sunday announced that it will be helping and supporting first-class cricketers and other stakeholders who have been facing hardships in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown.
All sporting action across the world has come to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic and as a result, many first-class cricketers are facing problems.
The PCB has revealed that along with the first-class cricketers, the board will also be extending help to the match officials, scorers, and ground staff.
"The PCB feels it has a duty of care towards its stakeholders and, as such, it is imperative that we stand by our people during the lockdown period and support them in the lead up to Eid Al-Fitr. It was the right time to support cricketers, match officials, scorers, and ground staff in this hour of need," PCB chairman Ehsan Mani said in an official statement.

"It is also heartening to see our cricketers coming out and supporting the people in need by auctioning their prized possessions and through various charities. While I am sure many players are making donations in private, I want to applaud and appreciate Shahid Afridi, Rumman Raees, and Azhar Ali who have been at the forefront of this noble cause and have been doing outstanding work," he added.
The board has set aside funds from its current fiscal year and with the help of those funds, the PCB would be extending support.
With limited funds available, the PCB has set out eligibility criteria and it is as follows-- First-class cricketers who featured in the 2018-19 season and have played at least 15 first-class matches in the past five seasons from 2014-15 to 2018-19, match officials and scorers who have officiated in PCB-organised events over the past two seasons and ground staff that had been employed by the now-defunct regional/district cricket associations before January 1, 2013 (should have approximately eight years of service).
The first-class cricketers, who will meet the criteria, will receive PKR 25,000. The match officials will get PKR 15,000, while the scorers and grounds staff will be given PKR 10,000.
Earlier, the PCB had contributed PKR 10 million to the Prime Minister's COVID-19 Pandemic Relief Fund with half of the share coming from the centrally contracted men and women cricketers and the PCB staffers.

According to a statement, the board will provide Rs25,000 to first-class cricketers, Rs15,000 to match officials and Rs10,000 to scorers and ground staff who fulfill the conditions set by the body.

According to the statement, PCB chief Ehsan Mani said that the cricket board is aware of its “duty of care towards its stakeholders and, as such, it is imperative that we stand by our people during the lockdown period and support them in the lead up to Eid Al-Fitr”.
The statement noted that “it was the right time to support cricketers, match officials, scorers and grounds staff” when the epidemic has virtually brought life to a standstill leading to a halt in economic activity.
“It is also heartening to see our cricketers coming out and supporting the people in need by auctioning their prized possessions and through various charities.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Source: Bengals not picking up fifth-year option on WR John Ross</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CINCINNATI -- The Bengals have informed wide receiver John Ross that they will not be picking up the fifth year of his rookie contract, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Saturday.
Ross, who was selected ninth overall in the 2017 draft, has struggled to stay on the field during his first three NFL seasons. The former Washington product has played a total of 24 games.
The 24-year-old Ross is set to earn $2.8 million in base salary in 2020.
Under the rules of the current collective bargaining agreement, the value of Ross' fifth-year option would be equivalent to the transition tag for a wide receiver since he was a top-10 pick. In 2020, the transition tag for a receiver was worth $15.7 million.
In 2019, Ross was on the verge of a promising season. He opened the year with a career-high 158 receiving yards and two touchdowns in a loss at Seattle. A week later, he had four catches for 112 yards and a score in a blowout loss to San Francisco.
He injured his sternoclavicular joint in a Week 4 loss to Pittsburgh, however, and was placed on injured reserve. He finished last season as a reserve, catching 28 passes for 506 yards and three touchdowns.
Ross has 49 career catches for 716 yards and 10 touchdowns.
Ross joins A.J. Green as Bengals receivers who are not under contract beyond the 2020 season. Green was given a one-year franchise tag after his previous contract lapsed following the 2019 season.
Cincinnati drafted former Clemson wideout Tee Higgins in the second round of this year's draft.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1 (UPI) -- The Tennessee Titans are declining to pick up the fifth-year option on wide receiver Corey Davis.
ESPN and NFL Media confirmed the Titans' decision to not pick up the option Friday, meaning Davis will be in a contract year this season. According to ESPN, the fifth-year option would have carried a $15.68 million salary for Davis in the 2021 campaign.
Davis, the No. 5 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, has struggled with consistency in his first three seasons in Tennessee. Since entering the league, he has recorded 142 receptions for 1,867 yards and six touchdowns in 42 career games.
In 2019, Davis notched only two receiving scores during the regular season and another touchdown in the postseason against the Baltimore Ravens on a pass from star running back Derrick Henry. His best season came in 2018, when he set career highs in receptions (65), receiving yards (891) and touchdowns (four).
Meanwhile, the Titans are exercising the fifth-year option on cornerback Adoree' Jackson, according to ESPN and NFL Media. By picking up the option, the Titans guarantee Jackson's contract for injury only in 2021 and his salary will be about $10.24 million.
Jackson, the No. 18 overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft, has started 39 games over three NFL seasons. He has two interceptions and 33 passes defensed in his career.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MILAN
Players from several Italian football clubs were on course to resume individual training as the Mediterranean country prepared to gradually roll back its coronavirus lockdown.
The Italian government has been feuding for weeks with individual regions about which activities will be allowed when the nation begins to emerge from an economically crippling lockdown on Monday.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is lifting Italians' stay-at-home orders and permitting restaurants to resume takeout service next week.
But Conte has delayed announcing a restart to the Serie A season for fear of another spike in contagions for a disease that has officially killed 28,710 in Italy - second only to the United States.
Conte is only allowing clubs to resume team training on May 18.
Several regions that have avoided the worst of the outbreak say they will use a loophole to individual players to start training on Monday.
The voluntary sessions will affect teams such as Napoli in the south and the central Emilia-Romagna region's Bologna.
Parma announced they will open their facilities next week for use by their squad members
Rome's Lazio have also voiced plans to resume individual training at their sport centre.
But rules published by Sassuolo made clear that none of their coaches or other staff will be involved in the sessions.
Up to six players on an open pitch at a time will be allowed and they will be barred from using the changing rooms to minimise the threat of contagion.
Serie A clubs unanimously voted on Friday to finish the 2019-20 season - suspended since March 9 with Juventus leading Lazio by a point.
But Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora noted this week the chances of a restart were "increasingly narrow".

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Italy offered Serie A clubs a glimmer of hope on Sunday after it said footballers could take part in individual training sessions as the strictest coronavirus lockdown measures begin to ease.
The interior ministry's go-ahead for players to attend their club's training facilities offered fans in the football mad country the first sign that the 2019-20 season might yet be saved.
Matches were abandoned on March 9 in the face of a health crisis that has now officially claimed nearly 29,000 lives in Italy and 245,000 worldwide.
Some of the bigger clubs with title aspirations from the less affected regions have been talking about going back to training for weeks.
But Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte only allowed teams to resume organised activities on May 18 -- a date that might push back this season's completion into the start of the next.
Several regions that have avoided the worst of the pandemic have taken matters into their own hands and allowed clubs to open their facilities for players to train on their own.
Teams such as Napoli and Parma have followed the lead of Lazio -- trailing leaders Juventus by just a point -- and gave the nod for players to return.
They insisted that they were not breaking the rules because Conte has allowed all Italians to start exercising in open public places starting Monday.
The interior ministry bowed to the seemingly inevitable on Sunday and agreed that teams can open their facilities to players for training.
"Athletes, professional or otherwise, of non-individual sports are allowed -- just as every citizen -- to exercise in public or private areas," the interior ministry said.
But players must "respect social distancing rules of at least two metres and the ban on public gatherings."
Italian media read the statement as an encouraging sign for football.
"Serie A clubs (and not only) can return to training," the La Repubblica daily wrote.
Yet Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora has noted that the path for football to return was getting "increasingly narrow".
And league president Paolo Dal Pino said Serie A "will comply" should Conte decide that it was simply too dangerous to complete the campaign.
The teams themselves seem hopelessly divided about what they should do.
Those that play in northern regions that were hardest hit by the virus have voiced the gravest concern.
Brescia president Massimo Cellino -- whose team is based at the very heart of the outbreak -- said in March that he would rather forfeit games than play in a "plague".
The 63-year-old revealed that he had tested positive for the virus a few weeks later.
"It would be unfortunate if some teams can start again and others cannot," Fiorentina coach Beppe Iachini said on Saturday.
"I think teams like Atalanta, Milan, Inter, Juve and Turino have had more problems than the others," he said of the main northern clubs.
"If we do start, we have to do it all together."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Players from several Italian football clubs were on course to resume individual training as the Mediterranean country prepared to gradually roll back its coronavirus lockdown. The Italian government has been feuding for weeks with individual regions about which activities will be allowed when the nation begins to emerge from an economically crippling lockdown on Monday. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is lifting Italians' stay-at-home orders and permitting restaurants to resume takeout service next week.
But Conte has delayed announcing a restart to the Serie A season for fear of another spike in contagions for a disease that has officially killed 28,710 in Italy -- second only to the United States.
Conte is only allowing clubs to resume team training on May 18.
Several regions that have avoided the worst of the outbreak say they will use a loophole to individual players to start training on Monday.
The voluntary sessions will affect teams such as Napoli in the south and the central Emilia-Romagna region's Bologna.
Parma announced they will open their facilities next week for use by their squad members
Rome's Lazio have also voiced plans to resume individual training at their sport centre.
But rules published by Sassuolo made clear that none of their coaches or other staff will be involved in the sessions.
Up to six players on an open pitch at a time will be allowed and they will be barred from using the changing rooms to minimise the threat of contagion.
Serie A clubs unanimously voted on Friday to finish the 2019-20 season -- suspended since March 9 with Juventus leading Lazio by a point.
But Sports Minister Vincenzo Spadafora noted this week the chances of a restart were "increasingly narrow".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Sassuolo become first Serie A club to announce return to training</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sassuolo have become the first Serie A team to announce a resumption of training activities amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Optional individual sessions will be allowed to take place at the Mapei Football Center from Monday, although social distancing rules must be complied with and there can be no mass gatherings.
A decree issued by the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy on Thursday opened the door for Sassuolo, SPAL, Bologna and Parma to return to training next week.
The rest of the Serie A clubs have to wait until at least May 18, which is the day after the Italian government's existing lockdown measures are due to expire.
A Sassuolo statement read: "Players will only be allowed access to the pitches in compliance with rules of social distancing, while access to the Sports Center (locker rooms, gyms, offices) will be prohibited.
"The individual sessions, which will take place during the mornings from Monday to Friday, with the use of three fields, with six players per hour (one player for each half of the pitch), will not be attended by the technical staff, while an emergency health supervision will be guaranteed."
It was reported on Friday that all 20 Serie A clubs had voted to see out the rest of the 2019-20 season, which has been suspended since March 9 due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
A date for the return of competitive fixtures is yet to be confirmed.
While the Premier League, Bundesliga and LaLiga are also committed to finishing the campaign, the Eredivisie and Ligue 1 this week cancelled their seasons prematurely.
There have been over 209,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths in Italy.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Sassuolo become first Serie A club to announce return to training</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sassuolo have become the first Serie A team to announce a resumption of training activities amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Optional individual sessions will be allowed to take place at the Mapei Football Center from Monday, although social distancing rules must be complied with and there can be no mass gatherings.
A decree issued by the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy on Thursday opened the door for Sassuolo, SPAL, Bologna and Parma to return to training next week.
The rest of the Serie A clubs have to wait until at least May 18, which is the day after the Italian government's existing lockdown measures are due to expire.
A Sassuolo statement read: "Players will only be allowed access to the pitches in compliance with rules of social distancing, while access to the Sports Center (locker rooms, gyms, offices) will be prohibited.
"The individual sessions, which will take place during the mornings from Monday to Friday, with the use of three fields, with six players per hour (one player for each half of the pitch), will not be attended by the technical staff, while an emergency health supervision will be guaranteed."
It was reported on Friday that all 20 Serie A clubs had voted to see out the rest of the 2019-20 season, which has been suspended since March 9 due to the COVID-19 outbreak.
A date for the return of competitive fixtures is yet to be confirmed.
While the Premier League, Bundesliga and LaLiga are also committed to finishing the campaign, the Eredivisie and Ligue 1 this week cancelled their seasons prematurely.
There have been over 209,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths in Italy.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez is optimistic sport will soon be able to resume but warned crowds will have to stay away.
The country has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, suffering over 25,000 deaths, but the infection rate has been falling since its early-April peak.
There are now hopes that professional sport, including football's LaLiga, will return to lift spirits after being put on hold in March.
Asked in a news conference on Saturday about that prospect, Sanchez said: "I am more basketball than football, but hopefully soon. It will be the federations and the leagues that decide.
"We have begun to allow individual training in team sports, hopefully it will be as soon as possible."
There is believed to be no possibility of sport in front of crowds for now.
Sanchez added: "Obviously we will see it earlier on television than in stadiums, I'm afraid."
LaLiga is expected to push for a return to competition by mid-June, its president Javier Tebas has indicated.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United plan to play games at Old Trafford without fans until 2021</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United chiefs are reportedly planning for football without fans at Old Trafford potentially until 2021 when the sport restarts.
Red Devils bosses fear there will be no mass gatherings allowed until next year when a vaccine may be widely available and are therefore developing a strategy to put on matches without supporters.
Their position is similar to other top clubs who are looking to cope for long spells with no fans at matches in Premier League games.
And in preparing for the worst case scenario, it’s feared that they could be forced to do so beyond February 2021, according to the Mirror.

It’s thought that allowing huge sporting crowds will be one of the last things to return to normal life amid the pandemic, with large gatherings representing a big threat to the Covid-19 crisis spiking again.
United are in a solid position financially but are factoring loss of revenue from an empty Old Trafford into future financial forecasts.
A source told the Mirror: ‘It’s highly likely there will be no spectators allowed at football games for several months until either a vaccine is available or coronavirus is brought under significant control.
‘The prospect of seeing full stadiums at Premier League grounds just isn’t going to happen anytime soon and clubs are aware of that.
‘It would be reckless if clubs didn’t budget for that happening. The realism is that the prospect of crowds returning to football is a long, long way off.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man Utd planning to play without fans at Old Trafford until 2021</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United's money-men are preparing for a doomsday scenario of empty stadiums for up to SIX months after football re-starts.
And they aren't alone with many leading clubs believing mass gatherings and a return to capacity stadiums of up to 75,000 fans may not happen until NEXT year when a vaccine may be widely available.
Like many top clubs, I understand United's financial planners are building various strategies to copy with a long-term absence of crowds from Premier League games.
And it's believed the worst scenario could even extend beyond February 2021 as the world battles to bring the deadly pandemic under control.
Clubs believe the sanctioning of huge sporting crowds for football matches will be the last of the lockdown planks to be removed.
Medical advisors to the Government say lifting restrictions to allow big crowds at sporting events would represents a big danger to the Covid-19 outbreak gaining another foothold – and they aren't willing to take that risk for several months.
United's financial position is more robust than many clubs but senior club officials are acutely aware crowds may not return to Old Trafford and other stadiums for months.
And executive vice chairman Ed Woodward and his management team are factoring that scenario into their financial forecasts as they try to find a way to mitigate the on-going damage.

A source said: “It's highly likely there will be no spectators allowed at football games for several months until either a vaccine is available or coronavirus is brought under significant control.
“The prospect of seeing full stadiums at Premier League grounds just isn't going to happen anytime soon and clubs are aware of that.
“It would be reckless if clubs didn't budget for that happening. The realism is that the prospect of crowds returning to football is a long, long way off.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man Utd planning to play without fans at Old Trafford until 2021</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United's money-men are preparing for a doomsday scenario of empty stadiums for up to SIX months after football re-starts.
And they aren't alone with many leading clubs believing mass gatherings and a return to capacity stadiums of up to 75,000 fans may not happen until NEXT year when a vaccine may be widely available.
Like many top clubs, I understand United's financial planners are building various strategies to copy with a long-term absence of crowds from Premier League games.
And it's believed the worst scenario could even extend beyond February 2021 as the world battles to bring the deadly pandemic under control.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dennis Bergkamp leading consortium aiming to buy Premier League club</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp is part of a consortium looking to buy a Premier League club.
Along with the former Gunners ace is ex- Liverpool star Dirk Kuyt, former Barcelona star Ronald Koeman, Derby manager Phillip Cocu and Henrik Larsson, who plied his trade at Celtic and Manchester United.
The coronavirus crisis has left finances in tatters at clubs and the future is not certain for some.
It has provided the chance for these teams to be bought for peanuts, especially if the lockdown prevents the new season from starting.
Dutch agent Ron Jansen is the brains behind an operation that intends to jump at this opportunity.
He is an executive at Wasserman Media Group, which includes the famous former footballers.
At an estimated £3.2bn, Wasserman is the second-largest sports agency in the world.
Jansen said: “We are in the waiting room, as we call it. In this crisis, the asking price of some clubs will be lowered.
“At the same time the internal - struggles at these clubs will get bigger.”
This summer will be the second time the business has tried to snap up a Premier League club after failing not long ago.
But the 64-year-old has not given up hope despite his disappointment.
Jansen added: “Recently we were very close to a deal. I am not going to say now which club that was, but at the very last moment we were beaten by a foreign investor.
“That was very disappointing.”
Jansen has represented some of the biggest players from Holland in recent years and some have now become business partners.
The six stars joining him in his latest venture have all got experience of working in England, with Bergkamp's star the biggest in this country.
The 50-year-old shot to fame with Arsenal that saw him win three Premier League titles and four FA Cups in an 11-year stint at Highbury.
A statue of him resides outside the Emirates and he is regarded as one of the best players the league has ever seen.
His last hurrah in football came at boyhood club Ajax where he was assistant manager until December 2017.
However, a fallout with club chiefs Marc Overmars and Edwin van der Sar saw him depart.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dennis Bergkamp heading star-studded consortium keen to buy English club</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arsenal legend Dennis Bergkamp is leading a consortium of football superstars aiming to buy an English club.
The former Gunners ace has joined forces with Derby manager Phillip Cocu, ex-Liverpool favourite Dirk Kuyt, current Holland coach Ronald Koeman and former Celtic hero Henrik Larsson in a bid to break into the market.
And, with England’s clubs -facing a devastating financial meltdown if the plan to restart the season after the lockdown fails, the belief is that many clubs will be up for grabs in the coming months.
Dutch super-agent Rob Jansen, an executive at global marketing giants Wasserman Media Group, is the -business brain behind the project.
Wasserman is the second largest sports agency in the world, worth an estimated £3.2bn.
Jansen revealed: “We are in the waiting room, as we call it. In this crisis, the asking price of some clubs will be lowered.
“At the same time the internal -struggles at these clubs will get bigger.”
The group failed with a bid to buy a club last year.
Jansen added: “Recently we were very close to a deal. I am not going to say now which club that was, but at the very last moment we were beaten by a foreign investor.
“That was very disappointing.”
Jansen, 64, has been a powerful presence in the game for more than 25 years.
He represented all of his business partners when they were at the height of their fame.
All six men have experience of working inside the English game and are ready to spend their own money to make their dream happen.
Bergkamp, 50, is regarded as one of the Premier League’s greatest players after a 11-year stint at Arsenal that saw him win the Premier League three times and lift the FA Cup on four occasions.
A statue outside the Emirates honours the Dutchman’s service to the Gunners.
But Bergkamp has not been -involved in football since leaving the coaching set-up at Ajax in December 2017 after clashing with executives and former team-mates Edwin van der Sar and Marc Overmars.
He is currently helping out at his daughter’s hockey club.
But he is itching for an opportunity to return to the game he graced with such distinction.
Berkamp would want a hands-on role at any potential club.
He is eyeing a position that would allow him to oversee the entire -set-up, with emphasis on developing a pathway for young players from the academy to the senior team.
Bergkamp’s business partners also come from fine footballing stock.
We're testing a new site: This content is coming soon
Kuyt, 39, was a firm favourite during six years at Anfield and has been working in the youth system at Feyenoord since retiring.
And 48-year-old Larsson is boss of Helsingborgs after a playing career that included spells at Manchester United, Celtic and Barcelona.
Former Southampton and Everton boss Koeman also played for Barca.
As did Cocu, who became Derby manager last summer and guided PSV Eindhoven to their first Dutch title in seven years back in 2015.
The move could not be better timed, as Newcastle are on the verge of a £300m takeover backed by the government of Saudi Arabia.
But EFL and Premier League clubs face losses of millions if the proposed restart has to be halted.
Those losses could open the door for new investors like the ones being advised by Jansen.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Icelandic actor and strongman Hafthor Bjornsson set a world record for the deadlift on Saturday when he lifted 1,104 pounds (501 kg) at Thor’s Power Gym in Iceland, reported Reuters. 
Bjornsson, best known for his portrayal of Ser Gregor ‘The Mountain’ Clegane on the popular HBO series Game of Thrones, broke the record previously held by Briton Eddie Hall who in 2016 became the first man to lift 500 kg.
The event was streamed live on ESPN here and Bjornsson, 31, lifted the barbell that was bending and straining under the weights, holding it for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
Bjornsson, who is six feet and nine inches tall, is also the winner of the World’s Strongest Man competition from back in 2018.
Speaking in a “behind-the-scenes” video posted on YouTube, Bjornsson said: “I’m extremely proud, you know. I’m extremely happy. It’s great – there’s nothing better than proving people wrong. So many people didn’t believe in me, so many people that said, ‘501 kg is never going to go up’… But I also had a lot of support.”
“I feel healthy, I feel good. I’m just absolutely speechless, even though I’m talking a lot now. But I’m excited, super excited – this is huge for me,” he added ecstatically.

    <h5 class="mb-1">“Game Of Thrones” Actor Hafthor Bjornsson Breaks World Deadlift Record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hafthor Bjornsson, who played Ser Gregor Clegane, better known as ‘The Mountain’ in “Game of Thrones” has set a new deadlifting world record.
Bjornsson, 31, broke the previous record held by Eddie Hall in 2016 for lifting 500 kilograms (1,102 pounds). On Saturday, Bjornsson lifted 1,104 pounds (501 kilograms) at Thor’s Power Gym in Iceland.
The actor and strongman completed the lift as the barbell bent and strained under the weights. He held the lift for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
On Instagram, he said;
“I have no words. What an amazing day, one I will remember for the rest of my life. I said I was coming for it, and once I set my mind on something, I’m a dog with a bone. I want to give a huge shoutout to my family, friends, coaches, fans, sponsors and haters, all of whom helped this lift be possible.”
Bjornsson, who is 6 feet 9 inches tall and weighs 452 pounds had won the World’s Strongest Man competition in 2018 and has earned third place or higher every year since 2012. He is the first person to have won the Arnold Strongman Classic, Europe’s Strongest Man and World’s Strongest Man in the same calendar year.

“I believe today I could’ve done more, but what’s the point?” the 31-year-old Bjornsson told ESPN. “I’m happy with this.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hafthor Julius Bjornsson: Game of Thrones star says he ‘could have done more’ after breaking deadlift world record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The actor who played The Mountain inGame of Thrones, is celebrating after successfully deadlifting more than any other human in history.
However, shortly after Icelandic star Hafthor Júlíus Björnsson broke the world record, he admitted he “could have done more”.
Björnsson, who won fans for his portrayal of the towering Clegane brother in the HBO series, deadlifted 1,104 pounds live on ESPN – that’s 501 kilograms – with relative ease.
The previous record was 500 kilograms (1,102 pounds), which was lifted by Eddie Hall in 2016.
After breaking the record, he wrote on Instagram: “I have no words. What an amazing day, one I will remember for the rest of my life. I said I was coming for it, and once I set my mind on something, I’m a dog with a bone.
“I want to give a huge shoutout to my family, friends, coaches, fans, sponsors and haters, all of whom helped this lift be possible.”
Björnsson​ had previously shared his training experience on his YouTube channel.
In 2018, he was named the World’s Strongest Man. He finished silver at the contest in the past two years.
In 2017, Björnsson – who played The Mountain from season four onwards –​ told Entertainment Weekly about the bizarre requests he kept receiving from fans of Game of Thrones.
One viewer asked him to “squeeze [their] eyes out” in reference to a famous season four scene in which his character is shown doing exactly this to another.
“That’s very popular,” he added. “Or pick them up over my head. But the most popular is to squeeze their eyes out.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Game of Thrones’ ‘The Mountain’ breaks deadlift world record; ‘7-figure’ boxing match next</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, better known as Gregor Clegane or “The Mountain” in Game of Thrones, is a very strong individual.
Having already won the Arnold Strongman Classic and the World’s Strongest Man, among many other competitions, the 31-year-old has also now broken another world record.
After initial reps of 420 kg and 465 kg, Björnsson deadlifted 501 kg to go past a record that has held through since 2016. The 6-foot-9 Icelandic strongman beat the previous record set by the UK’s Eddie Hall, who was the first to ever deadlift 500 kg.
Interestingly enough, Björnsson also wants to KO the previous record holder next, saying he’s signed a very lucrative offer for a boxing match with Hall.
“Something new and big,” Thor said when asked what was next for him. “Core Sports just offered me a seven-figure contract, the biggest contract of my life. I’ve signed it already.
“Hall has been running his mouth for some weeks, and I know he got the same deal, same contract. So Eddie, I just knocked out your record, and now I’m ready to knock you out in the ring,” Björnsson said. “Time to put your fists where your big mouth is, and sign the Core Sports contract. I’m ready.”
Björnsson, who is also a former professional basketball player, did dabble with some martial arts training in the past. In 2015, the massive athlete was also on camera having a friendly sparring match with Conor McGregor in Ireland.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Game of Thrones' actor Hafthór Björnsson breaks deadlifting world record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In an electric display of power, Icelandic strongman and Game of Thrones actor Hafþór (Hafthor) Björnsson broke the deadlift world record Saturday, picking up 501 kilograms (nearly 1,105 pounds) of weight.
Björnsson, who played Ser Gregor Clegane aka The Mountain on Game of Thrones, made his deadlift world record attempt on Saturday, which was broadcast live on ESPN and streamed on YouTube. The previous record was set at 500 kilograms (about 1,102 pounds) by Eddie Hall in 2016.
The record-breaking lift is incredible to watch. His form from the start to the end is spectacular and his lockout at the top is uncharacteristically stable. Many lifters would wobble when attempting a personal record, but the 31-year-old looks like a rock.
The lifting event took place in Iceland, which with its small population of just 364,000, has been operating on lighter social distancing measures than other European countries. (Gatherings of more than 20 are banned through Monday; it's unclear exactly how many attended this event, but in footage, the gym looks sparsely populated.) The country has recorded only 10 COVID-19 deaths; Iceland implemented mass testing and contact tracing early on. Before Björnsson took the stage, event commentators described the attempt as something to look forward to amid the coronavirus crisis.
Before hitting the record, Björnsson warmed up by lifting 420 kilograms (roughly 926 pounds) and 465 kilograms (approximately 1,025 pounds), which means he pulled up a grand total of 1,386 kilograms (nearly 3,056 pounds) over three rounds that day.
After breaking the world record and taking a few minutes to kiss his wife, catch his breath, and cool down, Björnsson said in an interview that he was thankful he had the opportunity to attempt this record despite everything that's going on in the world. 
"Not only did I pull this incredible weight, but I also just feel great afterwards," he said, noting that he didn't get any injuries. "I believe today I could have done more but what's the point? I'm happy with this."
Björnsson also holds the world record for the elephant bar deadlift, which is the same lift but with a longer barbell, and won the World's Strongest Man competition in 2018.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">While live sports are at a standstill as present as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, that didn't stop 'Game of Thrones' star Hafthor Björnsson from writing his name into the record books on Saturday.
According to the ESPN website, Björnsson, who played Ser Gregor Clegane aka "The Mountain" on the hit show, deadlifted a record 1 104 pounds (501kg) at his Iceland home.
Björnsson, 31, beat the previous record of 1 102 pounds (500kg), set by England's Eddie Hall in 2016.
The 6-foot-9, 441-pound (200kg) Björnsson won the World's Strongest Man title in 2018 and has finished in the top three on seven other occasions.
He has also been Iceland's Strongest Man for nine straight years and won Europe's Strongest Man each of the past three years.
The deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips, perpendicular to the floor, before being placed back on the ground. It is one of the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and bench press.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Games of Thrones' Hafthor Bjornsson Smahes World Deadlift Record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">“Game of Thrones” actor best known to fans as favorite Ser Gregor “The Mountain” Clegane, Hafthor Björnsson, crushed the world record on Saturday by deadlifting 1,104 lbs. (501kg).
Björnsson, who stands 6 feet, 9 inches tall and weighs 450 pounds, set the new record for deadlifting (a lift made from a standing position in which a loaded barbell or bar is raised off the ground to the level of the hips) at his home gym in Reykjavík, Iceland.
Watch the incredible lift below:
Björnsson warmed up by deadlifting 926 pounds (420kg), then on his next set deadlifted 1,025 pounds (465kg) for his second attempt before the record attempt at 1,104 pound (501kg). He took 15 minutes between each lift.
Former deadlift champion and 2017 World’s Strongest Man winner Eddie Hall — who set the record previously in 2016 — had earlier disputed the event “in [Björnsson’s] home gym with a bunch of [his] pals.”
“I genuinely look forward to having my record broken & seeing what is possible,” Hall wrote in an Instagram post. “I think you are probably the man to do it, there’s no denying that & I’ll still shake your hand afterwards and say well done… if you do it under the appropriate conditions.”
After besting Hall’s record, Björnsson had a message for him: “Eddie, I know I just knocked out your record. Now I’m ready to knock you out in the ring. Time to put your fists where your big mouth is and sign the Core Sports contract.”
To conclude his run as “The Mountain,” whom Björnsson had portrayed since Season 4, on the fifth episode of the show’s eighth and final season, fans finally got the fight they had been waiting for.
Known as “CleganeBowl,” the episode saw The Mountain go mano-a-mano with his brother Sandor, aka “The Hound,” in a brutal action-packed brawl that saw the brothers fighting to the death high atop the Red Keep in Kings Landing. The Hound threw himself onto The Mountain through a cracked stone wall, and they both fell to their deaths in the fiery wreckage below.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Hafthor Bjornsson, better known as Ser Gregor Clegane or the Mountain on “Game of Thrones”, just set a new world record.
During a livestream on Saturday, Bjornsson lifted 1,104 pounds at Thor’s Power Gym in Iceland.
The previous deadlift world record was held by Eddie Hall in 2016 for lifting 1,102 pounds.
“I have no words. What an amazing day, one I will remember for the rest of my life. I said I was coming for it, and once I set my mind on something, I’m a dog with a bone. I want to give a huge shoutout to my family, friends, coaches, fans, sponsors and haters, all of whom helped this lift be possible,” he wrote on Instagram.
He also won the World’s Strongest Man competition in 2018.
The Mountain was first played by Conan Stevens and Ian Whyte until Bjornsson took over in season 4 of the hit HBO show.

    <h5 class="mb-1">He really is The Mountain! 6ft 9ins Game of Thrones star Hafþór Björnsson breaks the world deadlifting record by lifting 1,104lbs - and thinks he could have shifted MORE if he'd had a crowd</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Game of Thrones star Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson has broken the world deadlift record at an event held in Iceland.
Incredible footage shows the 31-year-old actor lifting a whopping 1,104 pounds (501 kg) off the ground inside Thor's Power Gym in Reykjavík on Saturday.
Björnsson  - who is best known for playing Ser Gregor 'The Mountain' Clegane on the hit HBO series - has now smashed a record previously set by Briton Eddie Hall. 
Back in 2016,  Hall made international headlines after he lifted 1,102 pounds (500 kg). 
Björnsson's deadlift was streamed live on ESPN Saturday, with footage showing him lifting a barbell that was bending and straining under the massive amount of weights. 
The star held the barbell for two seconds before letting go and roaring in delight.
The event took place without a crowd, due to current restrictions on large gatherings that have been put in place due to the coronavirus outbreak. 
In Iceland, no more than 20 people can currently gather in one place. 
Björnsson only completed the deadlift in the company of his doctor, referee and film crew.  
Afterward he told ESPN: 'I'm obviously speechless..'I'm over the moon.'
Björnsson even bragged that he could possibly lift even more weight if he had a crowd. 
He previously told the New York Post that he performs 'maybe 10 percent better in a competition — the crowd gives you that adrenaline rush that you need'.
But the strongman was simply happy to take the world record.  
He stated on Saturday: 'I'm standing here, tall, feeling good, no injuries. I'm healthy as well. I believe today I could have done more, but what's the point? I'm happy with this.'
Bjornsson, who is six feet and nine inches tall, won the World's Strongest Man competition in 2018.
 He played 'The Mountain' - a famous knight loyal to the Lannisters - on Game of Thrones between seasons four and eight. His character was killed in the penultimate episode of the series.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Game of Thrones star Hafthor Julius Bjornsson smashes deadlift world record</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Game of Thrones star Hafthor Julius Bjornsson has set a new world record by deadlifting 501kg (1,105lbs) at his gym in Iceland.
The Icelandic strongman, who played the Mountain in the smash-hit HBO series, broke the previous record held by Brit Eddie Hall.
It has taken four years for someone to beat Hall’s effort, with Bjornsson lifting just 1kg more than his rival.
The coronavirus pandemic meant Bjornsson had to attempt the world record at his gym and seek official recognition for the lift as it was out of competition.
Magnus Ver Magnusson officiated the deadlift after two successful warm-ups at 420kg and 460kg.
Bjornsson, who has one World’s Strongest Man title, was elated after he managed to break the record.
He said: ‘I’m absolutely speechless, so happy and thankful. Blessed. Everything went according to plans, I’m over the moon.
‘I believe today I could’ve done more, but what’s the point? I’m happy with this.’
The world record attempt attracted controversy and Bjornsson is now eager to settle his rivalry with Hall in a boxing match.
‘Wow… something new and big,’ Bjornsson said when asked what was next.
‘Core Sports just offered me a seven figure contract, which is the biggest contract of my life. I’ve signed it already.
‘Eddie Hall has been running his mouth for two weeks now and I now that he got the same deal.
‘So Eddie, I just knocked out your record, and now I’m ready to knock you out in the ring.
‘Time to put your fists where your big mouth is and sign the Core Sports contract.
‘I’m ready. Are you ready, Eddie?’

And here's the world-record lift:
Bjornsson, speaking on the ESPN telecast, said he was pleased with his lift — and that he could have done more.
"Not only did I pull this incredible weight, I also feel great afterwards," Bjornsson said. "I’m standing here, tall, feeling good. No injuries. So I’m healthy as well. I believe today I could have done more, but what’s the point? I’m happy with this. My family and friends, they’re happy. And I’ve decided to call it."
Bjornsson also called out Hall to a boxing match — not the first time they. have hinted at a fight — after breaking the record.
"I just knocked out your record and now I’m ready to knock you out in the ring," Bjornsson said. "Time to put your fist where your big mouth is and sign the CoreSports contract. I’m ready. Are you ready, Eddie?"
Hall, to his credit, wished Bjornsson luck ahead of his world-record attempt.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">KOPAVOGUR, Iceland (AP) — The Mountain is at the top of the deadlift world.
“Game of Thrones” actor Hafthor Bjornsson, who played Gregor “The Mountain” Clegane in the HBO series, set a deadlift world record by lifting 501 kilograms (1,104 pounds) on Saturday.
Bjornsson, the 2018 World’s Strongest Man, made the successful attempt at Thor’s Power Gym in his native Iceland.
“I believe today I could’ve done more, but what’s the point?” the 31-year-old Bjornsson told ESPN. “I’m happy with this.”
Eddie Hall set the previous record in 2016 at the World Deadlift Championships, with the Englishman lifting 500 kilos (1,102 pounds).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Teams worried about coronavirus affecting older staff</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NBA will have to decide who is considered essential game staff should play resume amid the coronavirus pandemic, ESPN reported.
One of the concerns weighing on NBA teams is the age of people typically deemed essential to a team, such as a member of the coaching staff or a general manager, or whether they have a preexisting medical condition.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified people 65 or older or people of any age with an underlying medical condition as being more susceptible to COVID-19.
“Based on all the information that we have today, probably people over 60 with preexisting conditions can’t go, for sure, no matter what their titles are,” one unidentified general manager told ESPN. “Whether it’s a father of the star player or whether it’s the general manager of the team, they can’t go there.”
Currently, there are six NBA head coaches who are 60 and older, with three 65 and older: Alvin Gentry, New Orleans Pelicans, 65; Mike D’Antoni, Houston Rockets, 68; and Gregg Popovich, San Antonio Spurs, 71.
Who will be determined essential will lead to tough choices and the potential for hurt feelings, but general managers told ESPN medical staff likely won’t be cut.
“The one area you don’t want to skimp on is the medical. The coaching part of it, you could probably get by with a head coach, that’s it,” one general manager said.
As of Saturday, nearly 1.1 million people in the United States had been diagnosed with the coronavirus, with 64,283 deaths.

    <h5 class="mb-1">ESPN Analyst Is Fed Up With 1 QB Comparison For Jalen Hurts</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A veteran ESPN NFL analyst is fed up with one common quarterback comparison for Eagles rookie Jalen Hurts.
Hurts was one of the most-surprising picks in the NFL Draft last week when the Philadelphia Eagles selected him in Round 2. Most did not expect the NFC East franchise to take a quarterback so early since Carson Wentz is still relatively young.
Philadelphia loved Hurts, though, and reportedly plans on using him in multiple ways. The former Oklahoma and Alabama quarterback has drawn comparisons to Taysom Hill.
Hill, who signed a two-year extension in New Orleans this offseason, plays several roles for the Saints. He’s a backup quarterback but he’s also been used on special teams and as a wide receiver and running back.
ESPN analyst Louis Riddick says Hurts is not Hill, though. He’s had enough of that comparison.
“Jalen Hurts is not Taysom Hill. He will not be a PP on punt team. He will not be blocking punts. He will not cover kicks. He will be trained as a QB. In a proven system. By a SB winning HC. In a system that will provide him continuity from one season to the next. Ideal for him,” Riddick wrote on Twitter.
Hill has developed into a good NFL player, but Hurts is a pretty different player. Maybe he’ll be used in a couple of different ways, but outside of occasionally lining up in the backfield or out wide, he’ll just be a quarterback.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bears decline fifth-year option on Mitchell Trubisky, says report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Chicago Bears have declined the fifth-year option on the rookie contract of quarterback Mitchell Trubisky, NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported on Saturday.
Trubisky’s deal is set to expire at the end of the 2020 season, and in that campaign he will have to compete with Nick Foles – acquired from the Jacksonville Jaguars in March – for practice repetitions and the starting job.
Trubisky will be playing for his next contract – whether it is in Chicago or elsewhere.
The Bears traded up from the third pick to number two overall in the 2017 draft to select Trubisky out of North Carolina, but he has failed to live up to his draft status.
The success of Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson, who were drafted later in the first round, has added to the pain felt by Chicago supporters.
Trubisky started 14 games in 2018 with a 95.4 passer rating, helped lead the Bears to a playoff berth and was selected to the Pro Bowl.
He regressed last year, posting an 83.0 passer rating and seeing a drop-off in his completion percentage, yards and touchdowns, prompting Chicago to trade a fourth-round draft pick for Foles.
Trubisky was the first draft pick made by general manager Ryan Pace and was hailed as the foundation of a rebuild in the mould of the New Orleans Saints, for whom Pace had worked previously.
With the deadline to decide on fifth-year options for the 2017 draft class coming on Monday, that crop of players has come under the microscope in recent days.
While Mahomes, drafted number 12 overall, has been the crown jewel of the class, Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett is the only top-five pick to have his fifth-year option picked up.
Earlier this week, the San Francisco 49ers declined their option on defensive lineman Solomon Thomas, as did the Jaguars with running back Leonard Fournette and the Tennessee Titans with wide receiver Corey Davis.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Chicago Bears have declined the fifth-year option on quarterback Mitchell Trubisky for the 2021 season, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Saturday.
The second overall pick of the 2017 NFL draft, Trubisky finished last season 28th in Total QBR (39.4), tied for 27th in touchdown passes (17), and was 21st in passing yards (3,138), 32nd in yards gained per pass attempt (6.1) and 28th in traditional quarterback rating (83.0).
Trubisky, 25, will earn $4.423 million in 2020 and count $9.237 million against the salary cap.
The Bears, who went 8-8 and failed to reach the playoffs last season, acquired quarterback Nick Foles in a trade with the Jacksonville Jaguars in March.
Bears general manager Ryan Pace said last month that Trubisky and Foles will compete for the starting job in 2020.
"We've increased competition at a critical position and we talked to both players, and the way we view this is it's an open competition," Pace said on April 3. "And credit to both those guys for embracing it."
Pace traded up a spot with San Francisco in 2017 to draft Trubisky ahead of quarterbacks Patrick Mahomes (Kansas City) and Deshaun Watson (Houston).
Trubisky underwent surgery in January to repair a partially torn labrum in his left shoulder and is expected to be medically cleared by the summer. He suffered the labrum tear and dislocated his non-throwing shoulder in Week 4 against the Minnesota Vikings, but he missed just one game.
The Bears traded their 2020 fourth-round compensatory draft pick to the Jaguars for Foles and, in the process, inherited a contract that included about $21 million in guarantees. Foles, 31, later restructured the deal to allow him to void either of the final two years, depending on the upside of his performance.
In 2018, Matt Nagy's first season as head coach, the Bears went 12-4 as Trubisky passed for 3,223 yards, 24 touchdowns and 12 interceptions and rushed for 421 yards and three touchdowns. He played in the Pro Bowl after that season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">This stat shows how terrible the Jaguars have been at drafting in the first round</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Jaguars reportedly declined running back Leonard Fournette's fifth-year option on Friday, continuing a miserable trend of missteps regarding the franchise's first-round selections.
Jacksonville hasn't exercised the fifth-year option for any of its first-round picks dating back to the 2011 NFL Draft, which was the first to include the option per the 2011 NFL collective bargaining agreement. That includes seven straight top-10 picks, and six in the top five.
Those picks are comprised of two quarterbacks, a receiver, offensive tackle, defensive end, cornerback and running back. Here's what that looks like, per analyst Warren Sharp:
MORE: Ramsey offers advice to Fournette, adding more drama to Jags' offseason
So, yeah. Not great.
It's worth noting that Ramsey's talent was worth such a high pick; but injury issues in 2019 raised questions of his long-term future with the team, leading to a heated confrontation with coach Doug Marrone in Week 2. He was "overjoyed"to be traded from the team.
Regarding Fournette: The Jaguars are considering him a potential trade option despite him compiling 2,631 rushing yards and 1,009 receiving yards in three seasons — including an injury-shortened sophomore campaign. Otherwise, Fournette has two 1,000-yard rushing seasons, the latest of which saw him average 4.3 yards per carry and total 1,674 yards from scrimmage. Jacksonville signed running back Chris Thompson to a one-year deal on Friday as well.
Regardless of the Jaguars' plan for Fournette — whether they let him finish his contract with the team or trade him away — it just shows how poorly the team has managed not only the NFL Draft, but also its players. The Jags seem to have broken that trend with the selection of Pro Bowl linebacker Josh Allen in 2019, but there's still another player up — defensive tackle Taven Bryan — to determine if the team's unenviable streak continues another year.
Considering how badly current Jags players want out of Jacksonville, that streak might continue another season before Allen can finally end it.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Report: Bears declining Mitchell Trubisky’s fifth-year option</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Chicago Bears will not pick up the fifth-year option on quarterback Mitchell Trubisky’s rookie contract, according to NFL Network‘s Tom Pelissero.
The decision means Trubisky is currently slated to become an unrestricted free agent after the 2020 season.
Trubisky is the just the latest top-five pick from the 2017 draft to have their option declined, as only Myles Garrett has had his picked up by the Cleveland Browns.
The 25-year-old Trubisky was the first quarterback selected in the 2017 draft as the Bears traded up one spot to select the North Carolina pivot second overall. The selection of Trubisky, however, has garnered plenty of criticism in the years since as both Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson were picked afterwards, 10th and 12th, respectively.
General manager Ryan Pace largely staked his reputation to Trubisky when he traded up a spot with San Francisco to draft him ahead of Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes and Houston’s Deshaun Watson. While Mahomes and Watson have emerged as two of the NFL’s best quarterbacks, Trubisky has mixed promising flashes with too many poor decisions and throws. And he is facing a murky future in Chicago.
Chicago lacked playmakers to complement receiver Allen Robinson and got little production from its tight ends. It addressed that issue by signing five-time Pro Bowl tight end Jimmy Graham in March and drafting Notre Dame’s Cole Kmet in the second round last month.
Trubisky had a typically tough rookie campaign in 2017, but played better in 2018 under new head coach Matt Nagy as the Bears went 12-4 (11-3 with Trubisky under centre) and Chicago made the post-season for the first time since 2010. However, Trubisky and the Bears regressed in 2019, finishing outside of the playoffs with an 8-8 record and an offence that ranked 25th out of 32.
In response, the Bears acquired Super Bowl LII MVP Nick Foles in a trade with the Jacksonville Jaguars this off-season and declared the two quarterbacks would battle it out for next season’s starting spot.
As mentioned above, Pelissero reports the Bears have been impressed with Trubisky’s response to the Foles acquisition.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jeff Smith edged out Ricky Evans in a final-match decider to top the PDC Home Tour’s Group 16 on Saturday night.
Evans needed to win by three legs or more to top the group and led 3-2 after coming from behind.
But the contest went to a decider and Smith produced a 147 checkout that also ended the hopes of Martin Atkins, who would have finished top if Evans had won 5-3 or 5-4 after a tight battle also involving Germany’s Christian Bunse.
“I didn’t really have much choice,” Smith said of his final flourish. “It was great darts again. Ricky put up a good fight but I’ll take that win every day.
“That’s how tight the PDC is. There are 128 players and every single player can beat you. I thought I was gone when I lost against Martin but Christian, thank you very much, and let’s keep going.”
Smith opened his night with a convincing 5-1 win over Bunse, sealing victory with a 10-dart finish on the bullseye, but was then beaten 5-4 by Atkins, who had himself opened with a 5-2 victory over Evans.
Evans rebounded with victory over Bunse as gremlins hit the broadcast. Technical issues meant coverage was lost for around 10 minutes, with Evans 3-0 up on Bunse when normal service was resumed.
The German reduced the deficit to 3-1 and then took the next two legs to level the contest, only for Evans to regain his composure and wrap up a 5-3 victory.
Bunse belatedly found form in the next game as he took a 5-2 victory over Atkins that left the door open for Smith.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The US will likely see the return of NASCAR and the PGA before football, basketball, and hockey amid the coronavirus pandemic. Here's why., Business Insider - Business Insider Singapore</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dr. Anthony Fauci said it might be challenging for major sports to return in the US this year.
“Safety, for the players and for the fans, trumps everything,” he told the New York Times on Tuesday. “If you can’t guarantee safety, then, unfortunately, you’re going to have to bite the bullet and say, ‘We may have to go without this sport for this season.'”
While the option to live-stream events makes eliminating fans easy, there’s no way around the fact that the new coronavirus typically spreads when droplets pass between people in sustained, close proximity. What’s more, experts have discovered that between 25% and 50% of people infected with COVID-19 show no symptoms when they’re infections.
So unless athletes who play football, basketball, baseball, soccer, and hockey – all contact sports, really – and their support staff test negative before competing in games, it’s impossible to eliminate the risk of the virus spreading during sporting events.
And right now, according to Fauci, the US doesn’t have the testing capability to make that a reality.
“I would love to be able to have all sports back,” Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said. “But as a health official and a physician and a scientist, I have to say, right now, when you look at the country, we’re not ready for that yet.”
At the beginning of the US’s outbreak, the lack of available testing ruffled feathers. Celebrities and athletes jumped the testing lines amid harsh criticism. On March 11, the state of Oklahoma used 60% of its testing capacity on NBA players and team staff after a member of the Utah Jazz tested positive, allowing them to bypass the long waits endured by ordinary citizens waiting for tests.
Now, more than 6.5 million Americans have been tested so far for the coronavirus; the US testing-per-capita rate is among the highest in the world. But given the country’s staggering case count and dearth of commensurate tests, still not every American who wants a test can get one.
This raises issues for professional leagues who may want to use widespread testing among their teams to clear athletes to play. Team commissioners and owners said they don’t want to secure tests for players in the current environment, AP reported Friday.
“We would have to ensure that testing is widely available and front-line health care workers have access before we begin talking about regular testing in the context of professional sports,” NBA spokesman Mike Bass told AP.
The number of tests needed to get professional contact sports going is staggering. About 3,000 kits would need to be available for Major League Baseball players, staff, and broadcasters for every round of testing, AP reported. Even if the National Hockey League and NBA returned with a smaller number of teams for their respective postseasons, those leagues would likely need 1,000 tests each time. And there’s no metric in place for how often these rounds of tests would need to happen (plus, some test results can take one to two days).
And even if teams were able to obtain the number of necessary tests without taking them away from Americans who needed them, players and staff would steal need to aggressively isolate themselves from society, Fauci said.
“You’ve got to be really creative. That’s going to be more difficult and more problematic,” he told the New York Times.
If teams are going to play contact sports without an audience, according to Fauci, it would be important “to test all the players and make sure they’re negative and keep them in a place where they don’t have contact with anybody on the outside who you don’t know whether they’re positive or negative.”
He added: “In other words, we said that for baseball, get the players in Major League Baseball, get a couple of cities and a couple of hotels, get them tested and keep them segregated. I know it’s going to be difficult for them not to be out in society, but that may be the price you pay if you want to play ball.”
And not all ballplayers are on board with that idea.
“What are you going to do with family members?” Mike Trout, the Los Angeles Angels outfielder, asked during an NBC Sports Network interview.
“My wife is pregnant, what am I going to do when she goes into labor? Am I going to have to quarantine for two weeks after I come back? Because obviously I can’t miss that birth of our first child. So, there’s a lot of red flags, there’s a lot of questions,” Trout said.
Some sports like golf and NASCAR racing, which are better suited to social distancing, could return sooner amid the coronavirus pandemic – even without testing. Golfers could stagger their tee times on courses and walk solo between holes; NASCAR racers already compete individually in their respective cars.
The PGA announced in April it hoped to restart in two months’ time, according to ESPN, though its chief of operations Tyler Dennis said it hadn’t yet determined how much coronavirus testing might be needed for golfers.
On Thursday, NASCAR announced it would return to live racing (with fans, of course) on May 17 in South Carolina, the Wall Street Journal reported. Attendees will have their temperatures checked and the use of protective equipment and social distancing measures will be required at the venue.
But NASCAR will not be testing drivers and their staff.
“Those tests remain in short supply,” NASCAR vice president of racing operations John Bobo told AP. “Getting results can take two to three days. Really, those tests should be targeted for people most in need.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roma chief sends message to Man Utd over Chris Smalling transfer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">AS Roma manager Paulo Fonseca says the club are keen on securing on-loan Manchester United defender Chris Smalling on a permanent transfer this summer.
The centre-back has impressed on his season-long loan in the Serie A, making 21 league appearances before the season was postponed over the coronavirus crisis.
Smalling has been at Old Trafford since 2010, but his spot in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s side was lost to the world’s most expensive defender, Harry Maguire.
With the 30-year-old’s stay in Italy due to come to an end, Fonseca wants to keep one of the ‘leaders of the dressing room’ around for longer.
‘I will do everything I can to keep him at Roma next year too.I know he wants to stay, let’s see what happens,’ he told ESPN.
‘He’s an amazing man, so humble, so professional.
‘He is adored by the fans and established himself as one of the leaders in the dressing room.
‘It’s not easy for English central defenders to adapt so quickly to Italian football, the record there isn’t good. But he has been amazing.’
United are in the market for another centre-back to pair up with Maguire in defence, with RB Leipzig’s Ibrahima Konate the latest to be linked with a move to Old Trafford.
According to Le 10 Sport, the Red Devils have reportedly made contact with the 20-year-old’s agent to enquire about a potential summer transfer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roma want to keep "amazing" Chris Smalling next season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roma head coach Paulo Fonseca says he's determined to keep Chris Smalling at the club for at least one more season.
The England defender has impressed while on loan from Manchester United this term, making 28 appearances and helping the club keep nine clean sheets. Smalling's form has put in line for a recall to Gareth Southgate's England squad while United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has hinted that he return to Old Trafford for the 2021 campaign.
Fonseca says 30-year-old Smalling, who has two years remaining on his United contract, has been "amazing" and has become a leader in their dressing room.
"I will do everything I can to keep him at Roma next year too," the Roma boss told ESPN. "I know he wants to stay, let's see what happens.
"He's an amazing man, so humble, so professional. He is adored by the fans and established himself as one of the leaders in the dressing room.
"It's not easy for English central defenders to adapt so quickly to Italian football, the record there isn't good. But he has been amazing."
Meanwhile Fonseca is backing young midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo to become one of the best players in Europe:
"He's not just a wonderful natural talent, he's a player who improved considerably this year. I used to say he was like a wild man, following his instincts, but now he understands the game, understands the space, understands the decision-making.
"I have no doubt that in a few years he'll be one of the best players not just in Italy but in all of Europe."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Roma give transfer update on Manchester United defender Chris Smalling</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roma head coach Paulo Fonseca says he is doing everything he can to try and extend Chris Smalling's stay with the club.
The Manchester United defender is on loan for the 2019/20 season and has impressed in Serie A.
A deal is yet to have been agreed by the clubs over a potential permanent deal for the 30-year-old, but Fonseca says Smalling wants to stay in Rome, and he is trying to secure a deal.
"I will do everything I can to keep him at Roma next year too," Fonseca told ESPN. "I know he wants to stay, let's see what happens.
"He's an amazing man, so humble, so professional. He is adored by the fans and established himself as one of the leaders in the dressing room.
"It's not easy for English central defenders to adapt so quickly to Italian football, the record there isn't good. But he has been amazing."
Smalling did not play in Roma's opening four games of the season, but has gone on to feature heavily in Serie A since.
He still has two years remaining on his contract at Old Trafford, but is said to have settled well in Italy. Whether United will be tempted to agree to a permanent deal is another matter.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘I know he wants to stay’ – €20m+ Man Utd loanee’s current boss will push for permanent deal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roma boss Paulo Fonseca has insisted that he will do all he can to ensure Chris Smalling seals a permanent switch from Man Utd when his loan deal ends.
The 30-year-old joined the Giallorossi on a season-long loan deal last summer, and after a slow start to life at the Stadio Olimpico, he has established himself as a key figure in the side.

Brought in to help fill the void left behind by Kostas Manolas, Smalling has made 28 appearances so far this season with Roma continuing to challenge for a top-four finish in Serie A as they hope to book their spot in the Champions League next year.
With the season currently on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic, it remains to be seen if they go on to do so, but Fonseca has seemingly seen enough from Smalling already to be convinced that he wants him on a permanent basis while he has insisted that the England international wants to stay in Rome too.
“I will do everything I can to keep him at Roma next year too,” Fonseca told ESPN. “I know he wants to stay, let’s see what happens.
“He’s an amazing man, so humble, so professional. He is adored by the fans and established himself as one of the leaders in the dressing room.
“It’s not easy for English central defenders to adapt so quickly to Italian football, the record there isn’t good. But he has been amazing.”
La Gazzetta dello Sport add that Man Utd are said to want between €20m-€25m to green light a permanent exit for Smalling, and it’s suggested that it could be difficult for Roma to meet those demands.
In turn, it remains to be seen if the two clubs can reach a compromise, particularly with the negative financial impact the coronavirus pandemic is having and will continue to have in the months ahead, but what is clear at this stage is the will of both the player and his current club wanting a permanent deal.
With Harry Maguire, Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly at his disposal currently, United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer may well feel as though they can afford to let Smalling go, but that doesn’t necessarily guarantee an agreement on his valuation.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Fonseca 'will do everything' to keep Smalling at Roma</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Roma coach Paulo Fonseca insisted he would be trying everything to keep defender Chris Smalling at the Serie A club.
Smalling, 30, has impressed on loan at Roma from Manchester United this season, but reports suggest they may be unable to afford the transfer fee for the centre-back despite wanting to keep him.
But Fonseca is eager to keep the 31-time England international, praising his impact in Rome.
"I will do everything I can to keep him at Roma next year too. I know he wants to stay, let's see what happens," he told ESPN on Friday.
"He's an amazing man, so humble, so professional. He is adored by the fans and established himself as one of the leaders in the dressing room.
"It's not easy for English central defenders to adapt so quickly to Italian football, the record there isn't good, but he has been amazing."
Smalling had made 28 appearances in all competitions for Roma before the season was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Broncos RB Phillip Lindsay Shares Honest Reaction To Melvin Gordon Signing</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Denver Broncos’ decision to sign Melvin Gordon in free agency all but assures a reduced workload for starting running back Phillip Lindsay.
Understandably, Lindsay isn’t especially thrilled at the idea – especially since he’s still on an undrafted rookie salary. He admitted as much in a recent Instagram Live conversation.
But upon reflection, Lindsay now realizes that teaming up with Melvin Gordon could be a benefit. Lindsay said that while he was “really upset at the beginning,” he now believes that he can Gordon can be “a helluva tandem.”
“When I wasn’t in the game, stuff was not going as well or smooth,” Lindsay said. “But if you have somebody that can compliment me like I did my rookie year where I’m not just running up the middle trying to get first downs all day. I was like, ‘Okay this takes some pressure off me Now I can do my job and use my speed and do my stuff and stay healthier too.'”
After a historic rookie season in 2018, Lindsay posted nearly identical numbers in 2019 but the offense as a whole struggled.
That could all change in 2020 after the recent moves they’ve made. They bolstered their offensive line in free agency and drafted three wide receivers, including star wideout Jerry Jeudy.
The Broncos finished 28th in points and yards in 2019. With the moves they’ve made, they could be in line for a big improvement in 2020.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Andy Dalton blames messy Bengals exit for free-agency limbo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Dalton isn’t ripping the Bengals. It’s not his style. But the three-time Pro Bowl quarterback is clearly not thrilled with how his exit – or his final year in Cincinnati – played out.
Though it was obvious Dalton wasn’t going to be kept around after he was benched midway through the season and the team zeroed in on LSU star Joe Burrow with the first pick in the NFL Draft, he wasn’t officially let go until Thursday. And it may have hurt his chances to latch onto a new team that would’ve given him an opportunity to start.
“This year there were a good amount of quarterbacks that were available,” Dalton told the Bengals’ official website. “I think it would have worked out differently if I had been a free agent when the new league year started. I was still under contract and that hurt me.”
Dalton, 32, had been with the Bengals since 2011, when they took him with the 35th pick in the draft out of TCU. He led them to five straight playoff appearances from 2011-15, but his run came to an end last year as Cincinnati bottomed out and he threw 14 interceptions, compared to just 16 touchdowns, in 13 games. Dalton was benched just before the trade deadline and later led the Bengals to their only two wins of the year. He believed teams were in inclined to trade for him this offseason because they knew Cincinnati would eventually release him.
“I’m sure teams knew they [the Bengals] were going to take a quarterback No. 1 and they would release me and there was no reason to rush into anything,” Dalton said.
The situation was frustrating, since had he known earlier that the Bengals wanted to move on from him, he could’ve caught on somewhere else.
“I wish if [coach Zac Taylor] was thinking about it at least let me try to see if I could end up somewhere else or at least see if there’s interest in possibly getting traded,” Dalton told ESPN in October. “At that point, the way it was handled, there wasn’t enough time to even have that happen.”
The NFL Network reported Thursday that the Jaguars have “legitimate interest” in Dalton. The Patriots also appear to be a potential landing spot. Dalton was due to earn $17.7 million in 2020, the final season of a six-year contract extension he signed in August 2014.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Bengals QB Andy Dalton Shares Advice For Joe Burrow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Cincinnati Bengals unofficially named Joe Burrow the starting quarterback for the 2020 season when they released Andy Dalton on Thursday. It marked the end of the TCU product’s long tenure with the franchise.
Dalton led the Bengals to a handful of playoff appearances, but the team just couldn’t get over the hump. Perhaps that will change now that Burrow is leading the charge.
Although he didn’t owe his former team anything, Dalton felt the need to share some advice to Burrow. It’s a classy move from the veteran quarterback, especially since he was just released by Cincinnati.
While there’s no doubt that Burrow will enter his rookie season with a ton of pressure on his shoulders, the message he received from Dalton could help his approach throughout this fall.
Here’s the advice that Dalton has for Burrow, via the team’s official website:
Dalton isn’t the only quarterback to give advice to Burrow. Earlier this week, former No. 1 pick David Carr had a few words of wisdom to share for the former Heisman Trophy winner.
Carr talked about the importance of speaking up and learn which plays he’s most comfortable running.
We’ll see if Burrow can handle sky-high expectations in Cincinnati as a rookie.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former LSU running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire can thank Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes for his role in helping him land the No. 32 pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.
While speaking to reporters Friday, Mahomes revealed that General Manager Brett Veach unexpectedly texted him after the draft started to ask him what three players he would want on the team -- and Edwards-Helaire was the first name the Super Bowl Champ mentioned.
JAGUARS’ K’LAVON CHAISSON WANTS FORMER LSU TEAMMATE JOE BURROW TO BE FIRST SACK: I’LL ‘TAKE THAT FINE’
“I wanted to add to the offense, obviously to help me out and to help our team out. So, Clyde was the first name that came to mind and I know we have a great running back room already, so I think just bringing him in, I know he’ll fit right in and he’ll compete,” Mahomes said, according to Chiefs Wire.
“I think the first thing that stood out from Clyde is when the competition and the games got bigger, it seemed like he played better,” he continued. “I always like guys that can rise to the competition, and whenever you’re on the biggest stage, you play your best football, and you rise up and compete with your team.”
But for Mahomes, Edwards-Helaire offers more than just an advantage on the field.
“You can tell he’s a high-character guy,” Mahomes added. “He loves football.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Biden backs women's soccer team after lawsuit setback</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Saturday voiced his support for the U.S. women’s soccer team, a day after it suffered a setback in its gender discrimination lawsuit against the United States Soccer Federation.
The team’s claims for equal pay were dismissed by a court on Friday, handing a victory to U.S. Soccer.
“Don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet,” Biden wrote in a tweet to the team.
“Equal pay, now. Or else when I’m president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding,” Biden added to the federation.
The former vice president is looking to unseat incumbent Republican Donald Trump in November’s U.S. presidential election.
The World Cup-winning team’s long-running feud with U.S. Soccer has been a very public and bitter battle and the players had been seeking $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act.
On Friday, Judge R. Gary Klausner of the United States District Court for the Central District of California threw out the players’ claims that they were under paid in comparison with the men’s national team.
The court allowed complaints of unfair medical, travel and training to proceed to trial, which is scheduled to begin June 16.
“The WNT (Women’s National Team) has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the MNT (Men’s National Team) over the class period,” the court said in its summary judgment.
U.S. Soccer on Friday said it wanted to work with the team to “chart a positive path forward to grow the game both here at home and around the world.”
The players have said they plan to appeal the court’s decision.
Billie Jean King, who famously battled for equal pay in tennis, also offered words of encouragement to the team on Saturday.
“This is a setback, but it is not the end of the fight,” she wrote on Twitter.
“The pursuit of equality is a marathon not a sprint, and this lawsuit has generated a meaningful conversation about the treatment of women in sports,” she said.
“One ruling does not diminish its impact.”
Last month U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro resigned over language used in a court filing suggesting women possess less ability than men when it comes to soccer.
The language prompted an on-field protest by players, who wore their warmup jerseys inside out to obscure the U.S. Soccer logo prior to a game, and a critical response from several of the team’s commercial sponsors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Pay now': Biden demands US Soccer give its women's national team equal pay or 'go elsewhere for World Cup funding' if he's elected president</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden chimed in on the US Women’s National Team’s ongoing legal battle against the US Soccer Federation concerning unequal pay.
The former vice president wrote on Twitter Saturday afternoon first addressing the four-time World Cup-winning team and sending a warning to US Soccer for “when” he is president.”
“To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet,” Biden wrote. “To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I’m president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding.”
The tweet came one day after US District Judge R. Gary Klausner threw out the team’s lawsuit in which they are seeking $66 million in damages, writing in a 32-page decision that they had the opportunity to be paid in a comparable structure to the Men’s National Team, Insider’s Lauren Frias previously reported.
Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the USWNT, tweeted after the decision that the team was “shocked and disappointed,” but “will not give up our hard work for equal pay.”
“We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender,” she wrote.
“We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them,” Levinson wrote in a later tweet. “We will appeal and press on.”
Klausner did allow claims on discriminatory travel and medical allocations to proceed, which is set to go to trial in mid-June.
The players hope to overturn Klausner’s ruling to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which would delay the trial, according to the Associated Press.
Biden is currently facing his own legal troubles after his former staffer Tara Reade alleged he sexually assaulted her when she was a staffer in 1993. Reade filed a criminal complaint against Biden, who has denied the allegation and asked the secretary of the Senate to locate the alleged harassment complaint.

The Democratic presidential candidate tweeted his support of the athletes on the heels of a federal court ruling in California Friday that swatted away claims the World Cup-winning women are paid less than their male counterparts.
“Don’t give up this fight,” Biden tweeted Saturday. “This is not over yet.”
The former vice president to Barack Obama warned that US Soccer had better level the playing field if they know what’s good for them.
“Equal pay, now,” Biden tweeted. “Or else when I’m president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding.”
The women’s soccer squad plans to appeal the decision by Judge R. Gary Klausner.
“If you know this team at all you know we have a lot of fight left in us,” defender Becky Sauerbrunn wrote on Twitter. “We knew this wasn’t going to be easy, change never is.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Pay now': Biden demands US Soccer give its women's national team equal pay or 'go elsewhere for World Cup funding' if he's elected president</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden chimed in on the US Women’s National Team’s ongoing legal battle against the US Soccer Federation concerning unequal pay.
The former vice president wrote on Twitter Saturday afternoon first addressing the four-time World Cup-winning team and sending a warning to US Soccer for “when” he is president.”
“To @USWNT: don’t give up this fight. This is not over yet,” Biden wrote. “To @USSoccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I’m president, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding.”
The tweet came one day after US District Judge R. Gary Klausner threw out the team’s lawsuit in which they are seeking $US66 million in damages, writing in a 32-page decision that they had the opportunity to be paid in a comparable structure to the Men’s National Team, Insider’s Lauren Frias previously reported.
Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the USWNT, tweeted after the decision that the team was “shocked and disappointed,” but “will not give up our hard work for equal pay.”
“We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender,” she wrote.
“We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them,” Levinson wrote in a later tweet. “We will appeal and press on.”
Klausner did allow claims on discriminatory travel and medical allocations to proceed, which is set to go to trial in mid-June.
The players hope to overturn Klausner’s ruling to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which would delay the trial, according to the Associated Press.
Biden is currently facing his own legal troubles after his former staffer Tara Reade alleged he sexually assaulted her when she was a staffer in 1993. Reade filed a criminal complaint against Biden, who has denied the allegation and asked the secretary of the Senate to locate the alleged harassment complaint.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ahead of UFC 249, ringside physicians revise recommendation to postpone combat sports</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">When the UFC returns to putting on events next week, it looks like they’ll do so without objectively ignoring the recommendations of the Association of Ringside Physicians (ARP). Back in early April, the organization – which provides training and certification for doctors and other medical personnel in combat sports – recommended the postponing of “all combat sporting events” until “further notice.”
However, with UFC 249 on the horizon next Saturday, it looks like “further notice” has arrived. In a recent release to the press, the ARP has revised their recommendation on combat sporting events somewhat. ESPN first published the statement, in which the organization said that while the risk of COVID-19 transmission couldn’t be entirely eliminated, they felt it could be mitigated.
That statement falls short of actually encouraging, or even necessarily embracing, a return to an active combat sports schedule. But, it also clearly makes room for organizations like the UFC, who have the resources to meet any enhanced health and safety guidelines that might be put forth by commissions they operate under, in order to start putting on events again.
With states around the country searching for ways to restart their economies in the coming months, this seems like exactly the kind of message they’re looking for to give backbone to the easing of restrictions on events. And it’s another move that makes it that much more likely the UFC will be able to continue with their 2020 calendar as planned.
UFC 249 is set to take place on Saturday, May 9th, in Jacksonville, FL. The PPV event is expected to be followed quickly by Fight Night cards on May 13th & 16th. Stay tuned to Bloody Elbow for more news and notes in the coming days.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ringside doctors association loosens stance on coronavirus restrictions for combat sports</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Association of Ringside Physicians (ARP) is officially loosening its stance on the current coronavirus restrictions for combat sports, per a statement released by the organization on Saturday (via ESPN).
The announcement comes less than one month after the ARP recommended that all combat sports should be postponed in the light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The advisement was not taken lightly as ARP is responsible for educating, training and certifying ringside physicians around the world.
Now, as many areas in the world begin to flatten the coronavirus curve and seek a return to normalcy, ARP is relaxing its views on current combat sports restrictions as long as promotions are able to host events with extra safety and health precautions in place.
“Although it is impossible to eliminate all risk of COVID19, precautions can be made to reduce the risk of viral transmission,” the ARP statement read. “Many athletic commissions, organizations and promotions are developing new guidelines to limit exposure to all involved at events, including athletes, their teams, commission personnel and support staff.
“Combat sports event procedures regarding COVID19 precautions should be actively developed, regularly reviewed and modified based on the evolving knowledge and scientific evidence put forth by public health authorities. These guidelines should also involve local and regional public health officials as well as infectious disease experts and epidemiologists.”
While Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is already set for its awaited return with UFC 249 on May 9 from Jacksonville, Fla., the new ARP recommendations could pave the way for other major combat organizations to return to action. Of course, those promotions would have to set forth extensive safety precautions to stage any sort of event, which is what UFC is doing in accordance with the Florida State Boxing Commission and local health officials.
If UFC is able to safely host UFC 249 — along with scheduled events on May 13 and May 16 from the same location — it could open the door for the rest of the combat sports world.

    <h5 class="mb-1">With UFC events on horizon, ringside physicians’ group softens stance on COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As portions of the economy begin to reopen and the UFC prepares to restart its event schedule, the Association of Ringside Physicians has softened its stance on holding combat sports events during the COVID-19 pandemic.
In a prepared statement, the ARP on Saturday acknowledged the shifting circumstances around the country on COVID-19 and urged caution as promoters and regulators figure out how to move forward safely.
“Although it is impossible to eliminate all risk associated with COVID-19, precautions can be made to reduce the risk of viral transmission,” the statement read.
This past month, the ARP called for the indefinite suspension of all combat sports events on the same day the UFC announced plans to move forward with UFC 249. The pay-per-view event was later postponed after the promotion’s broadcast partner asked the promotion to “stand down” amid political pressure over plans to hold the event on tribal land in California on April 18.
With several states moving to reopen the economy and the state of Florida green-lighting the regulation of combat sports events, the ARP said regulators are working on plans to limit the exposure of participants. The group urged all stakeholders to base decisions on science.
The foundation for the UFC’s restart was laid by a political act. As state governments around the country moved to restrict nonessential businesses, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared pro wrestling an essential business. The governor’s move arrived the same day a pro-Trump political action committee headed by Linda McMahon, wife of WWE owner Vince McMahon, pledged $18.5 million worth of pro-Trump advertising in the state. UFC President Dana White previously has pledged $1 million to the PAC.
In the face of criticism from the media and MMA observers, White has promised fighters competing at future events will be repeatedly tested, though he’s declined to elaborate on the measures that will be taken. The promotion this week outlined a new safety protocol for UFC 249 – now scheduled for May 9 – and two other events scheduled for May 13 and 16 in Jacksonville, Fla. The protocol requires “mandatory medical screening process and tests” and “additional medical screening” on a daily basis. The exact tests being given are unknown.
The Florida State Boxing Commission, which regulates the May UFC events, told MMA Fighting the commission “will employ social distancing wherever possible as recommended by the CDC, state and local officials in addition to existing health, safety and sanitation protocols” in response to an interview requesting information on safety procedures in place.
Other major MMA promotions await the go-ahead from state regulators. The ViacomCBS-owned Bellator hopes to promote closed-door events on a Hollywood soundstage this summer after the California State Athletic Commission implements new safety protocols.
Here is the ARP’s full statement:
The Association of Ringside Physicians recognizes that the circumstances regarding the COVID-19 pandemic are continually changing and evolving. As stay-at-home orders are relaxed, athletic commissions and combat sports governing bodies are looking to restart operations.
Although it is impossible to eliminate all risk associated with COVID-19, precautions can be made to reduce the risk of viral transmission. Many athletic commissions, organizations and promotors are developing new guidelines to limit exposure to all involved at events, including athletes, their teams, commission personnel and support staff.
Combat sports event procedures regarding COVID-19 precautions should be actively developed, regularly reviewed and modified based on the evolving knowledge and scientific evidence put forth by public health authorities. These guidelines should also involve local and regional public health officials as well as infectious disease experts and epidemiologists.
Our thoughts continue to be with those who have been and will be affected by this disease. We remain steadfast in our mission to serve, protect and educate all involved in combat sports. If any combat sports organization would like help in developing its guidelines, the Association of Ringside Physicians can provide assistance and guidance.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Everton's shirt sponsorship story following Swissx 'talks'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reports linking Everton to talks with Cannabidiol specialists Swissx have got Blues talking about just what kind of company’s logo they would like to see emblazoned on their shirts next season.
Like half of the Premier League, Everton are currently sponsored by a betting firm, in their case SportPesa.
Although none of the big six have such shirt deals, a report in the Daily Mail earlier this year suggested that brands linked to gambling are paying double the price so-called “ethical” companies are offering and the clubs can’t turn down the cash in order to compete.
However, after carrying the SportPesa logo on their shirts since 2017, Everton announced in February that they were ending their agreement two years early this summer, a month after chief executive Professor Denise Barrett-Baxendale had told those present at the club’s General Meeting that “in an ideal world” they would prefer a different type of sponsor.
Here’s a potted history of Everton’s shirt sponsors over the years.
The Blues went over a century without a sponsors logo on their shirt between 1878-1979 and for long periods they didn’t even have a club crest on their shirts but a hundred years after they first adopted the name Everton, after previously being St Domingo’s, they took the plunge into football’s new commercial world.
Danish meat manufacturers Hafnia had the honour of becoming Everton’s first sponsor and their logo was on their shirts for both the 1984 FA Cup final win – the club’s first trophy for 14 years – and during the 1984/85 League Championship season.
Curiously though, despite this association with one of Goodison’s golden ages, Hafnia’s products, including corned beef; pork roll; jellied veal and ox tongue were never even available for UK customers and dissolving soon after their deal with Everton ended, their name was passed on to Tyson Foods – but again no link to ‘Iron Mike.’
With Everton back in the spotlight in 1985 having secured the title and the Cup-Winners’ Cup – what would prove to be their only European trophy so far – they managed to land a major global brand in the shape of their decade-long association with NEC (Nippon Electric Company), headquartered in the Minato ward in the Japanese capital of Tokyo.
An IT and network solutions firm, they were the world’s largest semiconductor company at the time as well as being one of the biggest manufacturers of PCs.

Everton’s last League Championship was won on their watch and their final game as shirt sponsors was the 1-0 success over Manchester United in the 1995 FA Cup final – the Blues last major trophy to date.
In 1995 Everton struck a £4million deal with Danka, whose logo had already been seen by Merseyside sporting crowds earlier that year when it had been emblazoned on the silks of jockey Jason Titley as he rode 40/1 shot Royal Athlete to victory in the Grand National at Aintree.
A provider of office equipment such as photocopiers, printers and fax machines based out of St Petersburg, Florida, they cut their ties with the Blues two years later, switching to Formula One racing team Arrows, who had just moved to Oxfordshire and acquired reigning F1 champion driver Damon Hill.
Mobile phone operator One2One became Everton’s new sponsors in 1997 and launched their initial three-year deal with summer recruits Slaven Bilic and Gareth Farrelly showcasing their products on the Goodison turf.
Their first season with the Blues featured the embarrassment of an ‘upside down’ design on the players’ shirts after an eagle-eyed fan spotted that the design worn by the first team was different than the jerseys being sold to supporters.
Umbro who manufactured the kit were forced to act quickly and declared that it was the players’ kit that was wrong and the thousands of replica shirts that were right.
Everton only survived relegation on the final day of the 1997/98 season, with Kopites having previously mocked them with ‘Gone2one’ taunts (English football’s second tier was called Division One at this time) but the company stayed with the Blues for an additional two years until 2002 when they rebranded themselves as T-Mobile.
Everton’s £2.5million deal with Chinese electronics firm Kejian not only resulted in Mandarin writing on the Blues shirts but the acquisition of 2002 World Cup China international pair Li Weifeng and Li Tie for David Moyes’ squad.
The former, a centre-back, turned out just twice before returning home, but the latter proved to be a competent midfielder before a broken leg hampered his progress.
Everton stayed in the Far East for their next sponsors, Chang, Thailand’s largest beverage company whose main product is lager.
The 13-year-association would prove to be the longest shirt sponsorship in the club’s history with new deals struck in 2005, 2008, 2010 and 2014.
Everton and Chang also worked in close partnership to help victims of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami which affected Thailand and many parts of the Pacific region.
In 2017, SportsPesa, who billed themselves as “Africa’s leading Gaming Platform”, became Everton’s most-recent shirt sponsors.
Moving their European headquarters to the Royal Liver Building on the city’s waterfront which had recently been purchased by Everton’s majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri, their association also saw the Blues face East African club opposition three times for the SportPesa Trophy.
The first addition, featuring Prodigal Son Wayne Rooney’s return to his boyhood club after 13 years at Manchester United, saw Everton defeat Kenyan side Gor Mahia 2-1 in Tanzania’s National Stadium in Dar es Salaam.
The following season, Gor Mahia came to Goodison Park and were thrashed 4-0 by a Blues shadow squad in November but last summer Marco Silva’s side suffered the ignominy of a penalty shoot-out defeat to minnows Kariobangi Sharks after a 1-1 draw at the Moi International Sports Centre in Kasarani, Nairobi.
Last September, SportPesa, halted operations in Kenya after a rise in tax on betting stakes with Everton confirming their early parting of the ways on February 17, stating: “This has been a difficult decision but one that allows us to best deliver on our commercial plan and to grasp the new opportunities now open to us.”
Since September 2017, in line with a relaxing of Premier League regulations, Everton have also carried Angry Birds as a secondary shirt sponsor on the left sleeve of shirts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">EXCLUSIVE: A cannabis company is in talks to sponsor English Premier League side Everton FC, its CEO says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CORRECTION: This story previously said that Swissx is part-owned by Mike Tyson. A representative for Tyson denied the former boxer having any involvement in the company.
A cannabis company is in talks with English Premier League team Everton to sponsor its shirt, CEO Alki David told Insider this week.
Swissx, which was founded by and billionaire Alki David, is one of the world’s leading producers of cannabidiol (CBD) products.
Swissx had previously wanted to acquire the naming rights to FC Barcelona’s Camp Nou stadium, which are up for sale to raise money for coronavirus aide, however a deal was not reached.
Speaking with Insider, David, 51, said: “I’m not walking away from Barca, I’m keeping the door wide open. But we are now engaged with Everton to take over their shirt. The front of their shirt.
“They contacted me and have already offered designs with the whole Swissx logo in blue, which I’m not crazy about, but it will look nice.”
David added: “When I first came to England, everybody was supporting Man United and Liverpool, and everybody was red. Being contrary, I liked blue and I liked the logo so randomly I selected Everton to support. So it’s sort of a mystical come around.”
David has frequently discussed his links to former world heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson, and SwissX has been referred to frequently in the media, including by the BBC, as being “Tyson’s company.” A representative for Tyson denied to Insider that the boxer is in any way affialited with Swissx.
Everton is currently sponsored by Sportpesa, however will have a new sponsor next season after agreeing to cut short its contract with the betting firm in February, according to The Telegraph.
Should Everton partner with Swissx, it would be the first club in Premier League history to have a cannabis-based product as its shirt sponsor.
Everton did not reply to Insider’s request for comment on the possible deal.
Earlier in the week, David told BBC Sport he was looking at acquiring the naming rights to the Camp Nou, because it is a “great stadium” and “seemed like an amazing idea.”
Barcelona denied that there had been any contact between itself and Swissx, however David insists otherwise, and says the Spanish club are being publicly cautious because of the nature of the company.
“They are just being d—-,” he said. “My door is open.
“The bottom line is they are being really precious about this being a cannabis brand. But they’ve got to realise that UFC embraces cannabis, and other major sporting leagues accept cannabis.
“My brand is not a f—ing marijuana brand, its a wellness CBD brand based on health, not based on recreation.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘The front of their shirt’ – Everton approach Mike Tyson’s cannabis company for shirt sponsorship deal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In what would surely be one of the most controversial sponsorship deals to take place should it conclude successfully, Everton would appear to be ready to adorn their shirt with the logo of a cannabis company.
According to Insider, Swissx, which was founded by and billionaire Alki David and is one of the world’s leading producers of cannabidiol (CBD) products, are in talks with the Merseyside club regarding a partnership.
It was believed that the company, for whom boxing legend Mike Tyson is a partner, were also trying to get the naming rights for Barcelona’s iconic Camp Nou stadium, though that would appear to be off of the table for the present time at least.
“I’m not walking away from Barca, I’m keeping the door wide open,” David said. “But we are now engaged with Everton to take over their shirt. The front of their shirt.
“They contacted me and have already offered designs with the whole Swissx logo in blue, which I’m not crazy about, but it will look nice.”
Whether this will be seen to be regarded as a brave move from Everton, or an entirely stupid one, will surely only be known once the situation plays out to an eventual conclusion, one way or the other.
There may well be supporters who take the moral high ground on such organisations looking to do business with their club, but lest we forget the amount of clubs in England that are in bed with gambling companies too, and no one appears to have any problem with them.
The choice not to buy a shirt with such a sponsor would be open to anyone that disagreed with it, but it’s also true that the Toffees are certainly treading a very fine line at this juncture.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mike Tyson's cannabis company in talks to be sponsors for Premier League club</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mike Tyson’s business partner Alki David has claimed their cannabis company, Swissx, is in talks to sponsor Premier League team Everton.
Swissx CEO David and boxing legend Tyson have also been linked with buying the naming rights for Barcelona’s Camp Nou, but the producers of CBD products are also pushing to break into the Premier League market.
Everton are fielding offers for shirt sponsors and David revealed he received an approach from the Merseyside club.
‘I’m not walking away from Barca, I’m keeping the door wide open,’ David told Insider.
‘But we are now engaged with Everton to take over their shirt. The front of their shirt.
‘They contacted me and have already offered designs with the whole Swissx logo in blue, which I’m not crazy about, but it will look nice.’
‘When I first came to England, everybody was supporting Man United and Liverpool, and everybody was red,’ he continued.
‘Being contrary, I liked blue and I liked the logo so randomly I selected Everton to support. So it’s sort of a mystical come around.’
Barcelona recently denied they had received any offer from Swissx to acquire naming rights, while Everton is yet to respond to David’s comments.
Everton’s current sport sponsor are Kenyan bettingfirm SportPesa, but that partnership will end at the conclusion of this season.
With the coronavirus pandemic forcing football to go into shutdown, Everton will be grateful for the new sponsorship deal as clubs battle to deal with the financial effects of the lockdown.
Premier League chiefs are pushing ahead with plans to restart the 2019/20 season this summer and have selected eight ‘neutral’ venues where the remaining fixtures can be played.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Derby County manager Frank Lampard's verdict on football's return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Derby County manager Frank Lampard believes it "would not sit well" with him if Premier League players and staff receive coronavirus tests ahead of frontline health workers.
The Chelsea boss wants to see football return, but says safety must be the priority.
"The health and safety of players and staff is huge," Lampard told BT Sport.
"We play a contact sport we're all desperate to see – it’s a form of escapism, to watch football, play and train – but how are we not going to put the players at risk within that?
"The other issue is testing. We will probably have a minimum of 70 or 80 staff at Cobham [Chelsea’s training ground] if we’re going to restart training. It's right that we test regularly but when we're looking around the world, I think it's important for football to take its place.
"I don’t know the testing numbers for NHS and care workers, people who are doing these incredible jobs over the last two months. I don't think it would sit well, not just with me, but with anybody, if we didn’t make sure that people who are in that frontline are getting tested."
Lampard said players and managers are yet to discuss safety guidelines with league officials. The Premier League issued a statement after the latest round of talks on Friday.
"I’m in contact with [Chelsea chairman] Bruce Buck, who goes to the meetings and we speak regularly," Lampard said.
"The things I welcomed [from Friday’s meeting] were that player and staff health and safety will come first, and the fact they're going to have conversations with players and managers, because that hasn’t really happened yet."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chelsea boss Lampard: Test frontline staff before footballers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chelsea manager Frank Lampard has said he opposes the idea to test footballers for coronavirus before frontline health workers in an attempt to restart the season.
Following a video conference involving all 20 Premier League clubs on Friday, the determination to complete the season, which has been suspended since March 13, was re-stated by the league.

Sources have told ESPN that the campaign will be concluded behind closed doors at neutral venues if football can return safely but Lampard said players should not be tested before frontline workers.
"The health and safety of players and staff is huge," he told BT Sport."We play a contact sport we're all desperate to see -- it's a form of escapism, to watch football, play and train -- but how are we not going to put the players at risk within that?
"The other issue is testing. We will probably have a minimum of 70 or 80 staff at Cobham [training ground] if we're going to restart training. It's right that we test regularly, but when we're looking around the world... I think it's important for football to take its place.
"I don't know the testing numbers for National Health Service [NHS] and care workers, people who are doing these incredible jobs over the last two months. I don't think it would sit well, not just with me, but with anybody, if we didn't make sure that people who are in that frontline are getting tested."
In March, Chelsea made the Millennium Hotel at their Stamford Bridge stadium in London available to the NHS to provide accommodation to staff as they fight the pandemic.
Sources have told ESPN that the club has asked first-team players who are overseas to return to England and be on standby should the Premier League step up plans to return.
London clubs Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United have reopened their training grounds to allow players to continue that work while observing strict social distancing measures but Chelsea are yet to utilise their Cobham base in the same way.
As with all Premier League sides, the Chelsea squad have been following individual programmes since action was put on hold.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lampard says idea of footballers getting tested before NHS staff 'doesn't sit well'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Chelsea manager, Frank Lampard, has said it “would not sit well” with him if Premier League players and staff receive Covid-19 tests while frontline health workers cannot access them.
Speaking on BT Sport, Lampard added that he wants professional football to return, but that player and staff safety must be the priority. The 41-year-old added that “there are many conversations” to be had, including around player contracts, before the season can resume.
“The health and safety of players and staff is huge,” Lampard said. “We play a contact sport we’re all desperate to see – it’s a form of escapism, to watch football, play and train – but how are we not going to put the players at risk within that?”
“The other issue is testing,” Lampard told presenter Jake Humphrey. “We will probably have a minimum of 70 or 80 staff at Cobham [Chelsea’s training ground] if we’re going to restart training. It’s right that we test regularly, but when we’re looking around the world … I think it’s important for football to take its place.
“I don’t know the testing numbers for NHS and care workers, people who are doing these incredible jobs over the last two months,” Lampard said. “I don’t think it would sit well, not just with me, but with anybody, if we didn’t make sure that people who are in that frontline are getting tested.”
On Thursday, the Guardian reported that the Premier League is set to invest in Covid-19 testing machines that cost £36,000 each and can test seven employees per day. There is little demand for these particular machines from the NHS due to costs involved.
Lampard, whose Chelsea side sit fourth in the suspended Premier League table, also said players and managers are yet to discuss safety guidelines with league officials. The Premier League issued a statement after the latest round of talks on Friday, but Lampard said it “didn’t say that much practically. There are a lot of unknowns at the moment.”
“I’m in contact with [Chelsea chairman] Bruce Buck, who goes to the meetings and we speak regularly,” Lampard said. “The things I welcomed [from Friday’s meeting] were that player and staff health and safety will come first, and the fact they’re going to have conversations with players and managers, because that hasn’t really happened yet.”
Lampard also raised concerns about “football integrity issues”, including playing games at neutral venues and resolving the issue of out-of-contract players. “We have a couple of major players [out of contract in June],” Lampard said, referring to Willian and Olivier Giroud. “There are many conversations [to be had], and I think that’s very clear at the minute.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Breathing football' - why this season has been about much, much more than wins for Derby County's Academy</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There will be understandable disappointment that Derby County's under-23s cannot complete their season due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The Premier League announced on Friday that all youth football covering under-9 to under-16 games as well as the under-18 and under-23 competitions has been cancelled.
Football is facing some big decisions, and this decision is one that comes as no surprise but the many plus points from Derby's under-23 and under-19/18 seasons deserve mention.
Derby's under-18s topped Premier League North last season and went on to beat Arsenal 5-2 in the National Final.
The success booked a place in UEFA Youth Under-19 League this season and the Rams reached the last 16 in what was their first venture in the competition. Justin Walker's side beat FC Minsk comfortably and Icelandic IA Akranes before recording an excellent 3-1 home victory over Borussia Dortmund. The European adventure ended in Austria in March when RB Salzburg provded too strong on the day and came out 4-1 winners.
"Overall, we’ve surprised ourselves at times, there is a really good culture at the club, and we have enjoyed the run. we have good players. There is a lot to take away from this experience," said Walker.
Derby were missing midfielder Louie Sibley, who was suspended, and forward Morgan Whittaker, who stayed behind with the first-team squad preparing for an FA Cup tie against Manchester United.
Sibley and Whittaker, and young midfielders Max Bird and Jason Knight, are examples of what youth football is really all about and the mission of an academy which is to develop players for the first team. All four are currently in and around the senior side.
Winning matches is very nice, and winning breeds confidence which in turn can accelerate the development and progress of young players. The under-23s enjoyed many impressive performances and victories this season in a variety of competitions.
They faced a challenging start to the Premier League 2 Division One campaign with fixtures against Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur, Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City. They beat Tottenham and Manchester City, and drew with Arsenal and Liverpool.
Sibley had made his first-team debut the previous month before his performance in the under-23s 3-3 draw at Liverpool in September was described as "outstanding" by senior professional development phase coach Pat Lyons.
"It was the way he made things happen, drove with the ball, went past players with ease and with high quality," said Lyons. "The only thing missing from his game was a goal but if he keeps doing what he’s doing then the goals will come. I’m sure he will continue to do well and be part of the first team."
Lyons has been proved right. Sibley, still 18, has made eight appearances for the first team this season. He has started the last two games and scored a spectacular goal in the 3-0 victory over Blackburn Rovers before the COVID-19 outbreak halted football.
Knight hit both goals to beat Brighton 2-1 at the end of October as the under-23s stretched their unbeaten league run to eight matches and topped the table.
The 19-year-old Knight had already played nine times in the first team and he has made a further 17 appearances since, 15 of them starts. He has started four of the last five matches.
Phillip Cocu has been impressed by Knight. "What is there not to like about Jason?. He is breathing football," said Cocu.
After watching Knight score both goals in the home win against Charlton Athletic at the end of December, Cocu said: "A player from our own academy getting man-of-the-match and two goals is a great feeling. Sometimes he (Knight) has to play on the right, sometimes in the midfield and sometimes on the left. Tactically he does things right for the team and he is a real team player. I just enjoy watching him work and play football. It doesn’t matter if it is training, afternoon sessions or a game; it is always 100% effort."
Bird has progressed from being captain of the under-23 side in the first half of the season to a regular starter in Cocu's first team since the turn of the year.
The 19-year-old has lined up in 12 of the last 13 Championship matches, mostly alongside skipper Wayne Rooney in central midfield. Rooney has been glowing in his praise.
"As a young player, it is not easy to do the simple things, and that's what he (Max) does. He gets the ball and moves it on. He keeps it simple and defends well," said Rooney "He has been great, to play alongside him has made my job easier. He is getting better every week and he is a joy to play with."
Cocu certainly likes what he sees. "Max came into the side and seized the opportunity. When you look at his age, it is just great to see him playing this way for the club," said Cocu.
Wins against Monaco, Feyenoord and Southampton saw the under-23s progress in the Premier League International Cup before their bid to reach the semi-finals ended in dramatic fashion. Up against a West Ham United side that featured Andriy Yarmolenko and Carlos Sanchez, the Rams lost 6-5 on penalties following a 3-3 draw after extra time.
Striker Jahmal Hector-Ingram scored in each round including two against West Ham, where he spent 14 years from a young age before leaving last summer and joining Derby.
The 21-year-old has scored 22 goals this season. Goalscorers naturally catch the eye, and Hector-Ingram has shown he can finish but there are other areas of his game he needs to improve if he is to make the next step.
One of his many goals came in the 6-0 victory over Middlesbrough in March that saw the under-23s reach the last eight of the Premier League Cup and the season being cancelled curtailed hopes of possible silverware.
A winless run of five matches in the League saw Derby slip to fourth and 11 points behind leaders Chelsea although no decision has yet been made on how the final standings will be determined, and whether a title will be awarded and relegation enforced.
The under-18s also sit fourth in their division in which Manchester City are run-away leaders, 12 points ahead of second-placed Liverpool.
Bird, Knight, Sibley and Whittaker are currently flying the flag for the Academy although other names are emerging, one of them being 17-year-old Festy Ebosele a powerful and pacey right back or right-sided player who is a Republic of Ireland youth interantional.
The season may have ended prematurely for Derby's academy/youth sections but the real feather in the cap is the fact four graduates started in the last first-team game - Bird, Knight, Sibley and Jayden Bogle - and chairman Mel Morris has spoken of the club's vision of home-grown players forming 50% of the team from the start of next season.
Academy director Darren Wassall believes the current season has surpassed all others with the amount of involvement of players to have come through the youth system.
"No matter how well our Academy teams do, it is always about the individuals and getting them, if we can, into the first-team," Wassall told RamsTV in January.
"The main aim is always our first-team and if that isn’t possible, then hopefully somebody else’s.
"As an Academy, the trophies are our players that make it to the first-team after graduating. This year has surpassed all others really in terms of minutes that the Academy has contributed with the likes of Max Bird, Jason Knight, Louie Sibley, Morgan Whittaker and Lee Buchanan to name just five of them.
"It is really encouraging for everybody and it's a major achievement to see the players from the Academy making the first-team and holding their own. They haven’t just made their debuts and the odd appearance, they’ve held their own and are contributing to the team, and that’s fantastic for everybody."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marcus Rashford sends message to Man Utd youngsters as season is cancelled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford has told Manchester United's youngsters to keep their spirits up after the academy football season was cancelled.
The Premier League confirmed on Friday that all youth football seasons from under-23 level down to under-9 level had been curtailed, with United's under-23s sitting second in the second tier of Premier League 2.
"Premier League Shareholders today unanimously agreed to curtail the 2019/20 Academy Games Programme," said the league in a statement.
"This decision, which is independent of any discussions regarding the resumption of the 2019/20 campaign for first-team football, has been taken to give Academy staff and their players an element of clarity at this challenging time.
"The curtailment will include all Under-9 to Under-16 games as well as the Under-18 and Under-23 competitions.
Rashford responded to the news in a tweet on Saturday, when he urged the club's youngsters not to fall out of love with football.
"The news you got yesterday was probably not what you wanted to hear," he wrote.
"I know all you want to do is play because I'm the same but the decision has been made to protect everyone involved. This is bigger than football.
"You might be feeling a bit low but the best thing you can do is pick up your ball and get out in the garden.
"When I was in the academy I used to find a spot in the garden and aim for targets just so I could practice my accuracy, get creative!
"Now is not the time to fall out of love with the game, it's a time to remember why you fell in love with it in the first place. You've got this and we can't wait to see you all back next season."

    <h5 class="mb-1">United show renewed interest in Juve star Rabiot</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United have reportedly reignited their interest in Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot as they aim to replace Nemanja Matic.
At this stage it remains uncertain when that window will open, given that all major leagues currently remain suspended, but the majority of teams are continuing to identify their top targets.
And the latest reports suggest that the Red Devils are back in for a player who they have been chasing for more than two years, in Juve ace Rabiot.
According to Tuttomercatoweb, United scouted Rabiot earlier this season, and have made plans to swoop for him when the football world gets back to normality.
The 25-year-old could have moved to Old Trafford on a free transfer last summer but opted to head to reigning Serie A champions Juve instead.
The France international has gone on to establish himself in Maurizio Sarri's first XI but despite that, the Turin outfit are still said to be ready to listen to offers for Rabiot.
Juve are conscious of the fact that they could make a small fortune by selling a player that cost them nothing, and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is still said to be looking for an upgrade on Matic - despite the club picking up the one-year option to extend the Serbian's contract.
Before joining Juventus, Rabiot spent his entire career with PSG after progressing through their academy, making 227 appearances for the French giants and winning a whopping 18 trophies.
His potential arrival in Manchester could lead to shake-up in United's midfield, with Paul Pogba and Jesse Lingard continuing to be linked with moves away from the club and Solskjaer also said to be in the market for the likes of Jack Grealish, James Maddison and Donny Van de Beek.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Liverpool 'leading Manchester United, Real Madrid in Kalidou Koulibaly race'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Serie A outfit are said to be willing to listen to offers for the 28-year-old ahead of the 2020-21 campaign.
Both United and Madrid have been strongly linked with a move for the Senegal international, who has been restricted to just 15 Serie A appearances this season due to injury.
Liverpool have also recently been credited with an interest, though, and according to Gazzetta dello Sport, the European champions are the favourites to complete a deal.
The report claims that the Merseyside club's willingness to include experienced Croatian Dejan Lovren as part of a bid means that they are ahead of both United and Madrid in the race for the centre-back.
Koulibaly - thought to be valued by his Italian club in the region of £89m - has a contract with Gennaro Gattuso's side until the end of the 2022-23 campaign.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man United have scouted Serie A midfield target several times this season</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United have been scouting Juventus midfielder Adrien Rabiot all season, according to the Sun via Tutto Mercato.
The report states that United scouts have watched Rabiot ‘several times’ this season and are looking to sign the midfielder from the Serie A outfit.
News of the Red Devils scouting Rabiot is sure to intensify transfer speculation about a move for the Frenchman from Turin to Old Trafford, as per the latest developments.
Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is keen to bolster his midfield following the arrival of Bruno Fernandes from Sporting Lisbon with United star midfielder Paul Pogba’s future also up in the air at the moment.
Juventus are keen on signing Pogba according to widespread transfer speculation and a swap deal involving Rabiot for Pogba could be on the cards.
The French midfielder Rabiot hasn’t pinned down a starting spot at Juventus since his move from Paris Saint-Germain and could be on the move should his current club sign another midfielder.
At the moment, however, there is no news of a bid for Rabiot but United are firmly interested in securing his signature.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United identify ideal Paul Pogba replacement and more transfer rumours</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United have identified Donny Van de Beek as the ideal signing to replace Paul Pogba if the Frenchman leaves Old Trafford, reports say.
Pogba is once again subject to speculation linking him with a move away from United this summer. He has spent most of the current campaign on the sidelines with injury.
Now, Spanish newspaper Sport suggest United are open to letting Pogba leave at the end of the season and have already identified Ajax midfielder Van de Beek as the ideal man to replace him.
Van de Beek impressed in Ajax's run to the 2018/19 Champions League semi-finals, before helping the Netherlands to the inaugural Nations League final last summer. With the Dutch season now cancelled and no title awarded, Van de Beek may be available with no more fixtures to play until next season. MEN Sport understands United like the player.
Meanwhile, Inter Milan forward Lautaro Martinez has decided he wants to move to Barcelona this summer, according to reports.
Mundo Deportivo suggest the Argentine has chosen to join Barcelona despite interest from United, City and Chelsea.
Finally, United will not force Jesse Lingard out of the club this year and could even trigger a one-year extension in his current deal, according to 90 min.
Lingard has had a frustrating time over the last 12 months, and has found himself on the fringes of the starting XI while other players have strengthened their places in Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's thoughts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lille receive offer for Liverpool and Manchester United target Osimhen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An unnamed club have reportedly tabled a bid to sign Lille striker Victor Osimhen, who has been linked with Liverpool and Manchester United.
Osimhen has attracted interest throughout Europe after scoring 18 goals in 38 appearances during his breakthrough season in France.
The 21-year-old sat joint-fourth in the Ligue Un goalscoring charts, level with Neymar, before the season was curtailed due to the global pandemic.
Osimhen had impressed enough to be named as a 'priority' target for Man Utd this summer, while Inter Milan are among the continental clubs keeping a watchful eye on developments.
Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham have all also been linked but are unlikely to have been behind the reported £75m bid Lille have received for the Nigerian.
French outlet Telefoot suggest an unnamed side has completely ignored the fact that literally no-one has any money by bidding for Osimhen's services.
Liverpool are almost certain not to be the club in question after it emerged that they were planning for a second successive summer of no major signings due to the current financial situation.
The Reds had hoped to pursue Timo Werner and Houssem Aouar of Leipzig and Lyon respectively, but are now 'budgeting for the loss of income' and 'now look virtually certain' to spend nothing.
United can also perhaps be ruled out due to Ed Woodward's recent comments concerning the transfer window.
Odion Ighalo believes his compatriot is "the future of Nigerian football" who "has that lion's heart".
"I talk to Osimhen, he's a very nice boy, young, he's a good guy," Ighalo told Elegbete TV last month.
"We talk, not almost every day, but almost every time I advise him.
"He's the future, he's going to do so well in football. I always advise him to keep calm, keep working hard and the guy is going to be a celebrity, you know.
"I love him, I just want him to keep working hard the way he's doing, he's going to break so many records in Europe and Nigeria."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Transfer News: Unnamed club lodge €85 million bid for Victor Osimhen amid interest from Manchester United, Chelsea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to French outlet Telefoot, Lille have received a bid worth €85 million from an unnamed club for Victor Osimhen. The Nigerian striker is reportedly also being tailed by Manchester United and Chelsea over a move in the summer transfer window.
Osimhen joined Lille from RSC Charleroi last summer and made an instant impact at the Ligue 1 club. Now that the 2019-20 season has officially ended in France, and with Lille not in Europe, the 21-year-old’s final tally for the campaign reads a solid 18 goals and 6 assists in 38 appearances.
The player’s progress in his maiden season with Lille has not gone unnoticed. In fact, The Sun have reported that Manchester United and Chelsea are among the clubs that have been left impressed by Osimhen and have been plotting a summer move for him.
Manchester United have seen Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial take more responsibility this season and excelling in more influential roles. However, there is still a sense that Martial could do with some competition till Mason Greenwood is deemed ready to become a regular. If United don’t sign Odion Ighalo permanently, they will need to sign some other striker.
To that end, Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is one of a number of strikers linked with a switch to Old Trafford. Osimhen is the latest to be added to that shortlist and is a viable target for United with his pacy style of play and the ability to play across the frontline. As for Chelsea, the Blues appear to be in the same boat as Manchester United.
Tammy Abraham has enjoyed a stellar 2019-20 campaign, but Chelsea have struggled when he has been unavailable. Michy Batshuayi continues to be unimpressive, while Olivier Giroud could leave in search of regular game time. Like Manchester United, Chelsea are also said to be in pursuit of Aubameyang, with Dries Mertens another fowards linked lately.
Apart from Manchester United and Chelsea, the likes of Tottenham and Inter Milan also have Osimhen in their sights, while Liverpool have even contacted Lille over the possibility of signing the 21-year-old, as per The Sun. Now, though, an unnamed club has put an €85 million bid on the table for Les Dogues, according to Telefoot.
Bear in mind, this unnamed club could be Manchester United, Chelsea or any of the suitors named already. If not, though, both United and Chelsea ought to pull their socks up in order to prise Osimhen away from Lille.
Chelsea would be hoping to make good on their strong relations with Lille in order to land Osimhen having also attempted to sign Gabriel Magalhaes from the Ligue 1 outfit. As for Manchester United, it remains to be seen if they are willing to take the required steps to sign the Nigerian striker.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4"> ’Tosin Oluwalowo
Lille have received an €85m bid for Nigerian striker, Victor Osimhen, according to Telefoot.
According to the report, the unnamed club is interested in securing the services of Osimhen in the summer.
The Super Eagles forward has been the subject of interest of clubs, especially in the English Premier League.
The clubs include Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal.
Osimhen has been in great form since joining Lille from Belgian side Sporting Charleroi last summer and scored18 goals in 38 games.
Lille President,  Gerard Lopez, had earlier in the year spoken about how hard it might be for the club to keep the Nigeria international.
“Osimhen will be in Lille next season. Afterwards, there are factors I cannot control, such as the fact that a club comes and offers a salary that is six or eight times more than we can offer.
“But I think it is sometimes better not to take a high salary and wait for the next season,” Lopez told French media.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United rival Premier League clubs for transfer of Paul Pogba replacement</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United have reportedly targeted Ajax star Donny van de Beek as a potential replacement for Paul Pogba.
According to the print edition of Sport, as translated by Sport Witness, there is a large amount of interest in the Netherlands international, with Man Utd looking to strengthen in midfield.
Pogba has been heavily linked with a move to Real Madrid by the Sun, so a summer move for midfielder Van de Beek makes sense as an ideal substitute in that position.
The 23-year-old reached the Champions League semi-final last season with Ajax. The team’s performances provoked an extensive amount of transfer rumours linking players away. A few players left the Johan Cruyff Arena at the end of last season – Matthijs de Ligt and Frenkie De Jong among others – but Van de Beek stayed.
This season, van de Beek racked up 14 goal contributions in 23 Eredivisie appearances. However, the coronavirus pandemic has prompted the Dutch FA to cancel the season, ultimately eliminating his team’s chances of winning the league.
Many transfer rumours from the 2018/19 season have remained. According to Sport, as translated by Sport Witness, Newcastle and Everton have reportedly shown interest in signing Ajax’s ace. However, this report claims that the Red Devils are transfer ‘favourites’ for the Netherlands international.
If this deal goes ahead, it will upgrade United’s team and provide healthy competition for the likes of Fred and Scott McTominay, and it would surely also be a boost to land this top talent ahead of other Premier League clubs.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United are reportedly ready to replace club-record signing Paul Pogba at the end of the season with one of Europe's prominent midfield stars.
Read: Reports: Juve To Offer Five Names In Pogba Swap Deal
It is being reported that United are considering selling the 2018 World Cup winner, who has been linked with Juventus and Real Madrid over the past year.
Spanish publication AS has reported that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has become frustrated with Pogba's agent Mino Raiola and is ready to cut ties with the player.
The Red Devils have now turned their attention to Ajax Amsterdam star midfielder Donny van de Beek as their primary choice to replace Pogba next season, according to Sport.

It is believed that the Netherlands international would be available for a fee of around €60million and the United board have already discussed a possible deal.
Van de Beek was touted as a possible signing for Los Blancos in the January transfer window as an alternative to Pogba, as United were not keen to let the Frenchman leave this season.
Before the season was suspended, Van de Beek has registered 10 goals and 11 assists across all competitions for the Dutch giants.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ramsey and Douglas Costa could 'help' Pogba return to Juve</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Juventus are continuing to think of ways of persuading Manchester United to let Paul Pogba come back to Juventus. The Italian press says that two players could be offered to United in exchange for Pogba.
Everything seems to indicate that Paul Pogbawill use all his effort on trying to return to Juventus in the summer. The current Manchester United player could go back to Turin, but the 'Old Lady' must first persuade the Premier League club to sell him. Money alone may not be enough. 
A strange transfer window is coming up as there will be less signings and more swaps because of the coronavirus crisis.
Juventus would offer United not one, but two players in a bid to get Pogba. Journalist Nicolo Schira says the duo would be Aaron Ramsey and Douglas Costa.

The former arrived last summer for nothing from Arsenal, the club he has spent most of his career at. He has played 24 matches, exactly half of them as a starter, and has scored four goals.
The latter is in his third year as a Juventus player. He arrived in 2017 from Bayern Munich and this season, under Maurizio Sarri, he has played far less regularly compared to previous seasons. He has only made 18 appearances, eight of them as a starter. He has played for the club 90 times up to now.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 25-year-old ran down his contract at Paris Saint-Germain before joining Juve last summer, penning a four-year deal with the Italian champions.
Rabiot has made 24 appearances for Maurizio Sarri's side during the 2019-20 campaign but has only started 11 Serie A matches since arriving in Turin.
The Frenchman has been linked with a move away from the Italian champions ahead of this summer's transfer window, and according to Tuttomercatoweb, United are in the hunt for his signature.
The report claims that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side have watched the midfielder on several occasions this season as they explore the possibility of a summer deal.
Rabiot could be viewed as a potential replacement for Paul Pogba, who could allegedly be allowed to leave the 20-time English champions for £60m ahead of the 2020-21 campaign.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lille receive shock £75m bid for Liverpool, Man Utd target Osimhen</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
An unnamed club has lodged a £75m bid for Lille striker and Liverpool and Man Utd target Victor Osimhen, according to reports.
Osimhen has attracted interest throughout Europe after scoring 18 goals in 38 appearances during his breakthrough season in France.
The 21-year-old sat joint-fourth in the Ligue Un goalscoring charts, level with Neymar, before the season was curtailed due to the global pandemic.
Osimhen had impressed enough to be named as a ‘priority’ target for Man Utd this summer, while Inter Milan are among the continental clubs keeping a watchful eye on developments.
Liverpool, Chelsea and Tottenham have all also been linked but are unlikely to have been behind the reported £75m bid Lille have received for the Nigerian.
French outlet Telefoot suggest an unnamed side has completely ignored the fact that literally no-one has any money by bidding for Osimhen’s services.
Liverpool are almost certain not to be the club in question after it emerged that they were planning for a second successive summer of no major signings due to the current financial situation.
The Reds had hoped to pursue Timo Werner and Houssem Aouar of Leipzig and Lyon respectively, but are now ‘budgeting for the loss of income’ and ‘now look virtually certain’ to spend nothing.
United can also perhaps be ruled out due to Ed Woodward’s recent comments concerning the transfer window.
Odion Ighalo believes his compatriot is “the future of Nigerian football” who “has that lion’s heart”.
“I talk to Osimhen, he’s a very nice boy, young, he’s a good guy,” Ighalo told Elegbete TV last month.
“We talk, not almost every day, but almost every time I advise him.
“He’s the future, he’s going to do so well in football. I always advise him to keep calm, keep working hard and the guy is going to be a celebrity, you know.
“I love him, I just want him to keep working hard the way he’s doing, he’s going to break so many records in Europe and Nigeria.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Shock €85m transfer bid made for Man United and Chelsea target</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to the Sun via French outlet Telefoot, a shock bid worth a total of €85m (£75m) – including bonuses, has been made for Lille striker Victor Osimhen.
The Sun report that the 21-year-old is a target for Chelsea and Manchester United, as well as Liverpool, Spurs and Inter Milan.
The Sun claim that transfer expert Duncan Castles recently revealed on the Transfer Window Podcast that Liverpool were in ‘contact’ with Lille over the forward.
Castles added that Lille are ‘open’ to selling the Nigerian star this summer if they can receive the ‘right price’, a deal worth €85m certainly seems like a tempting offer for Osimhen’s services.
Osimhen has made waves with Lille since joining last summer, the star has bagged 18 goals and registered 6 assists in 38 appearances across all competitions this term.
The Sun add that Osimhen still has four years left on his contract with Lille, hinting that a massive bid will be needed to prise the talent away from the Ligue 1 outfit.
Whilst Castles’ recent update suggests that Liverpool were leading the race for the ace’s signature, United and Chelsea are perhaps more in need of signing a striker in the next transfer window.
Frank Lampard needs a star to compete – or even partner up with Tammy Abraham. Both Olivier Giroud and Michy Batshuayi have been ineffective this season, signalling that an addition is needed.
Man United on the other hand are said to be prioritising a move for a striker this summer by the Sun, as the Red Devils failed to replace either of Romelu Lukaku and Alexis Sanchez before the start of the season.
We wonder if this latest report regarding the bid for Osimhen is true, it’s hard to believe that an unnamed club have offered such a massive amount of money whilst the world is dealing with the Coronavirus pandemic.

Batra said the IOA had earlier requested the government in this regard but was not successful in eliciting a positive response. Some athletes at the NIS-Patiala had also written to the Sports Ministry to allow outdoor training by observing government’s social distancing guidelines.
“We have made some efforts trying to convince the Ministry of Home Affairs to allow athletes to train outdoors with all social distancing guidelines,” said Batra. The campers at the NIS, at Bengaluru SAI Centre and SAI Kolkata have not been able to have outdoor training,” Batra said.
“I don’t know whether they will be allowed in the next two weeks of lockdown. But I am once again trying on Sunday with the government,” he said while addressing online the Special General Body Meeting of the Athletics Federation of India.
He also offered his good offices to intervene on any issue relating to the extension of tenure of the coaches and High Performance Directors of various National Sports Federations.
Batra suggested the AFI consider extending the contracts of the coaches till the 2022 Asian Games and Commonwealth Games.
“Please take a decision on the extension of contracts of High Performance Directors or coaches. Let me know if I can be of any help. I will intervene whenever required and try to sort out the issue (with sports ministry).
“I think in some sports, the Asiad or Commonwealth Games are 2024 Olympics qualification events or will offer ranking points for qualification. So, federations can even think of that on the extension of contract of coaches.”
Batra lauded the AFI’s efforts to raise the profile of the country’s athletics.
“Athletics always lead in India’s impressive performances in the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games.”

"I don't know whether they will be allowed in the next two weeks of lockdown. But I am once again trying on Sunday with the government," he said while addressing online the Special General Body Meeting of the Athletics Federation of India.

He also offered his good offices to intervene on any issue relating to the extension of tenure of the coaches and High Performance Directors of various National Sports Federations.
Batra even suggested the AFI to consider extending the contracts of the coaches till the 2022 Asian Games and Commonwealth Games.
"Please take a decision on the extension of contracts of High Performance Directors or coaches. Let me know if I can be of any help. I will intervene whenever required and try to sort out the issue (with sports ministry).
"I think in some sports the Asian Games or the Commonwealth Games are 2024 Olympics qualification events or will offer ranking points for qualification. So, federations can even think of that on the extension of the contract of coaches," he added.
Batra lauded the AFI's efforts to raise the profile of the country's athletics.
"Athletics always lead in India's impressive performances in the Asian Games and Commonwealth Games."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dana White Reveals He Has 'Something Interesting' Lined-Up For Jorge Masvidal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Jorge Masvidal’s title shot against current welterweight champion Kamaru Usman looks like it may still be a while away yet, according to UFC President Dana White.
It had looked as though Masvidal vs Usman would be set for July’s International Fight Week. However, with the coronavirus outbreak causing disruption to the UFC’s calendar, the fight was never made official.
It was expected to still occur sometime this year. But White threw a spanner in the works by outlining that he has “something else interesting” lined up for the BMF champion.
“We’re talking about a few different things,” White told ESPN., in quotes reported by MMAFighting.com.
“We have something else interesting for Masvidal that we were just talking about yesterday. We’ll see. We’ll see how this whole thing plays out.
“To start speculating down the road now is too soon. Let’s get by these three fights in Florida and then we’ll figure out what’s next. We’re talking about different possibilities with those guys.”
Masvidal has been linked with a number of different opponents, including Conor McGregor, since he impressively defeated Nate Diaz for the BMF title at Madison Square Garden in November.
Speaking last month, Usman was adamant that the pair will be squaring off in the octagon at some stage.
“We are at 100 percent,” he told ESPN. “This is the guy. I’ve said it over and over again: Anything you say about me, to me, can and will be used against you, and he has just stepped over that line to where it’s 100 percent.
“That’s the fight that I want. That’s the fight that makes sense. That is the next victim, and look at what they just pulled. I mean, look at the situation they just pulled. You ran your mouth. You said you wanted to fight. All right. Let’s do it.
“Then all of a sudden, oh, it wasn’t working out for you. It wasn’t working out for you, so you pulled out of the fight. So it sucks, but it is what it is. He for sure has won a date with me. He’s got a golden ticket with his name on it. He’s won a date. That’s the next guy that I’m going to step inside that octagon and put my hands on.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dana White has an opponent in mind for Jorge Masvidal</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A title fight between the 'BMF' title holder Jorge Masvidal and reigning UFC welterweight champion Kamaru Usman seemed almost inevitable given the pair's recent exchanges on social media as well as their infamous altercation at the Super Bowl media day; but just when you think you have it all figured when it comes to UFC's matchmaking, the organization's president Dana White springs up with a surprise.
However, White revealed he has other ideas. Although Usman and Masvidal looked set to lock horns inside the Octagon later this year (possibly during the International Fight Week in July), White has a different plan in his mind for the "Baddest Motherf****r" in the fight game.
Speaking to ESPN, White said that he has "something interesting for Masvidal" but it's not the fight against Usman. White said that it is too early to divulge into details right now, but after the UFC's upcoming events in Florida are done with, there will be clarity on the situation.
According to MMA Fighting, Masvidal hasn't had any discussions with the promotion regarding his next opponent but might be because of the fact that White only recently came up with the idea of another opponent for the fighter.
Post his emphatic victory against Nate Diaz at UFC 244, where Masvidal became the 'BMF' champion 'Gamebred' wanted to throw it down against one of the most successful fighters in the promotion, Conor McGregor. For the longest time, Masvidal tried to evoke a reaction out of the Irishman but unfortunately, it never came through the way Gamebred wanted it to.
McGregor returned to action against Donald Cerrone in the headliner of UFC 246 and smoked the latter within 40 seconds of the first round. Masvidal was present at Octagon side and it was speculated that McGregor would call out Masvidal in the post fight interview but nothing of that sort happened and both men moved on since then.
With White now revealing that he has a fresh opponent in mind for Masvidal, could we see the bout finally come to fruition? Only time will tell.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dana White: Something ‘interesting’ in the works for Jorge Masvidal other than Usman title fight</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Surging UFC superstar Jorge Masvidal may not end up getting the welterweight title shot he was expecting, but that doesn’t mean “Gamebred” won’t land something even better.
Masvidal, who is riding a three-fight win streak after one of the best 2019 campaigns you will ever see, was believed to be the front runner to land the next title shot against current UFC welterweight champion Kamaru Usman. The two were even rumored to clash at UFC 249 last month, but Masvidal’s financial demands simply weren’t met.
While the proposed title fight could still happen at some point this year, it now seems as if the promotion is discussing another opportunity for Masvidal. On Friday, UFC president Dana White revealed that he is working on something “interesting” for the welterweight veteran, but that it wasn’t a clash with Usman.
“We’re talking about a few different things,” White told ESPN. “We have something else interesting for Masvidal, too, that we were just talking about (Thursday). We’ll see.”
Of course, the first “interesting” thing that comes to mind would be a clash with UFC superstar Conor McGregor. It remains the biggest matchup for Masvidal since he defeated Nate Diaz to claim the “BMF” title back at UFC 244. And after McGregor made a triumphant return to the Octagon at UFC 246 in a welterweight clash with Donald Cerrone the promotion can’t possibly still believe that Masvidal is too big for “Notorious.”
You also have to consider that McGregor may no longer have the opportunity to fight lightweight contender Justin Gaethje this summer as previously speculated. That’s because Gaethje will fight Tony Ferguson at UFC 249 next weekend for the interim lightweight title as current champion Khabib Nurmagomedov plots his return this fall.
That said, UFC could also be looking to finally book a grudge match between Masvidal and streaking welterweight contender Leon Edwards. The two fighters first clashed over one year ago when Masvidal pieced up Edwards backstage at UFC London (see it HERE), which is where “Gamebred” finished Darren Till with one punch. Seeing as Edwards has now won his last eight Octagon appearances the 170-pound matchup makes a whole lot of sense.
“We’ll see how this whole thing plays out – locations and how fast,” White said. “To start speculating down the road right now is too soon. Let’s get by these three fights in Florida and we’ll figure out what’s next. We’re talking about different possibilities with those guys.”
What say you, Maniacs? If not Usman, who should Masvidal fight next?
Let’s hear it!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ultra-triathlete puts the pedal to the metal for good cause</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Confined to his tiny living room, ultra-triathlete Pascal Pich is still going a long way for a good cause.
The 56-year-old Frenchman is a five-time world champion of ultra-triathlon in which athletes may swim 3.8km, cycle 180km and finish by running a marathon.
While in confinement because of the coronavirus pandemic, he has covered 8,000km on a stationary bike on rollers.
His aim, as he pedals like a madman, is to raise money to make the lives of health workers easier.
His programme has included a return to an old favourite, the Tour de France. He once rode the Tour route in eight days and eight nights.
This time he started out by covering the equivalent of the 21 stages in 14 days without moving from his home in Savignargues, 30km from Nimes, in the south of France.
“The mileage is quite monstrous, but it’s nothing exceptional. What’s exceptional is doing it all alone and locked up,” Pich said.
“The idea is just to pedal.”
He goes “live” on social media every day and one of his sponsors has agreed to contribute money in return for “likes”.
They are using the funds to buy equipment, such as coffee machines, microwaves and table-tennis tables for health-care workers.
“One hundred machines have been delivered to the medical staff in 28 different hospitals,” said Pich.
At the start of the official lockdown in France, Pich looked for ways to help those on the front line in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.
“Everyone does what they want to do and I want to pedal, so I pedal,” he said.
“I don’t care what other people think! It’s just as stupid to be sitting in your living room in front of the TV knocking back beers.”
After riding the 3,471km of the 21-stage Tour without leaving home, he allowed himself a short week of recovery. Then he climbed back on his stationary bike for 54 hours of racing over six days, the equivalent of a week’s work for the doctors.
Most recently, starting on April 24, he began working what he called 3x8 shifts to mirror the medical teams.
“That means eight hours of pedalling, eight hours of recovery,” Pich added.
He was aiming for 88 hours of cycling in seven days, covering between 250km and 320km in each eight-hour session.
In total, he will have travelled 8,000 km, alone in his small living room with his only view of the outside world the balcony where he hangs his sports clothes to dry.
“I’m all alone in the apartment. It’s really hard to deal with because I’m locked in a room that’s about 14 square metres. There is very little air,” said Pich, whose world records include distance covered in six days on a stationary bike (3,165 km), which he set in May 2018.
He is surrounded by electronic displays: a huge timer, like those used at major athletics events, a laptop and a TV screen on which he can watch movies.
“I hope for everyone that this will be the last challenge,” he said.
“Because I’m starting to get a bit burnt out, because it will mean we’ve made some progress with this virus. And that the medical staff are a little more relaxed.” – AFP

    <h5 class="mb-1">Triathlete racks up miles for good cause while going nowhere fast</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Savignargues, France: Confined to his tiny living room ultra-triathlete Pascal Pich is still going a long way in a good cause.
The 56-year-old Frenchman is a five-time world champion of ultra-triathlon in which athletes may swim 3.8 kilometres, cycle 180 kilometres and finish by running a marathon.
While in confinement because of the coronavirus pandemic he has covered 8,000 kilometres (4,970 miles) on a stationary bike on rollers.
His aim, as he pedals like a madman, is to raise money to make the lives of health workers easier.
His programme has included a return to an old favourite, the Tour de France. He once rode the Tour route in eight days and eight nights. This time he started out by covering the equivalent of the 21 stages in 14 days without moving from his home in Savignargues, 30 kilometres from Nimes, in the south of France.
"The mileage is quite monstrous but it's nothing exceptional. What's exceptional is doing it all alone and locked up," Pich told AFP. "The idea is just to pedal."
He goes live on social media every day and one of his sponsors has agreed to contribute money in return for "likes". They are using the funds to buy equipment, such as coffee machines, microwaves and table-tennis tables for health-care workers.
"One hundred machines have been delivered to the medical staff in 28 different hospitals," says Pich.
'I want to pedal'
At the start of the official lockdown in France, Pich looked for ways to help those on the front line in the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.
"Everyone does what they want to do, and I want to pedal, so I pedal," he said. "I don't care what other people think! It's just as stupid to be sitting in your living room in front of the TV knocking back beers."
After riding the 3,471km of the 21-stage Tour without leaving home, he allowed himself a short week of recovery. Then he climbed back on his stationary bike for 54 hours of racing over six days, the equivalent of a week's work for the doctors.
Most recently, starting on April 24, he began working what he called 3x8 shifts to mirror the medical teams. "That means eight hours of pedalling, eight hours of recovery".
He was aiming for 88 hours of cycling in seven days, covering between 250km and 320km in each eight-hour session.
In total, he will have travelled 8,000 km, alone in his small living room with his only view of the outside world the balcony where he hangs his sports clothes to dry.
"I'm all alone in the apartment. It's really hard to deal with because I'm locked in a room that's about 14 square metres. There is very little air," says Pich, whose world records include distance covered in six days on a stationary bike (3,165 km), which he set in May 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Back garden athletics: top vaulters set for 'ultimate clash'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Paris: Three of the world's top male pole vaulters will meet in competition on Sunday in what has been dubbed the "Ultimate Garden Clash", with world sports decimated by the coronavirus pandemic.
World record-holder Mondo Duplantis of Sweden, two-time world champion Sam Kendricks of the United States and 2012 Olympic champion Renaud Lavillenie of France will be connected via a live video link as they compete from their own back gardens.
The event, which will be streamed by World Athletics, is scheduled to start at 1500 GMT and will span three locations: Lavillenie will vault from his home in Clermont-Ferrand, Kendricks will compete from his back garden in Oxford, Mississippi, and Duplantis will take part from his base in Lafayette, Louisiana.
The three vaulters will attempt to vault 5.00m as many times as possible in 30 minutes, a format the trio drew up in the face of a lack of officials.
"I'm ecstatic to be able to compete again, especially against Sam and Renaud," said Duplantis.
"Since it's unknown what other competitions we will all have together, we definitely are going to enjoy this and have a good time with it. Also, winning this is crucial because I don't like losing to them very much."
Lavillenie added: "This is a superb opportunity to see the best jumpers in a new competition format showing their love for their sport with a competition when most other sports are off."
Kendricks said it would be a question of "learning as we go".
"No matter how precise and accurate we are, I think the challenge is we don't know what it will take to win, so it will be hard to gauge our effort."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Athletics resumes with one-off international pole vault clash in stars' gardens</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Athletics will get around lockdown restrictions tomorrow by staging an international competition - in back gardens almost 5,000 miles apart.
Dubbed the Ultimate Garden Challenge, pole vault world record holder Mondo Duplantis will take on two-time world champion Sam Kendricks and 2012 Olympic champion Renaud Lavillenie live across social media.
Each has facilities at home, with Sweden's Duplantis and American Kendricks based 250 miles apart in the USA and Frenchman Lavillenie in Clermont-Ferrand.
The event will see each man attempt to clear five metres as many times as possible in 30 minutes - as it is not possible to have officials on hand to regulate a standard competition.
"We definitely are going to enjoy this," said Duplantis, who cleared a world record 6.18m in Glasgow in February. "Also, winning is crucial because I don't like losing to them very much.”
Athletics has lost its summer to the pandemic with at least the first half of the Diamond League season postponed along with all championships.
British pole vault queen Holly Bradshaw expressed delight that her discipline had come up with an innovative solution.
“It’s a really cool idea,” she said. “I only wish I could fit a pole vault pit in my 4m v 5m back garden!
“I’ll definitely be watching and I’ll be interested to see if it works and gets a good reception as something new and exciting could really put the spotlight on athletics.”
Meanwhile Katarina Johnson-Thompson has indicated she will not defend her world indoor pentathlon title in China next March as the rescheduled event clashes with the Europeans in Poland.
“When all of this got announced, the hope was the Olympics would be switched to the spring,” she said. “Then you could do the world indoors and just stay out there.
“Then they moved it to exactly a year after. With the Europeans now two weeks before the world indoors, I’m not sure it would make sense for me to do that as I cannot do the pentathlon in both.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United striker Marcus Rashford has urged the club’s academy players to keep working through the shutdown after the Premier League ended the youth league season on Friday.
All games for the under-23 competitions and below have been terminated for the rest of the season, with a means of determining final standings still to be announced.
But the 22-year-old Rashford, who has come through the ranks at United, sent a message to academy players telling them to be “creative” as they try to keep improving despite the shutdown.
“The news you got yesterday was probably not what you wanted to hear,” Rashford wrote on Twitter. “I know all you want to do is play because I’m the same but the decision has been made to protect everyone involved. This is bigger than football.
“You might be feeling a bit low but the best thing you can do is pick up your ball and get out in the garden.
“When I was in the academy I used to find a spot in the garden and aim for targets just so I could practice my accuracy, get creative!
“Now is not the time to fall out of love with the game, it’s a time to remember why you fell in love with it in the first place. You’ve got this and we can’t wait to see you all back next season.”

But the 22-year-old Rashford, who has come through the ranks at United, sent a message to academy players telling them to be "creative" as they try to keep improving despite the shutdown.
"The news you got yesterday was probably not what you wanted to hear," Rashford wrote on Twitter. "I know all you want to do is play because I'm the same but the decision has been made to protect everyone involved. This is bigger than football.
"You might be feeling a bit low but the best thing you can do is pick up your ball and get out in the garden.
"When I was in the academy I used to find a spot in the garden and aim for targets just so I could practice my accuracy, get creative!
"Now is not the time to fall out of love with the game, it's a time to remember why you fell in love with it in the first place. You've got this and we can't wait to see you all back next season."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marcus Rashford sends classy message to Manchester United youngsters after academy season cancelled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Marcus Rashford has sent a message to Manchester United youngsters after the news that the academy season has been cancelled, urging them to remember why they fell in love with football.
The Premier League confirmed that all academy football up to under-23 level has been curtailed due to the coronavirus crisis to give clubs and players clarity at this uncertain time. United's under-23's were second in the Premier League 2 Division 2 before the season was cancelled, three points behind leaders West Ham with a game in hand.
The league will now decide how the final standings of the league will be decided, leaving United waiting to discover if they will be promoted to the top flight of youth football. The decision does not apply to the FA Youth Cup.
In response to the news, Rashford took to Twitter to share a message to young players at United affected by the news, saying the decision was made to protect them and offering advice on how to keep their spirits up.
He wrote: "The news you got yesterday was probably not what you wanted to hear. I know all you want to do is play because I'm the same, but the decision has been made to protect everyone involved. This is bigger than football.
"You might be feeling a bit low but the best thing you can do is pick up your ball and get out in the garden. When I was in the academy I used to find spot in the garden and aim for targets just so I could practice my accuracy, get creative!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19 exit plan: Golf clubs will only be open to members who live within 5km</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Golf clubs across Ireland are set to reopen on May 18th as part of the first phase of the Government’s coronavirus exit plan but only people who are members of a club within 5km of their homes will be allowed to play, according to the Department of Health.
Taoiseach Leo Varadkar announced the five stage plan to reopen Ireland on Friday with golf courses and tennis courts included in phase one which begins in a little over two weeks.
From this Tuesday, May 5th the travel restriction limit - which is currently set at 2km - will extend to 5km and will remain in place until it is extended to 20km on June 8th.
After some initial confusion, a spokesperson for the Department of Health confirmed to The Irish Times on Saturday that only essential journeys can exceed the travel limits and that going to play golf does not come under that remit.
The Golfing Union of Ireland (GUI) said on Friday that they would be publishing a document next week advising golf clubs on how they can implement safe golf with social distancing in place while they also clarified that, initially, play will be for members only and no competitions will take place.
The GUI have not said when play will be possible for non-members or when competitions can begin and some of the finer details are expected to be cleared up when the document is published. However, going by the Government’s exit plan, golf club members who live further than 5km from their home course will not be able to play there until June 8th and those who live further than 20km won’t be able to play until July 20th.
That’s the date when stage four of the plan kicks in which allows people to travel beyond their region. The dates set out in the document are also subject to change depending on whether the virus flares up again. Meaning there is a possibility of restrictions being reintroduced.
“Unfortunately the risk of a second wave of the virus is ever present,” the Taoiseach said. “So we can only move from one phase to the next if the virus stays under control between each phase. And there is a risk that we’d have to go back a phase if that happens.”

Golf’s national governing bodies – Golf Ireland, the Irish Ladies Golf Union and the Golfing Union of Ireland – are to announce the protocols for clubs next week.
But we know already that no competitions will be allowed and play will be for members only.
Clubs are also being asked to refrain from opening timesheets for booking until the mentioned protocol is published, as it will contain information on group sizes and timesheet intervals.
Mark Kennelly, CEO of Golf Ireland, said: “The golf community in Ireland welcomes the Taoiseach’s confirmation that our clubs can reopen on a restricted basis in the first phase of the Government’s plan to ease the Covid-19 restrictions.
"This means that golf will be one of the first sports to resume and will give golf club members the opportunity to return to play on a limited but safe basis.
“Golf offers the potential to play a significant role in the recovery from this crisis in public health terms. Our sport provides a valuable outlet for healthy outdoor activity which can be enjoyed with the appropriate safety measures in place”.
“We hope that, later in the year, golf can also make a valuable contribution to economic recovery, particularly in the domestic tourism sector.”
“On behalf of the national governing bodies, I want thank the golfers of Ireland for putting the health of their communities and fellow members first during this crisis and to urge them to continue to strictly adhere to the protocols for safe golf which will be finalised shortly and to continue to follow the public health advice of the Government and health authorities.”
“We wish to acknowledge the tremendous efforts being made by frontline workers across Ireland whose commitment and dedication to caring for those inflicted with COVID-19 has led us to a point where we can begin to consider a return to activities such as golf.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Leo Varadkar Offers Glimmer Of Hope Of All-Ireland Taking Place This Year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Leo Varadkar has said the All-Ireland hurling and football championships may go ahead this year, however, it would be run off behind closed doors.
Varadker announced on Friday that the current lockdown would be extended to May 18th and from there the country would move to a five-phase release plan which could result in normality by August 10th depending on targets.
Sport is addressed in each phase of the government’s plan with Phase 2 outlining first that ‘small group team sports training (but not matches) where social distancing can be maintained and where there is no contact’ will be allowed from June 8th.
Phase 3 on June 29th will see “behind closed doors” sporting activities and events permitted where arrangements are in place to enable participants to maintain social distancing.’
However, it is not until Phase 4, on July 20th, where team sports, like GAA and soccer, with limited spectators and social distancing can resume.
The Taoiseach appeared on the Late Late Show to discuss the government’s multi-part plan to reopen the country over the coming months.
“There’s a possibility of an All-Ireland this year,” he told Ryan Tubridy.
“Obviously that’s a matter for the GAA,” he continued. “Not with spectators but it could be done. I think it’s possible. You’d be talking August and September. It’d be a later calendar than we’re used to.”
Croke Park chiefs have not yet commented on the government’s plans while the FAI said they will “move to evaluate the implications and update stakeholders from all strands of football as soon as feasible.”
Meanwhile, the IRFU have said they “welcome the plan set out by the government and will review its implications for our players, clubs and employee group.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">GAA set to resume on July 20 after Taoiseach Varadkar's roadmap announcement</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">TAOISEACH Leo Varadkar last night announced details of a five-stage roadmap out of lockdown – with Gaelic Games set to resume in July as part of phase four of the easing of Covid-19 restrictions.
From July 20, the government says GAA and soccer teams will be allowed resume activities, though only where limitations are placed on the numbers of spectators and where social distancing can be maintained.
The first phase, which starts on May 18, will see the opening of outdoor public sports amenities such as tennis courts and golf courses where social distancing can be maintained, followed by the second phase on June 8 where people will be allowed to engage in outdoor sporting and fitness activities, involving small group team sports training (but not matches) where social distancing can be maintained and where there is no contact.
Phase three, from June 29, will permit "behind closed doors" sporting activities events where arrangements are in place to enable participants to maintain social distancing.
The final phase begins on August 10 and will permit close physical contact sports such as boxing and rugby. Gyms and sports clubs will be opened once effective cleaning has been carried out and social distancing can be maintained.
Mass sports gatherings will only be allowed "in accordance with both indoor and outdoor numbers restrictions".
Last night’s announcement at least offers hope of a return to on-field action, amid fears there could be none in 2020.
From an Ulster perspective, Ulster Council secretary Brian McAvoy – speaking before last night’s announcement – said the provincial body had already considered the prospect of no Ulster Championship this year, and expects the impact of the pandemic to have “a knock-on effect for many years to come”.
“We are planning on the basis that if we get an Ulster Championship, it’ll be a bonus,” said the Burren man.
“Already there are implications. We’ve obviously a number of staff furloughed at the minute, every member of staff who’s not furloughed has taken a pay cut. We have cancelled a number of competitions, we have redrawn the Ulster Minor Football Championship so that, in the event of things getting up and running, it can run with no back door.
“We were due to start the Ulster Championship on the 10th of May, obviously that won’t be happening. But look, this is all up in the air and, in terms of financial implications not only for Ulster GAA but the wider Association, there’s going to be a knock-on effect for many years to come.”
Meanwhile, McAvoy insists any argument in favour of pay for play in the GAA has been “totally put to bed” in the wake of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.
The issue of pay for play has long been a hot topic in the GAA, especially with the rising profile of the inter-county game.
However, McAvoy feels the financial fall-out from the pandemic – and the huge impact it has had upon sport worldwide – proves that the GAA couldn’t sustain “any sort of professional body”.
“The one thing we have in our favour is that while we’ll all take a massive hit, we’re an amateur organisation. That is crucial at this stage,” he said.
“If this has taught us anything, it has totally put to bed any argument that the GAA could sustain any sort of a professional body. That argument’s dead; it always was dead, but for those that needed convincing, they don’t need convincing now.
“If they do they’re living in cloud cuckoo land.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus lockdown has been a mental battle, says Liverpool’s Dejan Lovren</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Staying focused on the Premier League title race during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown has been a mental battle despite all individual efforts to maintain physical fitness, Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren has said.
“It hasn't been easy as we have been locked up in our homes for 46 days now,” the Croatia international told Saturday's online edition of Sportske Novisti, the Balkan nation's leading sports daily.
“The psychological aspect is the most difficult to overome. I work out on my own as much as I can, I kick the ball around a bit with my son on our lawn, but training with the team is totally different,” he said.
The league, which has been suspended since March 9, remains in limbo and unable to take any steps until any government decision next week on possible changes to lockdown restrictions.
All 20 clubs held a conference call on Friday in which they looked at plans for a resumption of training later in May followed by a possible return to competitive action in June.
During the meeting, the clubs were informed that an eventual resumption of matches would only see them play only at neutral venues approved from a health and safety point of view.
Liverpool, who are on the verge of sealing their first league title since 1990, are top of the table on 82 points from 29 games, 25 ahead of second-placed champions Manchester City who have a game in hand.
Lovren acknowledged it was difficult to get excited by the daily routine under the circumstances.
“I try to stay motivated any way I can. I get up in the morning and tell myself 'I am going to get knackered in training today' and at least I've managed to lose some weight,” he said. “But I've also lost some mass on my legs because there is no substitute for a 90-minute team training session. You can't do an indoor exercise on your legs for 90 minutes.”
The 30-year old Bosnian-born centre back also expressed hope the season would resume in a timely manner so as to not disrupt the calendar more than the coronavirus pandemic already has.
“I hope (UEFA President) Aleksander Ceferin and all the other people from UEFA and FIFA will come up with a solution so that we don't get into a situation of having to play 15 games in 30 days,” he said.
“We need time off. This hasn't really been time off because the players will need to recover mentally from the pandemic and the resultant quarantine,” he added.

"We need time off. This hasn't really been time off because the players will need to recover mentally from the pandemic and the resultant quarantine."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus lockdown has been a mental battle, says Lovren</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ZAGREB, May 2 — Staying focused on the Premier League title race during the coronavirus pandemic lockdown has been a mental battle despite all individual efforts to maintain physical fitness, Liverpool defender Dejan Lovren has said.
“It hasn’t been easy as we have been locked up in our homes for 46 days now,” the Croatia international told today’s online edition of Sportske Novisti, the Balkan nation’s leading sports daily.
“The psychological aspect is the most difficult to overome. I work out on my own as much as I can, I kick the ball around a bit with my son on our lawn, but training with the team is totally different.”
The league, which has been suspended since March 9, remains in limbo and unable to take any steps until any government decision next week on possible changes to lockdown restrictions.
All 20 clubs held a conference call yesterday in which they looked at plans for a resumption of training later in May followed by a possible return to competitive action in June.
During the meeting, the clubs were informed that an eventual resumption of matches would only see them play only at neutral venues approved from a health and safety point of view.
Liverpool, who are on the verge of sealing their first league title since 1990, are top of the table on 82 points from 29 games, 25 ahead of second-placed champions Manchester City who have a game in hand.
Lovren acknowledged it was difficult to get excited by the daily routine under the circumstances.
“I try to stay motivated any way I can. I get up in the morning and tell myself ‘I am going to get knackered in training today’ and at least I’ve managed to lose some weight,” he said.
“But I’ve also lost some mass on my legs because there is no substitute for a 90-minute team training session. You can’t do an indoor exercise on your legs for 90 minutes.”
The 30-year old Bosnian-born centre back also expressed hope the season would resume in a timely manner so as to not disrupt the calendar more than the coronavirus pandemic already has.
“I hope (Uefa President) Aleksander Ceferin and all the other people from Uefa and Fifa will come up with a solution so that we don’t get into a situation of having to play 15 games in 30 days,” he said.
“We need time off. This hasn’t really been time off because the players will need to recover mentally from the pandemic and the resultant quarantine.” — Reuters

“I have discussions with my officers. We are planning out a way to start functioning as soon as possible. I thought, first of all, we should allow practice for the players who have qualified for the Olympics and who will be participating in the qualifiers or important championships. We can’t open all the coaching centres, so we will allow only for elite athletes. Junior camps have to wait for some time as safety will be priority,” he concluded.
Indian boxers have already secured a record nine qualification quotas at Tokyo Olympics and will be fighting for four more places in the upcoming qualification tournaments.
He further interacted with the boxers to know their situation during the lockdown and training schedules said Asian Games gold medallist Vikas Krishnan.
“Whatever we have achieved today, credit goes to the coaches, federation and the government. It”s really impressive and motivating to interact with you sir (Rijiju). If we keep getting support from the government, we will definitely win Olympic medals, World Championship medals,” Krishnan said.
A couple of days back, Rijuju interacted with elite kabaddi players and coaches via video conference and said that he would look to push the sport in the Olympics in the future.

Indian boxers have already secured a record nine qualification quotas at Tokyo Olympics and will be fighting for four more places in the upcoming qualification tournaments.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India to step up battle for 2032 Olympics after pandemic: sports chief</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India will step up its battle to win the 2032 Olympic Games and other international events when the global coronavirus pandemic eases, its top sports leader Narinder Batra told AFP.
Ten years after hosting the Commonwealth Games, the Indian Olympic Association president said his country had lessons to learn but would not be deterred.
“We are serious and definitely pitching for the 2026 Youth Olympic Games and the 2032 Olympics,” he said on Friday.
India has already written expressions of interest to the International Olympic Committee but faces reported competition from Thailand, Russia and Colombia for the 2026 event.
Queensland in Australia, Shanghai and a potential joint bid between Seoul and Pyongyang are also being touted for the 2032 Olympics.
However, the pandemic has halted all debate. Batra, also head of the International Hockey Federation, said “documentation” has started for 2032 but work is now frozen. A final decision may take until 2025.
“Now there is a team that visits the various venues and you keep talking to them and then they submit a report. It is a continuous process which I believe will see no activity until December,” India's most influential sports leader said.
“This is not the time to talk with business houses or government about pitching for the Olympics. The first thing should be how we sort out this problem which has come into the world,” Batra added, referring to the virus.
Delhi's hosting of the Commonwealth Games was marked by construction delays, failing infrastructure and accusations of financial mismanagement.
More recently, Delhi was stripped of the 2021 world boxing championships, with the global body accusing organisers of failing to pay a hosting fee on time.
Batra said he knew nothing of the boxing dispute but insisted that the 2010 multi-sport event had made India think big and its growing economic clout means it has resources.
“I can say the biggest takeaway was that India is capable of hosting all big-ticket events whether it is Olympics or any other Games,” said Batra.
But he added that New Delhi did not capitalise enough on the 2010 Games by encouraging more young athletes.
“The Delhi event fell short on legacy values. The legacy that you produce more athletes and you develop them never happened here and that is why tournaments shifted out of Delhi,” he said.
“The fact that such a big event happened here was not properly exploited.”
India has a population of 1.3 billion people but while it excels at cricket, its team returned from the 2016 Rio Olympics with just two medals.
The coronavirus pandemic has only made it harder for athletes to train for the postponed Tokyo Olympics, put back until at least 2021.
But Batra is sticking to his prediction that India will get more than 10 medals whenever the next Games are held.
“About 80 Indian athletes have already qualified for the Olympics and are being monitored by directors and chief coaches,” he said.
“So I maintain my earlier prediction of a double-figure medal tally and I don't think this situation will change anything.”
Batra said he was counting on the men's hockey team — which has won eight Olympic golds but not finished in the first four since 1980 — to return to success.
“In this Olympics I am certainly looking to the men's team for a medal,” he said.

Batra said he was counting on the men’s hockey team — which has won eight Olympic golds but not finished in the first four since 1980 — to return to success.
“In this Olympics I am certainly looking to the men’s team for a medal,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Definitely pitching for the 2026 Youth Olympics and the 2032 Olympics: IOA chief Narinder Batra</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India will step up its battle to win the 2032 Olympic Games and other international events when the global coronavirus pandemic eases, said Indian Olympic Association president Narinder Batra.
Ten years after hosting the Commonwealth Games, Batra said his country had lessons to learn but would not be deterred.
“We are serious and definitely pitching for the 2026 Youth Olympic Games and the 2032 Olympics,” he said Friday.
India has already written expressions of interest to the International Olympic Committee but faces reported competition from Thailand, Russia and Colombia for the 2026 event.
Queensland in Australia, Shanghai and a potential joint bid between Seoul and Pyongyang are also being touted for the 2032 Olympics.
However, the pandemic has halted all debate. Batra, also head of the International Hockey Federation, said “documentation” has started for 2032 but work is now frozen. A final decision may take until 2025.
“Now there is a team that visits the various venues and you keep talking to them and then they submit a report. It is a continuous process which I believe will see no activity until December,” India’s most influential sports leader said.
“This is not the time to talk with business houses or government about pitching for the Olympics. The first thing should be how we sort out this problem which has come into the world,” Batra added, referring to the virus.
Delhi’s hosting of the Commonwealth Games was marked by construction delays, failing infrastructure and accusations of financial mismanagement.
More recently, Delhi was stripped of the 2021 world boxing championships, with the global body accusing organisers of failing to pay a hosting fee on time.
Batra said he knew nothing of the boxing dispute but insisted that the 2010 multi-sport event had made India think big and its growing economic clout means it has resources.
“I can say the biggest takeaway was that India is capable of hosting all big-ticket events whether it is Olympics or any other Games,” said Batra.
But he added that New Delhi did not capitalise enough on the 2010 Games by encouraging more young athletes.
“The Delhi event fell short on legacy values. The legacy that you produce more athletes and you develop them never happened here and that is why tournaments shifted out of Delhi,” he said.
“The fact that such a big event happened here was not properly exploited.”
India has a population of 1.3 billion people but while it excels at cricket, its team returned from the 2016 Rio Olympics with just two medals.
The coronavirus pandemic has only made it harder for athletes to train for the postponed Tokyo Olympics, put back until at least 2021.
But Batra is sticking to his prediction that India will get more than 10 medals whenever the next Games are held.
“About 80 Indian athletes have already qualified for the Olympics and are being monitored by directors and chief coaches,” he said.
“So I maintain my earlier prediction of a double-figure medal tally and I don’t think this situation will change anything.”
Batra said he was counting on the men’s hockey team – which has won eight Olympic golds but not finished in the top four since 1980 – to return to success.
“In this Olympics, I am certainly looking to the men’s team for a medal,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">India to Bid For 2032 Olympics Hosting Rights: IOA President Narinder Batra</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">President of the Indian Olympic Association Narinder Batra has confirmed that India will bid for acquiring the hosting rights of the 2032 Olympics. Having hosted the Commonwealth Games which was a commercial success, it was one marred with controversy, and although India is yet to host a major world event since, Batra said India will try and bag the biggest sporting event in the world, having taken the 2010 CWG learnings into consideration.

“We are serious and definitely pitching for the 2026 Youth Olympic Games and the 2032 Olympics,” Batra told AFP Friday. Also Read - No Foreign Training For Indian Athletes Till End Of This Year
However, before India throw their name in the hat, Batra said the COVID-19 pandemic needs to come under control. Batra informed the documentation process for 2032 Olympics has begun but is currently frozen due to the global pandemic. India have written to the Indian Olympics Association expressing their interest in hosting the events, but are reportedly facing competition from Thailand, Russia and Colombia for the Youth Games.

“Now there is a team that visits the various venues and you keep talking to them and then they submit a report. It is a continuous process which I believe will see no activity until December,” Batra said. “This is not the time to talk with business houses or government about pitching for the Olympics. The first thing should be how we sort out this problem which has come into the world.”
India recently lost the hosting rights for the 2021 World Boxing Championships for not providing visa to shooters from Pakistan for the 2020 World Cup due to political tensions between two countries. And while India ran the risk of losing out future events because of this, Batra feels quite the opposite.
“I can say the biggest takeaway was that India is capable of hosting all big-ticket events whether it is Olympics or any other Games,” he said.

Written By Press Trust Of India | Mumbai | Updated On: May 03, 2020 07:45 IST
IOC member and IOA president Narinder Batra on Saturday said that the postponed 2020 Tokyo Olympics will "definitely" be held next year, amid concerns over staging the mega event before a COVID-19 vaccine is found. Some eminent scientists and doctors have expressed doubts on the holding of the Tokyo Olympics if a vaccine is not found by then. Even the Japan Medical Association president said it would only be possible for the Olympics to go ahead in July 2021 if the infections were under control, not only in Japan, but globally. International Olympic Committee's (IOC) coordination commission for the Tokyo Olympics, John Coates of Australia had, however, disagreed with suggestions that a vaccine for COVID-19 is needed to hold the Games.
Batra was elected as president of International Hockey Federation (FIH) in November 2016 and became an IOC member in June last year. He has been at the helm of IOA since December 2017. He said his tenure as FIH chief has been extended till June next year as the elections scheduled to be held in October this year has been postponed to June next year in view of the unprecedented situation arising out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Batra also said some 140-odd National Olympic Committees were to hold their elections within two-three months of the original (2020) date of Tokyo Olympics and they have been allowed by the IOC to hold the polls next year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lockdown a Big Setback for Olympic-Bound Athletes: Gagan Narang</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Shooter Gagan Narang has voiced his concerns towards Tokyo-bound Olympics, believing their preparations for the Olympics Games next year have been severely affected due to the nationwide lockdown imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the postponement of the Summer Games has been a blessing a disguise for some, Narang reckons there are many, especially those who have qualified for the event, for whom the postponement, couple with the lockdown couldn’t have come at a worse time.

“For those preparing for Olympics, the lockdown is definitely a setback,” Narang told Times of India. “But I have spoken to several sportspersons and my trainees. They have started adjusting to the situation. When there are highs, there will be lows too. They have started to find solutions. Some are pursuing their hobbies. Hitherto, because of their tight schedule, they never had time to focus on hobbies. Dhanush Srikanth is painting, which is his pastime. Some others have started singing, cooking etc.” Also Read - Expectations of Olympic Medal Serves as Motivation Than Pressure: Manpreet Singh
As far as shooting is concerned, the National Rifle Association of India (NRAI) last month decided that there will be no further trials, and are expected to announce India’s shooting contingent for the Olympics. 2019 was a year where a total of 15 shooting quotas for the Summer Games were sealed and with the overall medal tally standing at 21 gold, six silver and three bronze, India was on top of all Rifle-Pistol World Cups and Finals.
“It would be a mixed feeling for the record 15 prospective Olympians, who had qualified for the 2020 Tokyo Games now postponed to 2021. It’s a big setback for shooters who have prepared really hard for the Games because they need to prepare all over again,” Narang, who has represented India in four consecutive Olympics Games explained.
Meanwhile, at Narang’s Gun For Glory academy, the shooter admits to at times, being part of online sessions. The 36-year-old shooter doesn’t mind the lockdown much as it has provided him a break and a chance to be with his folks.
“I have been shooting for the last two decades and the hectic schedule kept me away from my parents. My father, Bhimsen Narang, who is a retired chief manager in Air India, and mother Amarjit Narang, are 75. Luckily, only some age-related issues, but I was able to spend time with them. In the last 20 years, this is the longest I’ve been at home and savoured home cooked food. I’m fortunate to be spending time with them after all these years,” Gagan said.
“Generally, sportspersons are very positive. It’s rare to find a sportsperson without his/her share of sorrow or defeats. They face numerous challenges and need to find solutions in everyday life. Staying positive is the mantra for any sportsperson and it will keep them in good stead.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus US sport shutdown will cost $12 billion: report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York: The $100 billion US sports landscape will lose $12 billion in revenue due to the coronavirus shutdown, ESPN reported Friday, with deeper cuts if NFL and college gridiron games are wiped out.
Analysis of the magnitude of business losses includes superstar salaries to pay for stadium workers but it might be a conservative estimate because it does not include outdoor recreational sport, gambling or such individual sports as golf, tennis and NASCAR, the most popular form of US auto racing.
Patrick Rishe, sports business program director at Washington University in St. Louis, estimated the impact of the shutdown on major US pro and college sports leagues as well as youth sport for ESPN, which also had labor market analysis firm Emsi make sport-related job estimates.
Rishe estimated US pro sports would lose $5.5 billion from the shutdown while college sports would lose $3.9 billion and youth sport tourism would fall by $2.4 billion.
And those figures assume Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer can finish half of their scheduled seasons with spectators while the NBA and the National Hockey League cancel the unfinished part of their regular seasons and stage playoff games without spectators with youth sports resuming in July.
None of that is assured given the stay-at-home orders remaining in place over most of the nation as a result of the deadly virus that has killed more than 63,000 people in the United States and infected more than one million.
"As an economist, you stand back, you look at the carnage that's taking place - dumbfounded, awestruck, mind-numbing. All of those phrases, they're all relevant becaus we just have never seen anything on this scale," Rishe told ESPN.
Figures include $3.25 billion that would have been spent by spectators on pro sports plus $371 million of income for stadium and arena workers and $2.2 billion in US television rights fees.
An NFL wipe out would cost more than $11.5 billion in television revenue while 65 major collegiate American football programs receive about $4 billion in TV money, about half the income that finances all athletic department budgets.
There are three million jobs nationwide that depend upon sports, from ushers and guards to scouts and trainers, according to the report.
Rishe said that should MLB play without spectators for half a season for its 162-games-a-team schedule, over $2 billion more in game-day fan spending would be lost.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus US Sport Shutdown Will Cost $12 Billion: Report</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The $100 billion US sports landscape will lose $12 billion in revenue due to the coronavirus shutdown, ESPN reported Friday, with deeper cuts if NFL and college gridiron games are wiped out. Analysis of the magnitude of business losses includes superstar salaries to pay for stadium workers but it might be a conservative estimate because it does not include outdoor recreational sport, gambling or such individual sports as golf, tennis and NASCAR, the most popular form of US auto racing.
Patrick Rishe, sports business program director at Washington University in St. Louis, estimated the impact of the shutdown on major US pro and college sports leagues as well as youth sport for ESPN, which also had labor market analysis firm Emsi make sport-related job estimates.
Rishe estimated US pro sports would lose $5.5 billion from the shutdown while college sports would lose $3.9 billion and youth sport tourism would fall by $2.4 billion.
And those figures assume Major League Baseball and Major League Soccer can finish half of their scheduled seasons with spectators while the NBA and the National Hockey League cancel the unfinished part of their regular seasons and stage playoff games without spectators with youth sports resuming in July.
None of that is assured given the stay-at-home orders remaining in place over most of the nation as a result of the deadly virus that has killed more than 63,000 people in the United States and infected more than one million.
"As an economist, you stand back, you look at the carnage that's taking place -- dumbfounded, awestruck, mind-numbing. All of those phrases, they're all relevant because we just have never seen anything on this scale," Rishe told ESPN.
Figures include $3.25 billion that would have been spent by spectators on pro sports plus $371 million of income for stadium and arena workers and $2.2 billion in US television rights fees.
An NFL wipe out would cost more than $11.5 billion in television revenue while 65 major collegiate American football programs receive about $4 billion in TV money, about half the income that finances all athletic department budgets.
There are three million jobs nationwide that depend upon sports, from ushers and guards to scouts and trainers, according to the report.
Rishe said that should MLB play without spectators for half a season for its 162-games-a-team schedule, over $2 billion more in game-day fan spending would be lost.

    <h5 class="mb-1">De Bruyne to consider City future if European ban is upheld</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin De Bruyne has admitted he will consider his future if Manchester City's two-year ban from European competition stands, but suggested he could stay at the Etihad Stadium even if he faced a year out of the Champions League.
City were hit with the ban for "serious breaches" of UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations but have appealed against the punishment to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
There has been much speculation over the future of key players such as De Bruyne if the ban stands, but the Belgium international said he trusted the club as they insist they have done nothing wrong and can get the ban overturned.
"I'm just waiting," De Bruyne said in an interview with Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. "The club told us they are going to appeal and they are almost 100 hundred per cent sure they are right. That's why I'm waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team.
"Once the decision is made, I will review everything. Two years would be long, but in the case of one year I might see."
Remove a European ban from the equation, and De Bruyne said he had no reason to want to leave Manchester, even if the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona came knocking.
"I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England - for my competitive view the best competition - and I like that," the 28-year-old said.
"It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too."
De Bruyne has three years remaining on his current City contract but manager Pep Guardiola will be entering the final year of his own deal next season.
But De Bruyne said his future did not depend on the Catalan's.
"I think Pep said he will take his year anyway no matter what. Then his contract ends," he said. "But I'm not going to let my decision depend on what Pep is doing.
"Of course I have already worked with other trainers and when Pep leaves, I have to continue working with someone else. But I haven't really paid much attention to that for the time being. There are more important things at the moment."
The Premier League has been suspended for six weeks due to the coronavirus, but De Bruyne said he was sure the season would be finished.
"My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks," he said. "The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something. Everything will be finished without fans I think. That is not really interesting for anyone, but this season will be finished.
"The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems."
Asked about comments from his City team-mate Sergio Aguero, who said some players were scared to return due to the threat of the virus, De Bruyne said: "I don't think people are really afraid for themselves, but for their family. That is mainly the problem for many people."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kevin de Bruyne might consider Man City future if club’s Uefa Champions League ban is upheld</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With his club handed a two-year ban from European football by Uefa heard by the Court of Arbitration before the start of next season’s Champions League, Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne admitted he would be forced to consider his future.
City’s has vowed to fight the sanction imposed by Uefa on February 14 for breaching financial fair play regulations.
“Once we know more, I will make a decision. Two years without playing in Europe would be long but in the case of one year I might see,” he said.
De Bruyne also said he was optimistic about City’s participation in next season’s Champions League. Uefa has banned the club from European competition for the next two years for “serious breaches” of financial fair-play rules.
“The club told us they’re going to appeal and that they’re almost certain to get their way. I’m waiting to see what happens, but I trust my club,” said de Bruyne.
The 28-year-old Belgium international believes the Premier League season will be finished despite the coronavirus pandemic “because the financial aspect is far too important”.
“My feeling is that we may be able to train again within two weeks. The government wants to restart football as soon as possible to give people something. I think this season will be finished,” de Bruyne told Belgian daily Het Laatste Nieuws.
“The financial aspect is far too important in the Premier League. If the season is not finished, it will cause serious problems,” he added.
Clubs were presented with the league’s “Project Restart” plans at a meeting on Friday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-2020 season must be played at neutral venues.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man City morning headlines as Kevin De Bruyne drops hint over future</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">De Bruyne hints at City stay
Playmaker Kevin De Bruyne has hinted his long-term future lies at Manchester City despite the club’s European ban, which is pending an appeal.
The Belgian did admit that two years out of European competition ‘would be long’ and claimed that if the ban would be reduced to just one season, it would be much more palatable for the players.
Speaking to HLN, he explained: "I'm just waiting. The club has told us that they are going to appeal and that they are almost one hundred percent sure that they are right. That's why I'm waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team.
"Once the statement is made, I will review everything. Two years would be long, in the case of one year I might see.
“In recent years, and before then too, there have been many teams who have polled and may have asked what I like. But to be honest, I'm very happy with City.
"I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England - for my view the best competition - and I like that. It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too. What is coming is coming. But it's not that I've tried to leave City in those five years. I have also remained calm for my previous transfers. I have never had any problems and have always waited for my moment. With respect, because I think you get most of it back. Even outside of football.”
Matondo reveals Sane’s Schalke advise
Teenage winger Rabbi Matondo left City in January 2019 to join Schalke and he has revealed Leroy Sane, formerly of the Bundesliga club, advised him on the move.
The Wales international moved to Germany in an £8million deal and has scored once in 20 appearances for the club, whom he joined in search of first-team football.
"At Manchester City, I was doing well and getting a lot of attention from other clubs, telling me they wanted me in the first team. I wasn't really in and around the first team at City so much. I wasn't getting a sniff of being on the bench," Matondo told the Daily Mail.
"Manchester City is a top club and I've lots of respect for them. At the time I was thinking about my own development and thought a move abroad might be the one for me.
"There was a lot of talk at the time about how not many young players were breaking through in the Premier League and I was thinking it might be right to move abroad and get some good experience. Maybe some life lessons as well.
"Not a lot of people can say they moved abroad to work at 18 and lived alone. I thought it would be good for me. I thought I was mature and it's been the right thing for me.
"He (Sane) told me the fans were top fans and would love me forever if I worked hard and did the right things. He gave me advice on the Schalke way."
Aguero reveals key dietary change
City record goalscorer Sergio Aguero has revealed how he used to suffer dizzy spells on the pitch before altering his diet.
Aguero ditched the prime Argentine beef which was a big part of his previous diet and upon receiving advice, opted to consume more chicken and rice.
The 31-year-old now only uses the asado – a traditional South American grill – once a week or less, and he feels all the better for it.
Aguero told TYC Sports: “I think it was from 2013 to 2016 that I could not adapt to food well.
“From there I met an Italian doctor online - and he changed my mind a little.
“I told him what I usually ate, which was to eat a lot of meat, and when he told me to try it just once a week I was like 'uhhh'.
“Then I adapted. He told me that when I am very hungry I should put rice and chicken together – and today I am a big fan of rice.
“In football, even if it's only half-a-kilo, you feel the difference. It is incredible."

    <h5 class="mb-1">De Bruyne warns he could leave Man City if ban is upheld</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin de Bruyne has admitted he may have to consider his future at Manchester City if the club's two-year Champions League ban is upheld.
City were suspended from European competition for the next two seasons by UEFA in February for "serious breaches" of Financial Fair Play rules, a ruling they are taking to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
The Belgium midfielder, 28, said he would have to consider leaving if the ban was upheld. The admission is likely to put a host of Europe's top clubs on alert, including Real Madrid, Barcelona and Juventus.
"I'm just waiting a little bit," de Bruyne told the Het Laatse Nieuws and VTM television in Belgium. "The club has told us that they will appeal. And they are 100 per cent convinced that they are in the right. I have confidence in my club. If they are saying it's true, then I believe them.
"We'll wait and see what happens. Once there's a final decision I will look at it. Two years [without Champions League football] would be long. One year is something I might be able to cope with."
Pep Guardiola, the City manager, has vowed to see out his contract with the club, which expires in June next year, even if they lose their appeal. But de Bruyne said his own future was not linked to what Guardiola might do.
"I think Pep has said that he'll stay until the end of next year whatever happens next," de Bruyne said. "I think his contract is running out then. We'll have to wait. But I'm not going to make a decision based on what he does, of course. I have already worked under other managers."
De Bruyne has three years left on his contract, which expires in June 2023 and is worth around £350,000(around $A680,000) a week including bonuses. He said there had been no formal discussions about an extension.
"I don't know what will happen. We are a bit in limbo with all what's happening now in the world," he said. "I still have three years left. When the season is finally finished, there might come an opportunity to look at the future. It's not the moment to think about it right now."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Man City superstar could stay even if Champions League ban is upheld</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">In what is potentially some good news among the enveloping gloom at Man City, one of their superstar players has hinted that he could still stay at the club, even if their Champions League ban is upheld.
According to an interview with HLN and cited by the Manchester Evening News, Kevin De Bruyne will consider staying at the Etihad Stadium if the ban is reduced to one year rather than the current two that Pep Guardiola’s side have hanging over them.
“I’m just waiting. The club has told us that they are going to appeal and that they is (sic) almost one hundred percent sure that they are right. That’s why I’m waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team,” he said.
“Once the statement is made, I will review everything. Two years would be long, in the case of one year I might see.
“[…] I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England – for my competitive view the best competition – and I like that. It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too. What is coming is coming. But it’s not that I’ve tried to leave City in those five years. I have also remained calm for my previous transfers.”
The outlet go on to suggest that the Belgian does want to win European club football’s glamour trophy, and to that end, a two-year hiatus for a 28-year-old may prove unworkable, but City’s supporters will surely be delighted with the attacking midfielder’s current stance.
At this point the messages remain mixed, and that is perhaps understandable with the business of football completely up in the air at the moment because of the coronavirus crisis.
One things is almost certain, however, and that is that City seem to be a much better proposition with De Bruyne in their team than without him, and it’s not too much of a stretch to believe that City will do all they can to try and keep hold of him.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kevin De Bruyne admits European ban could force him to leave Manchester City</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin De Bruyne has admitted he will consider his future if Manchester City’s two-year ban from European competition stands, but suggested he could stay at the Etihad Stadium even if he faced a year out of the Champions League.
City were hit with the ban for “serious breaches” of Uefa’s Financial Fair Play regulations but have appealed against the punishment to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
There has been much speculation over the future of key players such as De Bruyne if the ban stands, but the Belgium international said he trusted the club as they insist they have done nothing wrong and can get the ban overturned.
“I’m just waiting,” De Bruyne said in an interview with Belgian newspaper Het Laatste Nieuws. “The club told us they are going to appeal and they are almost 100 hundred per cent sure they are right. That’s why I’m waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team.
“Once the decision is made, I will review everything. Two years would be long, but in the case of one year I might see.”
Remove a European ban from the equation, and De Bruyne said he had no reason to want to leave Manchester, even if the likes of Real Madrid and Barcelona came knocking.
“I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England — for my competitive view the best competition — and I like that,” the 28-year-old said. “It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too.”
De Bruyne has three years remaining on his current City contract but manager Pep Guardiola will be entering the final year of his own deal next season. But De Bruyne said his future did not depend on the Catalan’s.
“I think Pep said he will take his year anyway no matter what. Then his contract ends,” he said. “But I’m not going to let my decision depend on what Pep is doing.
“Of course I have already worked with other trainers and when Pep leaves, I have to continue working with someone else. But I haven’t really paid much attention to that for the time being. There are more important things at the moment.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kevin De Bruyne says he could quit Man City if Champions League ban is upheld</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin De Bruyne has hinted that he could quit Manchester City if the club's Champions League ban is upheld.
The Belgian international insists that his future at the Etihad will NOT be shaped by whether Pep Guardiola decides to sign a new contract to stay at the club.
But he has revealed his concern over UEFA's decision to ban the Blues from Europe for two seasons for breaking FFP regulations.
And De Bruyne has admitted for the first time that it might have a bearing on where he will spend the peak years of his career.
De Bruyne said: “I'm just waiting. The club has told us that they are going to appeal - and that they are almost 100 percent sure that they are right.
“That's why I'm waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team.
“Once the statement is made, I will review everything.
“Two years would be long. In the case of one year I might see.”
De Bruyne, talking on a video call with Belgian publication HLN, was asked about whether Guardiola's plans would affect his future.
The Catalan is out of contract in the summer of 2021, but the midfielder replied: “Not particularly.
“I think Pep said he will be here next year anyway, no matter what.
“Then his contract ends. But I'm not going to let my decision depend on what Pep is doing.
“Of course I have already worked with other trainers and when Pep leaves, I have to continue working with someone else.
“But I haven't really paid much attention to that for the time being.
“There are more important things at the moment.”
There will be no shortage of takers should De Bruyne decide to leave Manchester if City's ban is confirmed when the Court of Arbitration for Sport hears their appeal.
Real Madrid and Barcelona are big admirers, while Bayern Munich tried to land the 28-year-old before he joined City in a £55million deal from Wolfsburg in the summer of 2015.
He was outstanding when City beat Madrid 2-1 in the Bernabeu in the Champions League in March, captaining the side and scoring the winner from the penalty spot.
De Bruyne said: “To be honest, I'm very happy with City. 
“I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England - for my competitive view the best competition - and I like that.
“It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too.
“What is coming is coming. But it's not that I've tried to leave City in those five years.
“I have also remained calm for my previous transfers.
“I have never had any problems and have always waited for my moment.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kevin de Bruyne hints at Man City stay even if club are banned from Champions League</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kevin de Bruyne says he would consider staying at Manchester City for a season even if their ban from UEFA competition is upheld.
City were given a two-year ban by UEFA in February for breaching Financial Fair Play regulations, and immediately announced their intention to appeal the ruling. They have since submitted that appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and have always maintained confidence that the decision will be overturned on an independent investigation.
However, the possibility of having no Champions League football could see the club's best players look to leave in order to play in Europe's premier club competition.
De Bruyne has ambitions of winning the Champions League, and fans have been concerned that he could seek a move away from the club this summer if they are not eligible to play in the competition.
Speaking to HLN, De Bruyne said that a two-year absence from Europe could see him look to leave, but that a one year break could be manageable.
"I'm just waiting. The club has told us that they are going to appeal and that they is almost one hundred percent sure that they are right. That's why I'm waiting to see what will happen. I trust my team," he said.
"Once the statement is made, I will review everything. Two years would be long, in the case of one year I might see."
When pressed on whether De Bruyne would look to join a club like Real Madrid or Barcelona, he reaffirmed his happiness at City.
“In recent years, and before then too, there have been many teams who have polled and may have asked what I like. But to be honest, I'm very happy with City," he continued.
"I play for one of the best teams in the world, play in England - for my competitive view the best competition - and I like that. It remains a challenge to be the best and I need that too. What is coming is coming. But it's not that I've tried to leave City in those five years. I have also remained calm for my previous transfers. I have never had any problems and have always waited for my moment. With respect, because I think you get most of it back. Even outside of football. ”
The news will be welcome to City fans, and De Bruyne also confirmed that his future at the Etihad will not depend on whether manager Pep Guardiola stays at the club past his current deal that runs until 2021.
"I think Pep said he will take his year anyway no matter what. Then his contract ends. But I'm not going to let my decision depend on what Pep is doing. Of course I have already worked with other trainers and when Pep leaves, I have to continue working with someone else. But I haven't really paid much attention to that for the time being. There are more important things at the moment."

Welcome to what the world of tennis could look like once government restrictions caused by the coronavirus pandemic have been lifted. 
On Friday, the International Tennis Federation (ITF), issued a set of guidelines for local and national-level competitions.
"They emphasize that decisions made by governments take precedence and that tennis (either competitive or recreational) should not be played until governments have sufficiently relaxed any restrictions that are currently in place," said an ITF statement.
The guidelines include arriving at a venue already dressed and leaving immediately after the conclusion of a match.
"Do not use the locker rooms or showers," say the ITF.
Masks are to be worn while off-court, players and officials should maintain at least two meters between each other while handshakes are also off-limits.
Each player is asked to use their own set of balls - separately numbered. 
Ball boys and girls to wear rubber gloves while at changeovers, players must go around opposite sides of the net.
Players are also discouraged from signing autographs and from taking selfies while being warned not share equipment, water bottles or food.
Tournaments should also only be singles and played without spectators.
"While following measures such as these will ensure that the risk from COVID-19 is minimized, the guidelines are clear that the risk cannot be eliminated altogether," added the ITF.
The professional ATP and WTA tours have been suspended since mid-March and are not expected to resume until July 13 at the earliest.

Each player is asked to use their own set of balls - separately numbered.
Ball boys and girls to wear rubber gloves while at changeovers, players must go around opposite sides of the net.
Players are also discouraged from signing autographs and from taking selfies while being warned not share equipment, water bottles or food.
Tournaments should also only be singles and played without spectators.
"While following measures such as these will ensure that the risk from COVID-19 is minimised, the guidelines are clear that the risk cannot be eliminated altogether," added the ITF.
The professional ATP and WTA tours have been suspended since mid-March and are not expected to resume until Jul 13 at the earliest.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS — Formula One hopes to finally start the season with a double-header in the naturally isolated environment around the venue for the Austrian Grand Prix.
Despite the first 10 races having been canceled or postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, the targeted start date is July 5 in Austria. F1 still envisages holding 15 to 18 of the 22 scheduled Grands Prix.
One way to make up for lost time is having consecutive weekends on one circuit, like the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg. F1 manager director of motorsports Ross Brawn says this is a “real consideration” so long as iron-tight safety regulations are met.
“One of the logistical challenges is getting everyone tested and cleared to enter the racing environment," he told an official F1 podcast. "We can contain everyone within that environment, and therefore once we are there it is appealing to have another race the following week."
The Red Bull Ring's location in the Styrian mountains makes it naturally isolated.
“It’s pretty challenging to find the right sort of races early on where we can control the environment well enough to ensure the safety of everyone," Brawn added. “Austria fits that bill very well. It has a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It’s not too close to a metropolis.”
It is unclear where F1 would race after Austria, if it even goes ahead.
The British GP is set to follow on July 19 and organizers are talking to the government about the viability of holding that race without fans. Silverstone would also reportedly be able to hold consecutive races.
The season could then continue later in the summer in Hungary, where the Hungaroring circuit is nestled in the countryside outside Budapest; and Belgium, whose Spa-Francorchamps track is within the Ardennes forest. The idea is then to move into Eurasia, Asia, and the Americas before concluding with Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in the Gulf.
“It’s important for us to try and get the season going. One reason is to excite the fans," Brawn said. "But it is (also) a very important livelihood for thousands of people.”
Guenther Steiner, the team principal of the Haas F1 team, cautiously argued in favor of giving Austria the green light.
“I think Austria is a very good place to start," Steiner said Friday in a video interview. "They have got the disease well under control at the moment and we just need to make sure that we don’t bring it back.”
Steiner also thinks consecutive races could be held there.
“I think it’s realistic. I don’t know so much about what is coming after,” he said. "Let’s hope we can get official (clearance) and we get also a good follow-up plan.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus: Formula One plans for 'isolated environment' to launch season in Austria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Formula One managing director Ross Brawn said the Austrian Grand Prix’s remote location makes it a logical choice as the opening race of a season heavily interrupted by the coronavirus pandemic.
Organisers are aiming to start the championship, which was put on hold in March hours before the scheduled season-opener in Australia, with consecutive races at the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg on July 5 and 12.
“One of the logistical challenges is getting everyone tested and cleared to enter the racing environment,” Brawn told the F1 Nation podcast. “Once we do that, it’s very attractive to keep everyone in that environment, within that biosphere that we want to create, for another race.
“It’s also pretty challenging to find the right sort of races early on where we can control the environment well enough to ensure the safety of everyone. Austria fits that bill very well. It has a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It’s not too close to a metropolis.
“It has a great infrastructure around it. For instance, there will be no motorhomes, but there will be full catering facility laid on that the circuit has. We can contain everyone within that environment and therefore once we are there it is appealing to have another race the following week,” he added.
Earlier this week, Formula One boss Chase Carey targeted the season starting in Austria after the French Grand Prix, scheduled for June 28 was cancelled, becoming the 10th race of the season to be scrapped or postponed.
The Austrian Grand Prix will only be given the green light on the condition it is raced behind closed doors, the country’s health minister told organisers on Wednesday.
“Unfortunately it will be without fans, which is a great shame, but we still feel we can take the race out to all the fans and watchers on TV and other means,” said Brawn.
“It’s important for us to try and get the season going, many reasons for wanting to start the season. One is to excite the fans, who have all been frustrated with the delays. We have a very exciting season in front of us, but it is a very important livelihood for thousands of people - and that is another reason for trying to kickstart the season.”
Organisers also announced Friday the Hungarian Grand Prix on August 2 will be staged without fans in response to the health crisis. The race at the Hungaroring is following the example set by the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, scheduled for July 19.
“It has now become clear that we cannot hold the Hungarian Grand Prix in front of spectators despite all our efforts,” a statement from race organisers said.
The statement added that this decision was necessary to protect the health of fans and circuit staff alike. Their hand was forced after the Hungarian government banned any event involving more than 500 spectators until August 15.
“It became clear yesterday (Thursday) that all this is only possible behind closed gates. We will continue to work with the international promoter to find the best possible solution,” the statement added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">F1 hopes to start season with double-header in Austria</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS (AP) - Formula One hopes to finally start the season with a double-header in the naturally isolated environment around the venue for the Austrian Grand Prix.
Despite the first 10 races having been canceled or postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic, the targeted start date is July 5 in Austria. F1 still envisages holding 15 to 18 of the 22 scheduled Grands Prix.
One way to make up for lost time is having consecutive weekends on one circuit, like the Red Bull Ring in Spielberg. F1 manager director of motorsports Ross Brawn says this is a “real consideration” so long as iron-tight safety regulations are met.
“One of the logistical challenges is getting everyone tested and cleared to enter the racing environment,” he told an official F1 podcast. “We can contain everyone within that environment, and therefore once we are there it is appealing to have another race the following week.”
The Red Bull Ring’s location in the Styrian mountains makes it naturally isolated.
“It’s pretty challenging to find the right sort of races early on where we can control the environment well enough to ensure the safety of everyone,” Brawn added. “Austria fits that bill very well. It has a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It’s not too close to a metropolis.”
It is unclear where F1 would race after Austria, if it even goes ahead.
The British GP is set to follow on July 19 and organizers are talking to the government about the viability of holding that race without fans. Silverstone would also reportedly be able to hold consecutive races.
The season could then continue later in the summer in Hungary, where the Hungaroring circuit is nestled in the countryside outside Budapest; and Belgium, whose Spa-Francorchamps track is within the Ardennes forest. The idea is then to move into Eurasia, Asia, and the Americas before concluding with Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in the Gulf.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Maradona was pure art, Messi is a Speedy Gonzales - Ayala</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Diego Maradona was "pure art" and Lionel Messi is "a Speedy Gonzales", according to Argentina assistant coach Roberto Ayala.
Ayala played alongside Maradona at the start of his career and in his twilight years lined up with Messi.
The former Napoli, Milan and Valencia centre-back believes there are significant differences between the two players widely regarded as the best to have come out of Argentina.
"I played with both of them, with Diego I was taking my first steps. They are two footballing giants, and when he retires, Messi will be remembered," Ayala told FOX Sports.
"I don't know if it'll be like Diego, it doesn't matter. They are different. Diego was pure art in all his mannerisms, Messi a Speedy Gonzales who carries the ball two centimetres from his foot."
Messi's failure to win a senior international title with Argentina often counts against him when he is compared to Maradona, who spearheaded the country's success at the 1986 World Cup.
Barcelona star Messi has suffered defeat in four finals – three at the Copa America and the 2014 World Cup – but Ayala is confident he can be successful with Argentina.
Ayala has been impressed by the six-time Ballon d'Or winner's humility in the national team set-up.
"I hope that he gives us his footballing level, that he makes us grow as a team. Having a team with him, not of him," said Ayala.
"He wants to be treated like this, like just one more. We told the players, 'He will not be treated differently by us. You all have to step up, do what you do for your clubs, and he will help you. You have to take advantage of that.'"

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus wrap: Beaumont re-elected but European Road Championships cancelled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir Bill Beaumont insisted he had no time to celebrate his re-election as World Rugby chairman as he looks to guide to the sport through the coronavirus crisis.
Beaumont, who won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Agustin Pichot, said he wanted to see international rugby return as soon as possible.
“We have work to do,” the 68-year-old said. “We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
“I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future.”
Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster says he is in the dark over Rangers’ claims they have “alarming” evidence regarding the vote which saw the Scottish league season terminated, with the Glasgow giants so far refusing to hand over any proof.
Rangers want to see Doncaster suspended after accusing the SPFL of “bullying” clubs into voting for the plan to end the three lower divisions and possibly the Premiership.
“It has been several weeks and we’ve had absolutely no idea what it was that we were supposed to have done wrong,” Doncaster told BBC Sportsound.
“We’ve had all sorts of rumour and innuendo, vague allegations but nothing specific. It’s not even a question of evidence. We don’t even know what the charges are.
“I’m hearing that this alleged dossier of evidence is due to be circulated this week. We look forward to seeing what’s in it because the sooner we can get this dealt with and move on the better.”
Cycling’s European Road Championships will not take place this year due to the pandemic, the European Cycling Union has said.
The event was due to take place from September 9-13 this year, dates that clash with the rescheduled Tour de France. Trentino, which had the hosting rights, will instead stage the event in 2021.
Cycling’s world governing body the UCI intends to issue a revised schedule for the 2020 road season on Tuesday.
The UEC said it would work with the UCI and national federations “to look at the various alternatives for the 2020 European Road Championships and UEC calendar events this season so that all titles in each category can be awarded in all disciplines”.
In cricket, World Cup winner Jason Roy believes all players should be free to make their own decisions when the action resumes.
The start of the season has been pushed back until July 1 at the earliest and the England and Wales Cricket Board is plotting how matches could be staged as and when it gets a governmental green light to proceed, including the possibility of action behind closed doors in ‘bio-secure’ environments.
“If an individual wants to go on to the front line and put himself at risk,then good on him. But if somebody doesn’t want to, then I don’t think theyshould be criticised.”
Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph has reported that England could begin their three-Test series against the West Indies on July 8 with an ECB spokesman confirming “discussions with Cricket West Indies continued on Friday”.
Olympic rower Polly Swann has joined the fight against coronavirus as a junior doctor as she continues to train for the postponed Games in Tokyo.
“A lot of junior doctors have been moved to the most critical parts of the NHS, so interim foundation year doctors are backfilling their roles,” Dr Swann said.
“I’m definitely not a frontline ICU worker, but I’m glad I can still help to ease the burden in some way.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus wrap: Beaumont re-elected but European Road Championships cancelled</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir Bill Beaumont insisted he had no time to celebrate his re-election as World Rugby chairman as he looks to guide to the sport through the coronavirus crisis.
Beaumont, who won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Agustin Pichot, said he wanted to see international rugby return as soon as possible.
“We have work to do,” the 68-year-old said. “We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
“I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future.”
Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster says he is in the dark over Rangers’ claims they have “alarming” evidence regarding the vote which saw the Scottish league season terminated, with the Glasgow giants so far refusing to hand over any proof.
Rangers want to see Doncaster suspended after accusing the SPFL of “bullying” clubs into voting for the plan to end the three lower divisions and possibly the Premiership.
“It has been several weeks and we’ve had absolutely no idea what it was that we were supposed to have done wrong,” Doncaster told BBC Sportsound.
“We’ve had all sorts of rumour and innuendo, vague allegations but nothing specific. It’s not even a question of evidence. We don’t even know what the charges are.
“I’m hearing that this alleged dossier of evidence is due to be circulated this week. We look forward to seeing what’s in it because the sooner we can get this dealt with and move on the better.”
Cycling’s European Road Championships will not take place this year due to the pandemic, the European Cycling Union has said.
The event was due to take place from September 9-13 this year, dates that clash with the rescheduled Tour de France. Trentino, which had the hosting rights, will instead stage the event in 2021.
Cycling’s world governing body the UCI intends to issue a revised schedule for the 2020 road season on Tuesday.
The UEC said it would work with the UCI and national federations “to look at the various alternatives for the 2020 European Road Championships and UEC calendar events this season so that all titles in each category can be awarded in all disciplines”.
In cricket, World Cup winner Jason Roy believes all players should be free to make their own decisions when the action resumes.
The start of the season has been pushed back until July 1 at the earliest and the England and Wales Cricket Board is plotting how matches could be staged as and when it gets a governmental green light to proceed, including the possibility of action behind closed doors in ‘bio-secure’ environments.
Roy said: “`I don’t think I’ll have too many questions, especially when it got to the stage of ‘right, we’re going to play’ because there’ll be a lot of people inthose meetings discussing whether it’s the right thing to do or not.
“If an individual wants to go on to the front line and put himself at risk,then good on him. But if somebody doesn’t want to, then I don’t think theyshould be criticised.”
Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph has reported that England could begin their three-Test series against the West Indies on July 8 with an ECB spokesman confirming “discussions with Cricket West Indies continued on Friday”.
Olympic rower Polly Swann has joined the fight against coronavirus as a junior doctor as she continues to train for the postponed Games in Tokyo.
Swann, who took silver in the women’s eight in Rio four years ago, previously completed her medical degree and the 31-year-old has now joined the NHS to help the fight.
“A lot of junior doctors have been moved to the most critical parts of the NHS, so interim foundation year doctors are backfilling their roles,” Dr Swann said.
“I’m definitely not a frontline ICU worker, but I’m glad I can still help to ease the burden in some way.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beaumont re-elected World Rugby chief, calls for unity to tackle Covid-19 crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Englishman prevailed by a 28-23 margin to secure a second consecutive four-year term.
Frenchman Bernard Laporte, who was running unopposed, was elected vice-chairman.
"Now is not the time for celebration. We have work to do," Beaumont said in a statement.
"We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport."
Rugby, like most sports, has been on hold as the novel coronavirus spread across the world, casting doubt on whether the 2020 international calendar could be completed.
"I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future," Beaumont added.
Former England and British & Irish Lions lock Beaumont, 68, succeeded France's Bernard Lapasset in 2016.

The Spaniard’s contract was due to run out after this year’s European Championship, which was pushed back until 2021 due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Reports indicate Martinez, who took Belgium to third place at the 2018 World Cup, would double his current annual salary of 1.2 million euros ($1.33 million).
The former Everton, Wigan and Swansea manager replaced Marc Wilmots as Belgium boss in August 2016.
Belgium were drawn alongside Denmark, Finland, and Russia in Group B for Euro 2020. They qualified as Group I winners with a perfect record across 10 matches, scoring 40 goals and conceding just three in the process.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Share on FacebookShare on Twitter
Belgium coach Roberto Martinez has extended his contract through to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, ending weeks of speculation about a new deal, Belgian media reported on Saturday.
There was no official confirmation from the Belgian football association but newspapers said Martinez would stay in charge through to the next World Cup after negotiating a new two-year deal.
His contract was up after this year’s European Championship, which has been shifted back a year because of the coronavirus crisis.
Martinez, 46, had already said in interviews over the last weeks he wanted to stay in charge in order to take Belgium to Euro 2021, where they are drawn in Group B and will play Denmark, Finland and Russia.
The team, who are top of the FIFA world rankings, had qualified in imposing fashion, by winning all 10 qualifiers, scoring 40 goals and conceding just three.
Spanish-born Martinez, the former Wigan Athletic and Everton manager, took Belgium to third place at the World Cup and is popular among the players, reports added.
With much of Belgium’s 2018 World Cup squad set to be in their early 30’s or approaching retirement by the end of the 2022 tournament in Qatar.
The next two tournaments will be seen as crunch moments for a golden generation.
Eden Hazard will be 31-years-old and Kevin de Bruyne 30 after Qatar, and will be primed to lead Belgium to rival France’s reigning champions.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sir Bill Beaumont re-elected as World Rugby chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir Bill Beaumont has fought off competition from Agustin Pichot to be re-elected as the World Rugby chairman for a second term.
Beaumont won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Pichot, who will be replaced by Frenchman Bernard Laporte.
The 68-year-old will stay at the head of the governing body for the next four years, having started the role in 2016, and his primary task will be to lead the sport’s response to the Covid-19 crisis.
He said: “Over the last four years we have achieved a lot, but we are at half-time and need to press on in the second half. I now have a clear mandate to work with Bernard to implement progressive, sustainable change.
“As an organisation, we must lead, be transparent, accountable and continue to serve for all. We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible.
“We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.
“Now is not the time for celebration. We have work to do. We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
Pichot, who had worked alongside Beaumont for the last four years, had promised a radical new approach had he won the election, but fell just short in his quest to usurp Beaumont.
Beaumont added: “I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we aligned in many ways, and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant.”
President of the French Rugby Federation Laporte was voted into his position unopposed.
He said: “Congratulations to my friend Sir Bill Beaumont on his re-election.
“I would also like to express my best wishes to Agustin Pichot, a legend of Argentinian rugby and a great rugby leader.
“I also want to thank all unions who have expressed their opinion in this important ballot, giving a clear mandate for the governance which Bill and I will undertake on their behalf.”
Beaumont’s new four-year term will officially begin on May 12 when the results of the vote will be confirmed at World Rugby’s annual meeting of council.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Zealand calls for 'courage' from re-elected Beaumont</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SYDNEY: New Zealand Rugby has called on newly re-elected World Rugby Chairman Bill Beaumont to take the courageous decisions necessary to ensure that elite rugby is sustainable for more than just a few nations.
Former England captain Beaumont won a second four-year term as head of the sport's global governing body by beating Argentine Augustin Pichot 28-23 in a ballot of the World Rugby Council with the result announced on Saturday.
Pichot, calling for root-and-branch change in the game with an emphasis on helping out developing nations, had attracted the support of the southern hemisphere powers but failed to make any headway in Europe.
NZR Chairman Brent Impey congratulated Beaumont on his success but said the 68-year-old must recognise that the short election campaign had revealed a huge appetite for change.
"We are of course disappointed for Agustin Pichot as he had our vote, and it is important to us that whoever won the election will heed the calls for change to the game," he said in a statement.
"There is still a level of governance reform that is overdue, and it would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally – not just for a limited number of unions and regions."
Former Argentina scrumhalf Pichot, who has served as Beaumont's vice-chairman for the last four years, posted a short statement on Twitter.
"Congratulations Bill!" he wrote. "Not this time, thanks to all for the support from the bottom of my heart."
In his campaign manifesto, Beaumont had promised an independent review of World Rugby's governance and to spearhead the drive for a global calendar.
Critics will point to the make-up of the new Executive Committee, which was also elected in the ballot, as evidence of the need for change.
The 12-strong body included only three representatives from outside the game's traditional heartlands - a Tunisian and two Americans - with one of those the only woman.
Beaumont's first call after his re-election was for continued unity as the sport deals with impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought a stop to rugby around the world and caused major financial problems for unions big and small.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Zealand tell Beaumont: Rugby for all, not few</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former England captain Bill Beaumont was re-elected as World Rugby chairperson on Saturday and immediately came under pressure to have the "courage" to make the big decisions.
Beaumont beat ex-Argentina skipper Agustin Pichot to the top job, the governing body announced.
Beaumont, 68, who campaigned on the promise of opening up the sport, claimed 28 of the 51 votes to overcome the 45-year-old Pichot who planned to modernise the body and used the hashtag #GlobalGame on social media.

Once the round of congratulations had ended, New Zealand Rugby, who had backed Pichot, weighed in to remind Beaumont of his global responsibilities.
"Gus ran a strong campaign and gave his best effort in a highly principled manner and that is all that can be asked, so we are proud of him," said New Zealand Rugby chief Brent Impey.
"There is still a level of governance reform that is overdue, and it would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally - not just for a limited number of Unions and regions."
Beaumont said he was honoured to resume his role at the top of World Rugby.
"I would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support," said Beaumont in a statement released by World Rugby.
The announcement of the results was brought forward from the original date of 12 May due to the smoothness of the process.
Beaumont, who will have another four-year tenure, will be joined by the French Rugby Federation's chief Bernard Laporte as his vice-chairperson.
"Congratulations to my friend Sir Bill Beaumont on his re-election. I would also like to express my best wishes to Agustin Pichot, a legend of Argentinian rugby and a great rugby leader," said Laporte, who is set to oversee France hosting the 2023 World Cup.
"I also want to thank all unions who have expressed their opinion in this important ballot, giving a clear mandate for the governance which Bill and I will undertake on their behalf," he added.

The election process had been overshadowed by the resignation of Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) chairperson Francis Kean from the world body's council after accusations of "rampant homophobia".
Beaumont's bid was seconded by the Pacific Island union but World Rugby stressed the former lock's nomination came from the FRU, rather than from Kean.
Beaumont, who made 41 Test appearances for England as well as the British and Irish Lions before retiring in 1982, has overseen a $100 million relief package for the game during the coronavirus pandemic.
USA Rugby filed for bankruptcy in March and Rugby Australia said it was to lose around €69 million in revenue if the rest of their season was lost due to the outbreak.
"During this unprecedented and global Covid-19 crisis, we must act and unite unions from the north and south and the professional leagues around a common objective to define a strong and sustainable future for all," he said.
"We will pursue these reforms together and act in solidarity with the rugby family, to drive the game forward on and off the field, further the welfare of our players and make the sport more attractive and accessible."
Pichot, who retired from the sport 11 years ago and had been World Rugby vice-chairperson since 2016, hinted at trying for the main position again in the future.
"Not this time, thanks to all for the support, from the bottom of my heart. #globalgame," Pichot posted on Twitter on Saturday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Proof will be in the pudding': Beaumont narrowly wins second term</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Re-elected World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont is under pressure to deliver on his reform agenda after narrowly winning a second term at the global helm of the sport.
Beaumont beat former vice chairman-turned-rival Agustin Pichot by a 28-23 vote announced in Dublin overnight, with Japan and Rugby Africa believed to be among the decisive votes that pushed the result in the incumbent's favour.
French Federation president Bernard Laporte was elected unopposed to the vice-chairman's role, having run alongside Beaumont, and will formally take over from Pichot when the results are ratified at the annual World Rugby Council meeting on May 12.
Beaumont's win was a blow for the SANZAAR nations, all of which threw their support behind Pichot, the former Argentina Test halfback and president of the UAR after a Beaumont-led World Rugby failed to get the global Nations Championship tournament off the ground.
Pichot pitched himself as the more progressive candidate, pledging to re-launch the Nations Championship. Beaumont also added the competition to his platform after ruling out promotion and relegation, which caused it to fall over last year.
Former Wallabies flanker and Rugby Australia director Brett Robinson, who won a second term on the powerful World Rugby Executive Committee in the same elections, said it was up to Beaumont to prove his leadership partnership with Laporte could deliver globally.
"We have very good relationships with Bill and the northern countries. The frustration we've made clear to Bill over the past 12 to 18 months is the pace of change and the need to shift it faster than we were able to, from laws to competition models and other issues," Robinson said.
"This vote showed that a large proportion of the rugby world really is unhappy about what's happened. I think he acknowledges that and acknowledges the need for him to move faster and be open to change.
"We made our position clear to Bill on which way we were going and why, but equally we said that if we was successful we would be doing everything we could to help with his agenda and changing the game."
Robinson's position was echoed by Rugby Australia's interim executive chairman Paul McLean, and New Zealand Rugby chairman Brett Impey.
"We are disappointed for Gus Pichot, who had a strong and progressive vision for the game with an emphasis on global alignment and governance reform.
"With Rugby facing its greatest test in the current COVID-19 pandemic it is essential for the game to act in a unified way to deliver a sustainable future that ensures that all nations have the opportunity to grow and contribute to the ongoing success of the sport."
Impey said: "There is still a level of governance reform that is overdue, and it would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally — not just for a limited number of unions and regions."
Also included in Beaumont's and Laporte's campaign platform was another look at Regulation 8, which governs Test eligibility. Australia and New Zealand supported a recent push to allow tier one players whose Test careers were over to play Test rugby for a tier two nation for which they might also be eligible. The push failed, but Beaumont has promised to try again.
He has also promised a "wide-ranging governance review" to support a federation that "better serves the game, not one that is seen to only support the 'old guard'".
The pair have work to do to convince the southern hemisphere and other emerging nations that a World Rugby led by French and English power brokers will act in the interests of all of the game's members.
The French and English clubs were among the agitators against the Nations Championship last year, as well as the national unions of Scotland and Italy, who were worried about their capacity to stay in the top division of the proposed league.
Japan and Fiji would be the most likely nations to join the top division, a huge shift in the game's attitude towards the so-called tier two or 'emerging' countries. Beaumont promised to have the competition ready to go after the 2023 World Cup.
The organisation is likely to have more success with cementing a global calendar in the interim, helped, perversely, by the financial chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Northern hemisphere club competitions, where private ownership is widespread, are beginning to feel the pinch.
It was hard work getting the north to agree to moving the June Test window to July, which allowed Super Rugby to continue uninterrupted, but further reform to the Six Nations calendar is also on the table.
"I don't think anyone would agree that the cobbled-together structure of our international game makes sense," Robinson said.
"It's history from when we turned professional in 1995, 1996, that's dictating what it looks like and we have never stepped back and said 'what would be the ideal structure'.
"The flow-on effect of that is that the July and November windows were historical, but not sensible. It's how we get adjustment there that will be key."

    <h5 class="mb-1">'Proof will be in the pudding': Beaumont narrowly wins second term</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Re-elected World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont is under pressure to deliver on his reform agenda after narrowly winning a second term at the global helm of the sport.
Beaumont beat former vice chairman-turned-rival Agustin Pichot by a 28-23 vote announced in Dublin overnight, with Japan and Rugby Africa believed to be among the decisive votes that pushed the result in the incumbent's favour.
French Federation president Bernard Laporte was elected unopposed to the vice-chairman's role, having run alongside Beaumont, and will formally take over from Pichot when the results are ratified at the annual World Rugby Council meeting on May 12.
Beaumont's win was a blow for the SANZAAR nations, all of which threw their support behind Pichot, the former Argentina Test halfback and president of the UAR after a Beaumont-led World Rugby failed to get the global Nations Championship tournament off the ground.
Pichot pitched himself as the more progressive candidate, pledging to re-launch the Nations Championship. Beaumont also added the competition to his platform after ruling out promotion and relegation, which caused it to fall over last year.
Former Wallabies flanker and Rugby Australia director Brett Robinson, who won a second term on the powerful World Rugby Executive Committee in the same elections, said it was up to Beaumont to prove his leadership partnership with Laporte could deliver globally.
"We have very good relationships with Bill and the northern countries. The frustration we've made clear to Bill over the past 12 to 18 months is the pace of change and the need to shift it faster than we were able to, from laws to competition models and other issues," Robinson said.
"This vote showed that a large proportion of the rugby world really is unhappy about what's happened. I think he acknowledges that and acknowledges the need for him to move faster and be open to change.
"We made our position clear to Bill on which way we were going and why, but equally we said that if we was successful we would be doing everything we could to help with his agenda and changing the game."
Robinson's position was echoed by Rugby Australia's interim executive chairman Paul McLean, and New Zealand Rugby chairman Brett Impey.
"We are disappointed for Gus Pichot, who had a strong and progressive vision for the game with an emphasis on global alignment and governance reform.
"With Rugby facing its greatest test in the current COVID-19 pandemic it is essential for the game to act in a unified way to deliver a sustainable future that ensures that all nations have the opportunity to grow and contribute to the ongoing success of the sport."
Impey said: "There is still a level of governance reform that is overdue, and it would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally — not just for a limited number of unions and regions."
Also included in Beaumont's and Laporte's campaign platform was another look at Regulation 8, which governs Test eligibility. Australia and New Zealand supported a recent push to allow tier one players whose Test careers were over to play Test rugby for a tier two nation for which they might also be eligible. The push failed, but Beaumont has promised to try again.
He has also promised a "wide-ranging governance review" to support a federation that "better serves the game, not one that is seen to only support the 'old guard'".
The pair have work to do to convince the southern hemisphere and other emerging nations that a World Rugby led by French and English power brokers will act in the interests of all of the game's members.
The French and English clubs were among the agitators against the Nations Championship last year, as well as the national unions of Scotland and Italy, who were worried about their capacity to stay in the top division of the proposed league.
Japan and Fiji would be the most likely nations to join the top division, a huge shift in the game's attitude towards the so-called tier two or 'emerging' countries. Beaumont promised to have the competition ready to go after the 2023 World Cup.

    <h5 class="mb-1">The impact of Bill Beaumont's election on Australia's bid for Rugby World Cup 2027</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Insiders are confident that Bill Beaumont’s re-election as chairman of World Rugby will not hinder Australia’s chances of hosting the 2027 World Cup nor cash-strapped RA’s hopes of securing a multi-million-dollar payout from the governing body.

Like New Zealand, RA had backed Beaumont’s challenger for the role, Augustin Pichot, but the former Argentina captain lost out 28-23 to the Englishman in a ballot of the World Rugby Council.
While French Rugby Federation president Bernard Laporte was voted unopposed into Pichot’s former position as vice-chairman and Beaumont will be in charge for another four years, Australia retains a strong presence at the table with Brett Robinson re-elected to the seven-man board and Brett Gosper remaining as World Rugby’s chief executive officer.
A red card in the final moments of BBC’s crucial traditional match against Nudgee puts the defence under immense pressure, while the next generation of rugby players gain inspiration from the school’s Year 12’s
Although it will be disappointed that Pichot was not elected, it is understood RA has a healthy enough relationship with 68-year-old former England captain Beaumont to not be adversely impacted by his re-appointment.
After standing down 75 percent of its staff last month and cutting Australian Super Rugby players’ wages by an average of 60 percent, it was speculated that RA had been seeking $15 million of assistance from World Rugby.
There were reports that the huge financial injection would not be a loan but rather an advance payment of their share of the 2023 Rugby World Cup profits.
Rugby Australia has yet to comment on Beaumont’s re-election but New Zealand Rugby – who had thrown their support behind Pichot, who had pledged to undertake a root-and-branch review of the game with an emphasis on helping out developing nations – offered support but said Beaumont must recognise that the election campaign had revealed an appetite for change.

“We are of course disappointed for Agustin Pichot as he had our vote, and it is important to us that whoever won the election will heed the calls for change to the game,” NZR Chairman Brent Impey said in a statement.
“There is still a level of governance reform that is overdue, and it would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally – not just for a limited number of unions and regions.”
Critics will point to the make-up of the new Executive Committee, which was also elected in the ballot, as evidence of the need for change.
The 12-strong body includes only three representatives from outside the game’s traditional heartlands – a Tunisian and two Americans – with one of those, US Olympian Angela Ruggiero, the only woman.

Beaumont’s new four-year term will officially begin on May 12 when the results of the vote will be confirmed at World Rugby’s annual meeting of council.

    <h5 class="mb-1">New Zealand Rugby calls for 'courage' from re-elected Bill Beaumont</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SYDNEY: New Zealand Rugby has called on newly re-elected World Rugby Chairman Bill Beaumont to take the courageous decisions necessary to ensure that elite rugby is sustainable for more than just a few nations.
Former England captain Beaumont won a second four-year term as head of the sport's global governing body by beating Argentine Augustin Pichot 28-23 in a ballot of the World Rugby Council with the result announced on Saturday.
Pichot, calling for root-and-branch change in the game with an emphasis on helping out developing nations, had attracted the support of the southern hemisphere powers but failed to make any headway in Europe.
NZR Chairman Brent Impey congratulated Beaumont on his success but said the 68-year-old must recognise that the short election campaign had revealed a huge appetite for change.

"We are of course disappointed for Agustin Pichot as he had our vote, and it is important to us that whoever won the election will heed the calls for change to the game," he said in a statement.
"There is still a level of governance reform that is overdue, and it would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally – not just for a limited number of unions and regions."
Former Argentina scrumhalf Pichot, who has served as Beaumont's vice-chairman for the last four years, posted a short statement on Twitter.
"Congratulations Bill!" he wrote. "Not this time, thanks to all for the support from the bottom of my heart."
In his campaign manifesto, Beaumont had promised an independent review of World Rugby's governance and to spearhead the drive for a global calendar.
Critics will point to the make-up of the new Executive Committee, which was also elected in the ballot, as evidence of the need for change.
The 12-strong body included only three representatives from outside the game's traditional heartlands - a Tunisian and two Americans - with one of those the only woman.
Beaumont's first call after his re-election was for continued unity as the sport deals with impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has brought a stop to rugby around the world and caused major financial problems for unions big and small.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bill Beaumont reelected as World Rugby chairman in close vote</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York – Former England captain Bill Beaumont will lead World Rugby for another four years after being reelected on Saturday, beating Agustin Pichot with a first-round majority.
The sport’s governing body said the 68-year-old Beaumont won by 28 votes to 23 against Pichot, the former Argentina scrumhalf who served as Beaumont's vice chairman since 2016.
Beaumont says he plans a progressive reform of governance, with an integrated approach to the global calendar; the prioritization of player welfare; an accelerated promotion of the women’s game; and giving smaller nations more matches against big nations.
"I am honored to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s chairman once again," Beaumont said. "I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we were aligned in many ways and I have the utmost respect for him.”
French rugby federation president Bernard Laporte — the former France coach — becomes Beaumont’s new vice chairman after running unopposed.
Laporte considers it important to unite the northern and southern hemispheres and all professional leagues "around a common objective to define a strong and lasting future.”
Beaumont begins his second term after a council meeting on May 12 and pledged to "serve for all” in the wider interests of rugby.
"We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible," he said. "We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.”
Beaumont was a formidable lock as a player and captained England to the then-Five Nations Grand Slam title in 1980. He has proved a popular chairman with the game’s established powers.
"Bill is ideally placed to lead and unite rugby unions in strengthening the game so we can address the immediate and longer term challenges," Bill Sweeney, chief executive of England's Rugby Football Union, said of Beaumont's victory.
The 45-year-old Pichot was looking to become the first chairman from outside the Six Nations unions or leading southern hemisphere nations. He wanted to give the less-established rugby nations a bigger say at boardroom level, take the game to a younger audience and revive the Nations League proposal abandoned less than a year ago.
He was favored by the sport’s less-wealthy nations, his appeal perhaps heightened by weighty financial concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic. Beaumont's thoughts turned immediately to helping rugby through a huge financial crisis following the pandemic outbreak.
In recent weeks he has overseen a $100 million relief package for the game. USA Rugby filed for bankruptcy in March and Rugby Australia said it was to lose around €69 million ($76.5 million) in revenue if the rest of its season was lost due to the outbreak.
"(We) must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritizes player welfare, while optimizing any opportunity to return to international rugby this year," Beaumont said. "I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterized our work so far in response to an unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach.”
Once the round of congratulations had ended, New Zealand Rugby, who had backed Pichot, weighed in to remind Beaumont of his global responsibilities.
"Gus ran a strong campaign and gave his best effort in a highly principled manner and that is all that can be asked, so we are proud of him," said New Zealand Rugby chief Brent Impey.
"There is still a level of governance reform that is overdue, and it would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally — not just for a limited number of Unions and regions."
Beaumont had a solid first term as chairman, with last year’s World Cup in Japan a huge success financially and in terms of attracting new fans. Japan embraced the tournament fully, making it one of the most festive and popular rugby has enjoyed.
"During this unprecedented and global COVID-19 crisis, we must act and unite unions from the north and south and the professional leagues around a common objective to define a strong and sustainable future for all," Beaumont said.
"We will pursue these reforms together and act in solidarity with the rugby family, to drive the game forward on and off the field, further the welfare of our players and make the sport more attractive and accessible."
Beaumont's nomination had been seconded by the Fiji Rugby Union, whose chairman Francis Kean was forced out of the World Rugby council following allegations of discriminatory conduct.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beaumont pips Pichot to World Rugby chairman post</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS - Former England captain Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as World Rugby chairman beating ex-Argentina skipper Agustin Pichot, the governing body announced on Saturday.
Beaumont, 68, who campaigned on the promise of opening up the sport, claimed 28 of the 51 votes to overcome the 45-year-old Pichot who planned to modernise the body and used the hashtag #GlobalGame on social media.
"I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation's Chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support," said Beaumont in a statement released by World Rugby.
The announcement of the results was brought forward from the original date of May 12 due to the smoothness of the voting process.
"Not this time, thanks to all for the support, from the bottom of my heart. #globalgame," Pichot posted on Twitter on Saturday.
Beaumont, who will have another four-year tenure, will be joined by the French Rugby Federation's chief Bernard Laporte as his vice-chairman.
The election process had been overshadowed by the resignation of Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) chairman Francis Kean from the world body's council after accusations of "rampant homophobia".
Beaumont's bid was seconded by the Pacific Island union but World Rugby stressed the former lock's nomination came from the FRU, rather than from Kean.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Northern alliance: Beaumont re-elected as World Rugby chief</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir Bill Beaumont has fought off competition from Agustin Pichot to be re- elected as the World Rugby chairman for a second term.
Beaumont won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Pichot, who will be replaced by Frenchman Bernard Laporte.
The 68-year-old former England captain will stay at the head of the governing body for the next four years, having started the role in 2016, and his primary task will be to lead the sport's response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Beaumont won the vote on the strength of the backing from northern hemisphere allies, given the southern hemisphere nations had thrown their support behind Pichot.
He said: "Over the last four years we have achieved a lot, but we are at half- time and need to press on in the second half. I now have a clear mandate to work with Bernard to implement progressive, sustainable change.
"As an organisation, we must lead, be transparent, accountable and continue to serve for all. We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible.
"We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.
"Now is not the time for celebration. We have work to do.

Beaumont added: "I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we aligned in many ways, and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant."
President of the French Rugby Federation Laporte was voted into his position unopposed.
Beaumont's new four-year term will officially begin on May 12 when the results of the vote will be confirmed at World Rugby's annual meeting of council.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Northern alliance: Beaumont re-elected as World Rugby chief</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sir Bill Beaumont has fought off competition from Agustin Pichot to be re- elected as the World Rugby chairman for a second term.
Beaumont won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Pichot, who will be replaced by Frenchman Bernard Laporte.
The 68-year-old former England captain will stay at the head of the governing body for the next four years, having started the role in 2016, and his primary task will be to lead the sport's response to the COVID-19 crisis.
Beaumont won the vote on the strength of the backing from northern hemisphere allies, given the southern hemisphere nations had thrown their support behind Pichot.
He said: "Over the last four years we have achieved a lot, but we are at half- time and need to press on in the second half. I now have a clear mandate to work with Bernard to implement progressive, sustainable change.
"As an organisation, we must lead, be transparent, accountable and continue to serve for all. We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible.
"We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beaumont re-elected as World Rugby chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON — Former England captain Bill Beaumont will lead World Rugby for another four years after being re-elected on Saturday, beating Agustín Pichot with a first-round majority.
The sport’s governing body said the 68-year-old Beaumont won by 28 votes to 23 against Pichot, the former Argentina scrumhalf who served as Beaumont's vice chairman since 2016.
Beaumont says he plans a progressive reform of governance, with an integrated approach to the global calendar; the prioritization of player welfare; an accelerated promotion of the women’s game; and giving smaller nations more matches against big nations.
“I am honored to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s chairman once again," Beaumont said. "I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we were aligned in many ways and I have the utmost respect for him.”
French rugby federation president Bernard Laporte — the former France coach — becomes Beaumont’s new vice chairman after running unopposed.
Beaumont begins his second term after a council meeting on May 12 and pledged to “serve for all” in the wider interests of rugby.
“We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible," he said. “We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.”
Beaumont was a formidable lock as a player and captained England to the then-Five Nations Grand Slam title in 1980. He has proved a popular chairman with the game’s established powers.
The 45-year-old Pichot was looking to become the first chairman from outside the Six Nations unions or leading southern hemisphere nations. He wanted to give the less-established rugby nations a bigger say at boardroom level, take the game to a younger audience and revive the Nations League proposal abandoned less than a year ago.
He was favored by the sport’s less wealthy nations, his appeal perhaps heightened by weighty financial concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic. Beaumont's thoughts turned immediately to helping rugby through a huge financial crisis following the pandemic outbreak.
“(We) must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritizes player welfare, while optimizing any opportunity to return to international rugby this year," Beaumont said. “I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterized our work so far in response to an unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach.”
Laporte considers it important to unite the northern and southern hemispheres and all professional leagues “around a common objective to define a strong and lasting future.”
Beaumont had a solid first term as chairman, with last year’s World Cup in Japan a huge success financially and in terms of attracting new fans. Japan embraced the tournament fully, making it one of the most festive and popular rugby has enjoyed.
His nomination had been seconded by the Fiji Rugby Union, whose chairman Francis Kean was forced out of the World Rugby council following allegations of discriminatory conduct.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sir Bill Beaumont re-elected as the chairman of World Rugby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former England captain Sir Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as the chairman of World Rugby.
The 68-year-old fought off a challenge from his vice-chairman Agustin Pichot and will stay at the head of the governing body for the next four years.
Beaumont won with a slim 28-23 majority of the votes, World Rugby announced, while Bernard Laporte - the French Rugby Federation President - was voted in as the new vice-chairman.
Beaumont said: "I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation's chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support."
Rugby, like most sports, has been on hold as the coronavirus pandemic spread across the world, and it has cast doubt on whether the 2020 international calendar will be completed.
"Now is not the time for celebration," said Beaumont. "We have work to do.
"We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
"I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future."
Former England and British & Irish Lions lock Beaumont, 68, succeeded France's Bernard Lapasset in 2016.
Pichot, who had worked alongside Beaumont for the last four years, had promised a radical new approach had he won the election, but fell just short.
Beaumont added: "I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years.
"While we stood against each other in this campaign, we aligned in many ways, and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant."
RFU CEO Bill Sweeney said: "On behalf of everyone at the RFU, I would like to congratulate Bill on his re-election.
"Bill is ideally placed to lead and unite rugby unions in strengthening the game, so we can address the immediate and longer term challenges."
President of the French Rugby Federation Laporte was voted into his position unopposed.
He said: "Congratulations to my friend Sir Bill Beaumont on his re-election.
"I would also like to express my best wishes to Agustin Pichot, a legend of Argentinian rugby and a great rugby leader.
"I also want to thank all unions who have expressed their opinion in this important ballot, giving a clear mandate for the governance which Bill and I will undertake on their behalf."
Beaumont's new four-year term will officially begin on May 12 when the results of the vote will be confirmed at World Rugby's annual meeting of council.

Beaumont, 68, who campaigned on the promise of opening up the sport, claimed 28 of the 51 votes to overcome the 45-year-old Pichot who planned to modernise the body and used the hashtag #GlobalGame on social media.
"I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation's chairperson once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support," said Beaumont in a statement released by World Rugby.
The announcement of the results was brought forward from the original date of May 12 due to the smoothness of the voting process.
Beaumont, who will have another four-year tenure, will be joined by the French Rugby Federation's chief Bernard Laporte as his vice-chairperson.
"Congratulations to my friend Sir Bill Beaumont on his re-election. I would also like to express my best wishes to Agustin Pichot, a legend of Argentinian rugby and a great rugby leader," said Laporte, who is set to oversee France hosting the 2023 Rugby World Cup.
"I also want to thank all unions who have expressed their opinion in this important ballot, giving a clear mandate for the governance which Bill and I will undertake on their behalf," he added.
The election process had been overshadowed by the resignation of Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) chairperson Francis Kean from the world body's council after accusations of "rampant homophobia".
Beaumont's bid was seconded by the Pacific Island union but World Rugby stressed the former lock's nomination came from the FRU, rather than from Kean.
Beaumont, who made 41 Test appearances for England as well as the British and Irish Lions before retiring in 1982, has overseen a $100 million relief package for the game during the coronavirus pandemic.
USA Rugby filed for bankruptcy in March and Rugby Australia said it was to lose Au$120 million in revenue if the rest of their season was lost due to the outbreak.
"During this unprecedented and global Covid-19 crisis, we must act and unite unions from the north and south and the professional leagues around a common objective to define a strong and sustainable future for all," he said. 
"We will pursue these reforms together and act in solidarity with the rugby family, to drive the game forward on and off the field, further the welfare of our players and make the sport more attractive and accessible."
Pichot, who retired from the sport 11 years ago and had been World Rugby vice-chairperson since 2016, hinted at trying for the main position again in the future.
"Not this time, thanks to all for the support, from the bottom of my heart. #globalgame," Pichot posted on Twitter on Saturday.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS
Former England captain Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as World Rugby chairman beating ex-Argentina skipper Agustin Pichot, the governing body announced on Saturday.
Beaumont, 68, who campaigned on the promise of opening up the sport, claimed 28 of the 51 votes to overcome the 45-year-old Pichot who planned to modernise the body and used the hashtag #GlobalGame on social media.
"I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation's chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support," said Beaumont in a statement released by World Rugby.
The announcement of the results was brought forward from the original date of May 12 due to the smoothness of the process.
Beaumont, who will have another four-year tenure, will be joined by the French Rugby Federation's chief Bernard Laporte as his vice-chairman.
"Congratulations to my friend Sir Bill Beaumont on his re-election. I would also like to express my best wishes to Agustin Pichot, a legend of Argentinian rugby and a great rugby leader," said Laporte, who is set to oversee France hosting the 2023 Rugby World Cup.
"I also want to thank all unions who have expressed their opinion in this important ballot, giving a clear mandate for the governance which Bill and I will undertake on their behalf," he added.
The election process had been overshadowed by the resignation of Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) chairman Francis Kean from the world body's council after accusations of "rampant homophobia".
Beaumont's bid was seconded by the Pacific Island union but World Rugby stressed the former lock's nomination came from the FRU, rather than from Kean.
Beaumont, who made 41 Test appearances for England as well as the British and Irish Lions before retiring in 1982, has overseen a $100 million (90.8 million euros) relief package for the game during the coronavirus pandemic.
USA Rugby filed for bankruptcy in March and Rugby Australia said it was to lose around 69 million euros in revenue if the rest of their season was lost due to the outbreak.
"During this unprecedented and global Covid-19 crisis, we must act and unite unions from the north and south and the professional leagues around a common objective to define a strong and sustainable future for all," he said.
"We will pursue these reforms together and act in solidarity with the rugby family, to drive the game forward on and off the field, further the welfare of our players and make the sport more attractive and accessible."
Pichot, who retired from the sport 11 years ago and had been World Rugby vice-chairman since 2016, hinted at trying for the main position again in the future.
"Not this time, thanks to all for the support, from the bottom of my heart. #globalgame," Pichot posted on Twitter on Saturday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Beaumont re-elected as World Rugby chairman, beats Pichot</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former England captain Bill Beaumont will lead World Rugby for another four years after being re-elected on Saturday, beating Agustín Pichot with a first-round majority.
The sport’s governing body said the 68-year-old Beaumont won by 28 votes to 23 against Pichot, the former Argentina scrumhalf who served as Beaumont's vice chairman since 2016.
Canada was one of the nations that voted in support of Beaumont.
Beaumont says he plans a progressive reform of governance, with an integrated approach to the global calendar; the prioritization of player welfare; an accelerated promotion of the women’s game; and giving smaller nations more matches against big nations.
“I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s chairman once again," Beaumont said. "I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we were aligned in many ways and I have the utmost respect for him.”
French rugby federation president Bernard Laporte — the former France coach — becomes Beaumont’s new vice chairman after running unopposed.
Beaumont begins his second term after a council meeting on May 12 and pledged to “serve for all” in the wider interests of rugby.
“We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible," he said. “We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.”
Beaumont was a formidable lock as a player and captained England to the then-Five Nations Grand Slam title in 1980. He has proved a popular chairman with the game’s established powers.
The 45-year-old Pichot was looking to become the first chairman from outside the Six Nations unions or leading southern hemisphere nations. He wanted to give the less-established rugby nations a bigger say at boardroom level, take the game to a younger audience and revive the Nations League proposal abandoned less than a year ago.
He was favoured by the sport’s less wealthy nations, his appeal perhaps heightened by weighty financial concerns amid the coronavirus pandemic. Beaumont's thoughts turned immediately to helping rugby through a huge financial crisis following the pandemic outbreak.
“(We) must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritizes player welfare, while optimizing any opportunity to return to international rugby this year," Beaumont said. “I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterized our work so far in response to an unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach.”
Laporte considers it important to unite the northern and southern hemispheres and all professional leagues “around a common objective to define a strong and lasting future.”
Beaumont had a solid first term as chairman, with last year’s World Cup in Japan a huge success financially and in terms of attracting new fans. Japan embraced the tournament fully, making it one of the most festive and popular rugby has enjoyed.
His nomination had been seconded by the Fiji Rugby Union, whose chairman Francis Kean was forced out of the World Rugby council following allegations of discriminatory conduct.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bill Beaumont Wins World Rugby Election Over Agustin Pichot</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bill Beaumont will serve another four years as chairman of World Rugby after winning the election against challenger Agustin Pichot.
Pichot was always going to be up against it due to the Six Nations countries’ preference for the former England captain.
However, the discontent in the game which has been heightened due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic suggested that Pichot could have been within a chance of winning.
Although Pichot didn’t win, it was a lot closer than one would have expected this time last year and Beaumont will know that there is a strong call for change in how the game is governed as he enters his second four-year term.
There were 51 votes available and Beaumont won out on a final tally of 28-23.
It is believed that all of the SANZAAR unions voted in favour of Pichot while the Six Nations unions voted in favour of Beaumont.
It is understood that the former Argentine international needed to get the backing from the likes of Fiji and Samoa but failed to do so.
Elsewhere, Fédération Française de Rugby President Bernard Laporte was elected the new Vice-Chairman.
An integrated approach to the global international calendar, accelerated prioritisation of player welfare, injury-prevention and modified contact variants, accelerated promotion of the women’s game and sustainable investment the sport are the targets which Beaumont hopes to achieve over the next four years.
“I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s Chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support and trust,” Beaumont said.
“I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we were aligned in many ways and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant.”
The new Executive Committee will comprise: Sir Bill Beaumont (Chairman), Bernard Laporte (Vice-Chairman, Fédération Française de Rugby), Brett Gosper (Chief Executive), Angela Ruggiero (Independent), Lord Mervyn Davies (Independent); Mark Alexander (South African Rugby Union), Khaled Babbou (Rugby Africa), Bart Campbell (New Zealand Rugby), Gareth Davies (Welsh Rugby Union), John Jeffrey (Scottish Rugby), Bob Latham (USA Rugby) and Brett Robinson (Rugby Australia).

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bill Beaumont fights off Agustin Pichot to win re-election as World Rugby chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bill Beaumont has secured a second term as chairman of World Rugby, the game's governing body.
The 68-year-old former England captain fought off competition from his former right-hand man Agustin Pichot, who was promising a more radical approach to governing the game.
However, the over-arching view is that now is not the time for sweeping changes throughout the game as it faces up to a myriad of serious challenges arising from the coronavirus pandemic.
Beaumont, who will now serve four more years, won the race vote 28-23. Frenchman Bernard Laporte will be his vice-chairman.
"I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s Chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support and trust," said Beaumont."I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we were aligned in many ways and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant."
Earlier this week, the Welsh Rugby Union confirmed that they had backed Beaumont for another term, despite being one of the only Six Nations Unions to bother responding to Pichot's proposals.
On Wednesday, WRU chairman Gareth Davies, who will once again sit on World Rugby's executive committee, said: "As always, it is vitally important to us that due and proper process is followed in the governance of our game in Wales and I would like to formally confirm to our members clubs the Board’s conclusion to support Bill Beaumont in his bid to be re-elected for a further term.
"We have spoken to both candidates and assessed their manifesto commitments in turn. We have digested the dynamic drive for change presented by Agustin and understood the commitment to progress but also stability and the steady hand provided by Bill.
"Some members of our Board expressed direct support for Bill and others acceded to take their steer from those of us who are closest to the issues at play.
"There were members of both our exec board and the PRB who expressed a preference for Agustin, and this was by no means a ‘one horse race’ in the Board’s eyes, but our final collective decision was reached based on evidence provided, due diligence and research of each candidate."
Beaumont's attention must now turn to the sport's fight to survive the coronavirus pandemic.
Unions all over the world and their domestic professional teams are facing an unprecedented financial crisis brought on by Covid-19.
Many have had to take drastic measures including furloughing of staff and significant pay cuts in a bid to still be in existence when the virus abates.

"Now is not the time for celebration," added Beaumont. "We have work to do. We are tackling COVID-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
"I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work so far in response to an unprecedented global COVID-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bill Beaumont re-elected as chairman of World Rugby</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as World Rugby’s chairman for another four years after overcoming Agustín Pichot in a closely fought election. The former England captain won a margin of five votes, defeating the Argentinian by 28 to 23.
Beaumont, who was first elected chairman in 2016, was the favourite for victory but Pichot, formerly his vice-chairman, mounted a late challenge and gathered considerable momentum. Sources close to Pichot believed the vote was as close as 24-23 in Beaumont’s favour with Japan and Rugby Africa yet to declare their intentions, but both have backed the incumbent.
Beaumont, 68, was considered the safe choice against the revolutionary Pichot, who had pledged wide scale reform. Pichot had the backing of the Sanzaar nations, who were disgruntled that the proposed Nations Championship failed to materialise last year, while Beaumont was backed by the Six Nations, whose votes amounted to 18 in a weighted electoral system. Thanks to additional support from Rugby Europe, Canada, Samoa, Fiji and the split North American vote, Beaumont has clinched victory.
There had been fears from within Beaumont’s camp that the controversy surrounding the key support of Fiji’s Francis Kean, a convicted killer who is facing fresh allegations of homophobia, would derail his bid. Beaumont, however, backed by his new vice-chairman, France’s Bernard Laporte, can now set about shaping rugby’s future in the post-pandemic world.
Voting in the election closed on Thursday but the result was initially not due to be announced until the World Rugby council meeting on May 12th. After a clear winner was determined without the need for a second round of voting, both candidates agreed for the result to be announced on Saturday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Bristol Rugby star Agustín Pichot narrowly misses out on World Rugby chairmanship</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Bristol Rugby star Agustín Pichot has narrowly missed out on becoming World Rugby chairman.
Pichot was standing against current incumbent Bill Beaumont, who won by five votes in a 28-23 outcome.
The Argentinian had been Beaumont's vice chairman that had gathered considerable momentum, but Japan and Rugby Africa's votes swung the campaign in former England captain Beaumont's favour.
Pichot, who made 65 appearances for Bristol in a four-year spell between 1999 and 2003, had pledged wide-scale reform if he had won the vote.
The scrum-half had the backing of South Africa, New Zealand, Australia and Argentina, who were upset over the fact the proposed Nations Championship had failed to materialise last year.
Yet Beaumont was backed by the Six Nations, whose votes counted for 18 due to a weighted electoral system.
Pichot has now been replaced as vice chairman by France's Bernard Laporte.
Beaumont said: “I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support.
“Now is not the time for celebration. We have work to do.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former England captain pips Pichot to World Rugby chairman post</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">FORMER ENGLAND captain Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as World Rugby chairman beating ex-Argentina skipper Agustin Pichot, the governing body announced on Saturday.
Beaumont, 68, who campaigned on the promise of opening up the sport, claimed 28 of the 51 votes to overcome the 45-year-old Pichot who planned to modernise the body and used the hashtag #GlobalGame on social media.
“I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation’s Chairman once again and would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support,” said Beaumont in a statement released by World Rugby.
The announcement of the results was brought forward from the original date of 12 May due to the smoothness of the voting process.
Beaumont, who will have another four-year tenure, will be joined by the French Rugby Federation’s chief Bernard Laporte as his vice-chairman.
“Congratulations to my friend Sir Bill Beaumont on his re-election. I would also like to express my best wishes to Agustin Pichot, a legend of Argentinian rugby and a great rugby leader,” said Laporte, who is set to oversee France hosting the 2023 Rugby World Cup.
“I also want to thank all unions who have expressed their opinion in this important ballot, giving a clear mandate for the governance which Bill and I will undertake on their behalf,” he added.
The election process had been overshadowed by the resignation of Fiji Rugby Union (FRU) chairman Francis Kean from the world body’s council after accusations of “rampant homophobia”.
Beaumont’s bid was seconded by the Pacific Island union but World Rugby stressed the former lock’s nomination came from the FRU, rather than from Kean.
- ‘Sustainable future’ -
Beaumont, who made 41 Test appearances for England as well as the British and Irish Lions before retiring in 1982, has overseen a $100 million (€90.8 million) relief package for the game during the coronavirus pandemic.
USA Rugby filed for bankruptcy in March and Rugby Australia said it was to lose Au$120 million in revenue if the rest of their season was lost due to the outbreak.
“During this unprecedented and global Covid-19 crisis, we must act and unite unions from the north and south and the professional leagues around a common objective to define a strong and sustainable future for all,” he said. 
“We will pursue these reforms together and act in solidarity with the rugby family, to drive the game forward on and off the field, further the welfare of our players and make the sport more attractive and accessible.”
Pichot, who retired from the sport 11 years ago and had been World Rugby vice-chairman since 2016, hinted at trying for the main position again in the future.
“Not this time, thanks to all for the support, from the bottom of my heart. #globalgame,” Pichot posted on Twitter on Saturday.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sir Bill Beaumont re-elected as World Rugby chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The 68-year-old won a slim majority to beat Agustin Pichot to the role.
Sir Bill Beaumont has fought off competition from Agustin Pichot to be re-elected as the World Rugby chairman for a second term.
Beaumont won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Pichot, who will be replaced by Frenchman Bernard Laporte.
The 68-year-old will stay at the head of the governing body for the next four years, having started the role in 2016, and his primary task will be to lead the sport’s response to the Covid-19 crisis.
He said: “Over the last four years we have achieved a lot, but we are at half-time and need to press on in the second half. I now have a clear mandate to work with Bernard to implement progressive, sustainable change.
“As an organisation, we must lead, be transparent, accountable and continue to serve for all. We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible.
“We must listen to players, fans, competitions, our unions and regions, and take decisions that are in the best interests of all with our strong values to the fore.
“Now is not the time for celebration. We have work to do. We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
“I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game when we emerge with new enthusiasm, a renewed purpose and an exciting future.”
Pichot, who had worked alongside Beaumont for the last four years, had promised a radical new approach had he won the election, but fell just short in his quest to usurp Beaumont.
Beaumont added: “I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we aligned in many ways, and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant.”
President of the French Rugby Federation Laporte was voted into his position unopposed.
He said: “Congratulations to my friend Sir Bill Beaumont on his re-election.
“I would also like to express my best wishes to Agustin Pichot, a legend of Argentinian rugby and a great rugby leader.
“I also want to thank all unions who have expressed their opinion in this important ballot, giving a clear mandate for the governance which Bill and I will undertake on their behalf.”
Beaumont’s new four-year term will officially begin on May 12 when the results of the vote will be confirmed at World Rugby’s annual meeting of council.

    <h5 class="mb-1">World Rugby election: Sir Bill Beaumont beats Agustin Pichot and is re-elected chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former England captain Sir Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as the chairman of World Rugby for another four years.
The 68-year-old defeated his former deputy, ex-Argentina skipper Agustin Pichot, by 28 votes to 23.
French Rugby president Bernard Laporte has been elected vice-chairman.
"I am honoured to accept the mandate of the World Rugby Council to serve as the international federation's chairman once again," said Beaumont.
"I would like to thank my union and region colleagues, members of the global rugby family and, of course, my family for their full support.
"I would like to thank Gus for his friendship and support over the last four years. While we stood against each other in this campaign, we aligned in many ways, and I have the utmost respect for him. Gus is passionate about the sport and his contribution has been significant."
Beaumont was first elected president in July 2016, succeeding Bernard Lapasset.
His re-election will be confirmed at World Rugby's annual Council meeting on 12 May, after which his new term in charge will begin.
He added: "Over the last four years we have achieved a lot, but we are at half-time and need to press on in the second half. I now have a clear mandate to work with Bernard [Laporte] to implement progressive, sustainable change.
"As an organisation, we must lead, be transparent, accountable and continue to serve for all. We must be united in our drive to make this great sport even better, simpler, safer and more accessible.
"Now is not the time for celebration. We are tackling Covid-19 and must implement an appropriate return-to-rugby strategy that prioritises player welfare, while optimising any opportunity to return to international rugby this year in full collaboration with club competitions for the good of players, fans and the overall financial health of the sport.
"I am determined to ensure that the spirit of unity and solidarity that has characterised our work in response to an unprecedented global Covid-19 pandemic, is the cornerstone of a new approach that will deliver a stronger, more sustainable game."
Bill Sweeney, chief executive of the RFU, congratulated Beaumont on his re-election.
"Bill is ideally placed to lead and unite rugby unions in strengthening the game so we can address the immediate and longer term challenges," he said.
Chris Jones, BBC Sport rugby union correspondent
Beaumont was always the favourite for re-election, and although Pichot ran a dynamic and passionate campaign, the former England captain won in the end with a little bit to spare.
But the hard work starts now for Beaumont, who has a lot on his plate in the short, medium, and long term. Guiding the sport through the turbulence of the current situation is the immediate priority, but throughout that process he has to convince stakeholders worldwide - unions and clubs on both sides of the equator - to support his vision for the game; without that backing and collaboration, he will achieve little.
His manifesto pledges a global sport open to all. He now has the mandate to try and lead rugby union into a new era between now and 2024.

    <h5 class="mb-1">England skipper Root involved in talks to reschedule Windies Test series</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England captain Joe Root and his West Indies counterpart Jason Holder have been involved in talks over rescheduling a three-Test series between the two sides later this summer in the UK.
The Daily Telegraph has reported that England could begin their three-Test series against the West Indies on July 8, with an ECB spokesman confirming discussions with Cricket West Indies continued this week.
"Positive ongoing discussions with the ECB and CWI continued on Friday," a spokesperson said.
"Both boards were represented including captains, coaches, administrators and the chief medical officers from the respective boards.
"Discussions were wide-ranging including dialogue around revised schedules and COVID-19 medical and biosecurity planning.
"Meetings will be ongoing over the next few months to reach an outcome of when international cricket could potentially return.
"This is a long and detailed process and is very much in the early stages of planning. The guidance from the Government will emphasise what we can do."
The ECB has suspended all professional cricket until July 1 due to the coronavirus pandemic, with growing doubts over the domestic season after the launch of new flagship tournament The Hundred was postponed until next summer.
England completed a tour of South Africa in mid-February before heading to Sri Lanka the following month, but that trip was curtailed midway through the match against the Sri Lanka Board President's XI as England headed home due to growing concerns over the pandemic.
The three-Test series against the West Indies was originally due to begin on June 4 at the Oval before Australia arrived for white-ball cricket in July.
Pakistan were then due to play three Tests against England in August.
The reported plan to start the series against the West Indies on July 8 would allow players to take part in a handful of warm-up matches assuming the current suspension is lifted at the start of July.
The series against Pakistan could then begin a few days later than planned on August 5, with the three ODIs and three T20 matches with Australia moved to September.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">This year's Evolution Championship Series, Evo 2020, which was to be held in Las Vegas from July 31 to August 2 later this year, has been cancelled in the wake of the ongoing global coronavirus outbreak. The announcement was made via the official Twitter page of the event.
As seen in the message from the organizers in the above tweet, the annual e-sports gaming event will be taking place online instead of the usual championship event held physically every year. Fortunately, those who have already purchased tickets for the gaming tournament will be refunded in full.
As of right now, not much information is available about the schedule and other details for the online Evo event. The only confirmed fact is that the online Evo 2020 championship will take place at an unknown date and time this summer, with promises to reveal further information soon.
The Evolution Championship Series is an e-sports tournament centered around fighting games and is one of the longest-running championships of its kind in the world. Hundreds of participants attend the event held annually in Las Vegas, Nevada, from different parts of the globe.

As Coronavirus has made a lot of events get postponed or cancelled, tech companies have witnessed huge losses due to the cancellation of these events. But now, tech companies have turned to U turn by going with virtual events. Yes, be it the gadget's launch or announcement of any release of their products, myriads of companies are approaching online for their needs.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Here, the PA news agency looks at the challenges which will be facing him.
An action plan needs to be drawn up – quickly. Leading unions are going to see massive drops in revenue of tens of millions of pounds. Tier two countries will also be seeking support. International rugby this summer is looking unlikely and a workable plan needs to be in place ahead of the November internationals. World Rugby is already looking at the finances of all tier one nations and has promised to help those in trouble. But the Test calendar, which generates the bulk of the sport's revenue, needs sorting. It seems a long time ago now, but the Six Nations has still to be completed.
A topic that is not going to go away, and one that is not just a burning issue for rugby union. The first issue to sort regarding safety is not even rugby-related – players and staff will need to be reassured that the necessary precautions are in place regarding Covid-19. Once that battle is won, attention will again turn to the long-term effects of playing rugby especially around concussion. World Rugby has launched a scheme called Activate – describing it as a "game-changer" –  following research co-led by England Rugby and the University of Bath. It is claimed the exercise programme can reduce the risk of soft-tissue injuries by 26 and 40 per cent and concussion risk by 29 and 60 per cent in youth and adult rugby players, respectively. But more still needs to be done in this field.
Allegations of unethical governance in the sport's unions have led to reports that rugby union could be blocked from the Olympics. There is also frustration by southern hemisphere countries and many tier two unions that the Six Nations unions are too dominant – currently tier one nations have three votes each in elections.  
Beaumont has been vociferous in his support for the women's game, speaking of the importance in his manifesto – as did Agustin Pichot. Although World Rugby has increased female representation on its Council, there are no women standing for a position on the executive committee. With drops in revenue expected for all sports due to the coronavirus pandemic, fears have been expressed that women's sport could suffer as a consequence and Beaumont will want to ensure that does not happen in rugby union.

    <h5 class="mb-1">What’s on the agenda for the re-elected Bill Beaumount?</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Bill Beaumont has been re-elected as the chairman of World Rugby.
The former England captain fought off competition from Agustin Pichot to be re-elected as chairman for a second term. Beaumont won a slim 28-23 majority in the vote ahead of his vice-chairman Pichot, who will be replaced by Frenchman Bernard Laporte.
Here we look at the biggest challenges which will be facing Beaumont:

    <h5 class="mb-1">SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster in the dark over “vague allegations”</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Scottish Professional Football League chief executive Neil Doncaster says he is in the dark over Rangers’ insistence he is suspended from his role following the vote to end the Scottish league season.
Rangers claimed to have “alarming” evidence that raised serious concerns over the process of the recent ballot on the termination of the season and called for Doncaster and SPFL legal advisor Rod McKenzie to be suspended, but refused to hand over any proof.
The Gers also accused the SPFL of “bullying” clubs into voting for the plan to end the three lower divisions and possibly the Premiership, which was backed by four out of five clubs.

“We’ve had all sorts of rumour and innuendo, vague allegations but nothing specific. It’s not even a question of evidence. We don’t even know what the charges are.
“I’m hearing that this alleged dossier of evidence is due to be circulated this week. We look forward to seeing what’s in it because the sooner we can get this dealt with and move on the better.”
“It’s extremely disappointing that these vague allegations are out there with no one actually coming forward and saying, ‘I was bullied by someone within the SPFL staff’.
“I do not believe for a moment that anyone has been bullied by a member of the SPFL staff. Least of all myself.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chief executive Neil Doncaster is "entirely mystified" by what evidence Rangers have against him and the SPFL, and denies any allegations of bullying.
Rangers have said they can prove a "lack of fair play" in April's SPFL ballot to end the lower leagues and have forced an EGM on 12 May. They also called for Doncaster and SPFL legal adviser Rod McKenzie to be suspended.
"It has been several weeks and we've had absolutely no idea what it was that we were supposed to have done wrong," Doncaster told Sportsound.
"We've had all sorts of rumour and innuendo, vague allegations but nothing specific. It's not even a question of evidence. We don't even know what the charges are.
"I'm hearing that this alleged dossier of evidence is due to be circulated this week. We look forward to seeing what's in it because the sooner we can get this dealt with and move on the better."
Doncaster said he assumed Rangers had something "pretty powerful" given their actions. However, he insisted that nobody had come to the SPFL with any claims of bullying.
"It's extremely disappointing that these vague allegations are out there with no one actually coming forward and saying 'I was bullied by someone within the SPFL staff'," he said.
"I do not believe for a moment that anyone has been bullied by a member of the SPFL staff. Least of all myself."
In a wide-ranging interview on BBC Radio Scotland's Sportsound, Doncaster also said:

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19 infections at Cologne raise questions over safety of Bundesliga's return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Covid-19 infection of three people at German top-flight football team FC Cologne has raised questions about the safety of a possible Bundesliga restart amid the coronavirus pandemic.
With the Bundesliga battling to convince the government that the season should restart in May, and with daily infection figures dropping, Cologne announced the positive tests on Friday (May 1).
“Likely two players, one staffer infected,” wrote Karl Lauterbach, senior lawmaker with the Social Democrats, junior partners in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition, on Twitter on Saturday.
“The rest (of the squad) continues to train. Whoever trains with Covid-19 risks damages to lung, heart and kidneys,” added Lauterbach, who is a professor of health economics and epidemiology.
“I am surprised that players are allowing this,” he said in reference to Cologne’s training continuing with the rest of the squad instead of them all being quarantined as a precaution.
“Football should be a model example and not ‘bread and games’,” he said.
Cologne had said all three cases were symptom-free and the individuals were placed in a 14-day quarantine, but the club did not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those concerned, nor did it say whether players were involved.
While Bundesliga clubs have returned to training in small groups in the past weeks after the league was suspended in mid-March, they must wait another week to find out about a possible restart to the season.
The German government on Thursday delayed any decision over a league resumption amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The cash-strapped clubs and league had been hoping for the green light to end the two-month suspension so the league can contractually finish by June 30.
The German Football League has also submitted a health safety plan for games without spectators that foresees regular testing of players but no quarantine for entire squads in cases of positive tests.
Chancellor Merkel has said any decision on if and when sports could resume would be taken on May 6.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FC Koln COVID-19 cases raise question on safety of football restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Berlin: The news of three FC Koln players testing positive for novel coronavirus has raised questions in Germany of the safety behind restarting the football season in May.
A senior lawmaker with the Social Lawmakers, junior partner to Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition, has said that the rest of the squad, who will continue to train, risk damage to lung, heart and kidneys if they are carrying the virus.
"Likely two players, one staffer infected," wrote Karl Lauterbach, who is also a professor of health, economics and epidemiology, on Twitter. "The rest (of the squad) continues to train. Whoever trains with COVID-19 risks damages to lung, heart and kidneys."
Lauterbach expressed surprise that the players are not opposing the continuation of training instead of being quarantined. "Football should be a model example and not 'bread and games'," he said.
The German side recently returned to training in groups and had the entire playing squad, as well as the coaching and background staff tested for the coronavirus this week.
"Three people tested positive, all are symptom-free. After an assessment of the cases by the responsible health authorities, the three people who tested positive will go into a 14-day quarantine at home," FC Koln said in an official statement on their official website.
"FC Koln will not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those affected. FC Koln's training can continue as planned, according to the hygiene and infection control measures that have been in place since April 6th in group training," it added.
German Football League (DFL) Chief Executive Christian Seifert had last week said that it is hoping to restart league football in the country on May 9 provided they get the green light from the country's government. The German football season was halted on March 13 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">AP report: MLB draft still likely to begin on June 10</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK — Major League Baseball owners will discuss a length for the amateur draft next week and are likely to start the selections on the original date of June 10, a person familiar with the deliberations told The Associated Press.
Teams and the players’ association agreed March 26 to a deal that allowed MLB to cut the draft from 40 rounds to as few as five this year and 20 next year, part of a plan to deal with the new coronavirus pandemic that delayed the start of the season and slashed revenue. As part of the agreement, the sides agreed to leave the assigned slot values of draft signing bonuses at the same level in 2020 and 2021 as they were last year.
That left the total of slot values for a 10-round draft this year at $265.5 million, including $29.6 million for rounds six through 10.
MLB proposed to the union that it would guarantee a 10-round draft in exchange for the slot values for rounds 6-10 being cut by 50%. The union rejected that plan, a person familiar with the decision said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the move was not announced.
The union’s decision to reject the plan was first reported by The Athletic and the move to keep the draft on June 10 by the New York Post.
Rather than resume negotiations, teams intend to debate the size of the draft and make a decision, the person said.
Signing bonus pools started in 2012 and limit the amount of money teams can spend. Each slot in the first 10 rounds is a signed a value — the range last year was $8,415,300 down to $142,200 — and each team’s values are added to a form a pool. Signing bonuses in the first 10 rounds count against the pool along with the amounts above $125,000 of players selected after the 10th round or who were bypassed in the draft and then signed.
A team that exceeds it pool is taxed, and a club more than 5% above loses a first-round draft pick the next year — a threshold never reached.
As part of the March agreement, players and teams agreed that any draft-eligible player not selected this year or next would be limited to a signing bonus of no more than $20,000.
MLB’s offer that the union rejected included an additional limit of only five bypassed players at up to $20,000, with the rest held to a maximum of $5,000.
The union agreed in March that signing bonuses can be deferred: up to $100,000 will be due within 30 days of approval, and 50% of the rest payable on July 1 in each of the following two years.

Teams and the players’ association agreed March 26 to a deal that allowed MLB to cut the draft from 40 rounds to as few as five this year and 20 next year, part of a plan to deal with the new coronavirus pandemic that delayed the start of the season and slashed revenue. As part of the agreement, the sides agreed to leave the assigned slot values of draft signing bonuses at the same level in 2020 and 2021 as they were last year.
That left the total of slot values for a 10-round draft this year at $265.5 million, including $29.6 million for rounds six through 10.
MLB proposed to the union that it would guarantee a 10-round draft in exchange for the slot values for rounds 6-10 being cut by 50%. The union rejected that plan, a person familiar with the decision said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the move was not announced.
The union’s decision to reject the plan was first reported by The Athletic and the move to keep the draft on June 10 by the New York Post.
Rather than resume negotiations, teams intend to debate the size of the draft and make a decision, the person said.
Signing bonus pools started in 2012 and limit the amount of money teams can spend. Each slot in the first 10 rounds is a signed a value — the range last year was $8,415,300 down to $142,200 — and each team’s values are added to a form a pool. Signing bonuses in the first 10 rounds count against the pool along with the amounts above $125,000 of players selected after the 10th round or who were bypassed in the draft and then signed.
A team that exceeds it pool is taxed, and a club more than 5% above loses a first-round draft pick the next year — a threshold never reached.
As part of the March agreement, players and teams agreed that any draft-eligible player not selected this year or next would be limited to a signing bonus of no more than $20,000.
MLB’s offer that the union rejected included an additional limit of only five bypassed players at up to $20,000, with the rest held to a maximum of $5,000.
The union agreed in March that signing bonuses can be deferred: up to $100,000 will be due within 30 days of approval, and 50% of the rest payable on July 1 in each of the following two years.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NBA postpones draft lottery, combine</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NBA haspostponed its annual draftlotteryand predraft scouting combine, citing the coronavirus pandemic, the league announced Friday.
Both events werescheduled to take place in May in Chicago.
The decision came out of a conference callwith the league's Board of Governors,whichvoted to postpone the lottery and combine but delayeddecidingon the draft itself, which is scheduled for June 25.

The group also discussed the possibility of moving the start of the 2020-21 season back to December, according to ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski. While the discussions were not definitive, pushing back the league calendar may increase the chances ofgames to be played with fans inside arenas.
The news comes at a key time for the league, with some player agents and team personnel reportedly calling for the remainder of the 2019-20 season to be canceled. LeBron James, however, spoke out in support of finishing the campaign on Twitter on Thursday.
The scouting combine typically involves about 70 players — along with front office personnel, doctors and members of the media — gathering to run drills, play games against one another and receive medical examinations.
The NBAwas the first major sports league in the United States to suspend play because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and no games have taken place sinceMarch 11.The league has missed 259 regular-season gamesduringthe shutdown.

    <h5 class="mb-1">NBA pushes back draft combine, draft lottery</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The NBA is delaying the draft lottery and draft combine, events scheduled for Chicago later this month.
The league made the decision Friday, though it has been expected for some time. The lottery cannot occur until the regular season is completed or is declared over, because team records determine the odds that the 14 non-playoff teams will have of securing the right to pick No. 1 overall in the draft.
MAVERICKS OWNER MARK CUBAN 'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC' NBA CAN FINISH SEASON
For now, the draft remains scheduled for June 25 — though that, too, will likely have to change in the coming weeks as the league continues reacting to the coronavirus pandemic.
The lottery was to have taken place May 19. The draft combine was to have run from May 21-24.
The league typically invites about 70 players to the combine, where some of the candidates work out and play in scrimmages and others skip the on-court events entirely and just interview with teams instead. The combine has also been a chance for teams to conduct physicals with players, a key component of the evaluation process.
The NBA has been looking at several options for weeks about the draft schedule and pre-draft events, just as the league has when it comes to possibilities for resuming the season when public health officials say that would be appropriate.
“There are no target dates. There are more target responsibilities,” San Antonio CEO R.C. Buford said earlier this week. “And there’s still questions. We just got the early entry candidates list in the last couple days. That at least gives some kind of clarity on who the draft pool will be. But from there, we don’t have clarity on the Chicago pre-draft or medicals or all the things that go on with draft preparation.”

The NBA has not played since March 11, when it became the first of the major U.S. pro sports leagues to suspend games because of the pandemic. The league has missed 259 regular-season games because of the shutdown, and the playoffs would have started about two weeks ago.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ANKARA: With the future of pro basketball uncertain in the shadow of coronavirus, the NBA has postponed its annual draft lottery and draft combine.
The draft lottery was to be held this month in Chicago, while the draft combine was set for May 19-24.
"More information on each event will be shared at a later date as the NBA continues to closely monitor the coronavirus pandemic and consult with infectious disease specialists, public health experts and government officials,” said a NBA statement.
The 2019-20 NBA season has been suspended since March 11 and there has been no decision yet on its resumption.
On Monday, the NBA announced it will not allow teams to reopen training facilities until at least May 8 to give them more time to implement new safety guidelines.
The US is the world’s hardest-hit country in the COVID-19 pandemic, with over 1.10 million cases and more than 65,000 deaths.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cleveland Indians’ pitcher Emmanuel Clase was suspended 80 games after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs, Major League Baseball announced Friday.
The Office of the Commissioner of Baseball issued a statement that the decision came after the 22-year-old right-hander had tested positive for Boldenon, an anabolic steroid.
BARRY BONDS SAYS ACHIEVING HOME RUN MILESTONES IN SAN FRANCISCO WAS NO COINCIDENCE: REPORT 
“The Office of the Commissioner of Baseball announced today that Cleveland Indians pitcher Emmanuel Clase has received an 80-game suspension without pay after testing positive for Boldenone, a performance-enhancing substance, in violation of Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program.”
The Indians said they were “disappointed” by Clase's suspension.
“We fully support Major League Baseball’s policy and its efforts to eliminate performance-enhancing drugs from our game,” the team said in a statement. “We have been in contact with Emmanuel, and we will welcome him back after the discipline has been served. ”
Clase’s suspension will be on hold as the 2020 regular season, which was set to begin on March 26, continues to be delayed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
If the season doesn't cover 80 games, MLB and the players' association are still working out if any carryover will apply for 2021.

Clase is expected to make $564,800 this season after being acquired by Cleveland in the big offseason trade that sent two-time Cy Young winner Corey Kluber to the Texas Rangers.
He remains in the Dominican Republic where he has been since the season was put on hold.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Indians’ Emmanuel Clase banned 80 games for PED violation</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CLEVELAND — Whenever the Cleveland Indians finally get to start their season they won’t have reliever Emmanuel Clase.
The hard-throwing right-hander was suspended 80 games by Major League Baseball on Friday for testing positive for a banned performance-enhancing drug.
Clase was the biggest acquisition by Cleveland in the big offseason trade that sent two-time Cy Young winner Corey Kluber to the Texas Rangers. The commissioner’s office said the 22-year-old Clase tested positive for Boldenone, an anabolic steroid.
Clase was expected to have a major role at the back end of the Indians’ bullpen this season.
His suspension will not begin until the start of the 2020 regular season, which has been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If the season doesn’t cover 80 games, MLB and the players’ association are still working out if any carry over will apply for 2021.
The regular season was scheduled to open March 26.
The Indians said they were “disappointed” by Clase’s suspension.
“We fully support Major League Baseball’s policy and its efforts to eliminate performance-enhancing drugs from our game,” the team said in a statement. “We have been in contact with Emmanuel, and we will welcome him back after the discipline has been served. ”
The Indians sent Kluber, the ace of their staff for the past five years, to Texas in December for outfielder Delino DeShields and Clase, whose fastball has been clocked at over 100 mph. Clase strained a shoulder muscle in spring training and didn’t appear in an exhibition game before the virus outbreak shut baseball down.
Clase returned to the Dominican Republic once the season was put on hold.
He made his debut with the Rangers in August. Clase appeared in 21 games, going 2-3 with a 2.31 ERA. He struck out 21 in 23 1-3 innings.
Clase is scheduled to make $564,800 this season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cleveland Indians reliever Emmanuel Clase suspended 80 games for PEDs</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">May 1 (UPI) -- Cleveland Indians right-hander Emmanuel Clase was suspended 80 games after testing positive for a banned performance-enhancing drug, MLB announced Friday.
Clase tested positive for Boldenone, an anabolic steroid, according to a statement from the league. His suspension won't begin until the start of the 2020 regular season, which has been delayed because of the coronavirus pandemic.
"We are disappointed to learn of today's suspension of Emmanuel Clase for violating Major League Baseball's Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program," the Indians said in a statement. "We fully support Major League Baseball's policy and its efforts to eliminate performance-enhancing drugs from our game.
"We have been in contact with Emmanuel, and we will welcome him back after the discipline has been served. Per the protocol outlined by Major League Baseball's collective bargaining agreement, we will not comment further on the circumstances surrounding this announcement."
Clase, 22, was Cleveland's biggest acquisition in the off-season trade that sent two-time AL Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber to the Texas Rangers. Clase was expected to have a significant role in the Indians' bullpen this year.
Clase made his MLB debut with the Rangers in August. He appeared in 21 games last season, posting a 2-3 record and 2.31 ERA. He recorded 21 strikeouts in 23 1/3 innings.

    <h5 class="mb-1">How Barcelona could line up with Miralem Pjanic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Bosnia-Herzegovina international, who allegedly 'dreams' of joining the Spanish champions, has been strongly linked with a move away from Turin in recent weeks.
Barca are said to have made significant progress in their bid to sign the 30-year-old, who has scored three times and contributed four assists in 32 appearances for Juve this season.
The midfielder has won three Serie A titles and two Coppas Italia since joining the Old Lady, while he has been named in the Serie A Team of the Year in each of the last four campaigns.
Barca vice-president Jordi Cardonerhas suggested that the Catalan giants will be looking to swap rather than buy players during this summer's transfer window, but it is still expected to be a relatively busy market for Quique Setien's side.
Here, Sports Mole looks at how the Spanish champions could line up if they bring Pjanic to Camp Nou ahead of the 2020-21 campaign.
Barca continue to be linked with a move for Inter Milan's Lautaro Martinez, but a recent report claimed that the club were struggling to agree a deal with the Italian giants.
It would certainly not be a surprise to see Martinez arrive this summer, but Setien has all but ruled out a swoop for Paris Saint-Germain attacker Neymar due to the finances involved.
Antoine Griezmann is one of nine players at Barca allegedly available for purchase ahead of the 2020-21 campaign, although it would be a surprise to see the France international depart due to current circumstances, and he could therefore start next season on the left.
Lionel Messi, Marc-Andre ter Stegen, Jordi Alba, Gerard Pique and Frenkie de Jong will be certain starters, while Sergi Roberto, Clement Lenglet and Sergio Busquets should all keep their spots in the XI too.
Pjanic has largely operated as the deepest of three central midfielders for Juve, but Busquets is unlikely to be dropped for any extended period of time, while De Jong has impressed in a left-sided position.
As a result, Pjanic could be handed the spot on the right of a central three, and Barca would be signing a player capable of contributing in terms of goals and assists. Indeed, he has scored 22 times and registered 36 assists in 167 outings for Juve, while he provided 30 goals and 44 assists in 185 appearances for Roma.
This season, the midfielder has a pass success rate of just under 90% in Serie A, while he has provided, on average, just over one key pass per match.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Neymar might consider a transfer offer away from Barcelona</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Despite displaying incredible form by scoring18 goals and providing 10 assists in 22 matches across all competitions Neymar wants to leave Paris Saint-Germain and return back to Barcelona. Lionel Messi has succeeded in pressurising Bartomeu to make Neymar the club’s primary transfer target in the upcoming transfer window.
The Spanish giants are in a great deal of financial strain caused by the outbreak of coronavirus and are finding it extremely tough to fulfil Messi’s demand to bring Neymar back to the Camp Nou. The Parisians will try to recover the most out of the 222 million euros they spent to sign the Brazilian, but have reportedly agreed to reduce his asking price to 164 million euros now.
To make matters worse for Barcelona, Don Balon has stated that Manchester United has joined the race to sign Neymar in the upcoming transfer window. The Red Devils are in a stage of re-establishing the attack in their squad and plan on offering 165 million euros to get the Brazil international to the Old Trafford to play alongside the creative minds of Paul Pogba and Bruno Fernandes. He is yet to respond to the interest shown by Manchester United and might be waiting to see if the Red Devils manage to qualify for the Champions League next season.
Barca mustn’t let the Brazilian superstar join the English giants as they will lose out on the opportunity to bring in a potential successor to Messi. Signing Neymar will also help improve the captain’s morale in the club which hasn’t been great ever since his conflict with the club’s director Eric Abidal.
Another benefit of signing the Brazilian international is that it will release the pressure of Ansu Fati and Antoine Griezmann who have been overused and overstretched this season due to the injury of Luis Suarez.
The Blaugrana must fast-track the sales of their players such as Philippe Coutinho, Arturo Vidal, Ivan Rakitic and Samuel Umtiti to gather sufficient funds to submit a lucrative transfer offer for Neymar. Barcelona could potentially even try to include these players as add-ons in the future transfer offers in order to tempt PSG to reduce their asking price.
Do you think Barca will be able to sign Neymar Junior in the upcoming transfer window?

    <h5 class="mb-1">Now or never for Pjanic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Juventus player is still closer to moving to Barcelona. 'AS' highlighted that Barca want to build a team which is ready to perform at their best in Messi's final few years at the club.
Miralem Pjanic's signing is starting to become a priority for Barcelona. The Bosnian has always been liked and linked with Barca on quite a few occasions, especially in the year he moved to Juventus from Roma.
Pjanic has just turned 30 so you cannot think of him as a long term signing and it catches the attention that, to get him, Barca are considering getting rid of Arthur Melo, who will turn 24 in a few months.
The creative midfielder is good at striking the ball from set pieces although Messi could also do that. He is like Luka Modric, but he reaches the opposition box more and is a bit less creative.
In 2016, Barca ended up going for Andre Gomes instead of the Bosnian and it proved to be a mistake.
Curiously, Pjanic is a player who has well liked at Barca since his time at Lyon. A goal of his against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu when he was just 19, saw Real Madrid get knocked out of the Champions League in the 2009-10 season.
He played for three seasons at Lyon and the 2008-09 campaign was precisely his best one. The Bosnian midfielder played more games in any season of his career, 53, and scored 11 goals as well as getting 13 assists.
But that was a decade ago. He then played for five seasons at Roma before going to Juventus where he has continued to show his class.
Barca are still fighting to sign him because they see him as the perfect reinforcement in midfield. The question is whether Arthur will stay and be used from time to time instead of Pjanic or whether the Brazilian will leave the club.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marcelo Discusses Leaving Real Madrid & Wades in on Lionel Messi/Cristiano Ronaldo Debate</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Long serving Real Madrid defender Marcelo has no plans to leave the club this summer, and has no inclination that he will be sold.
The 31-year-old has become part of the Santiago Bernabeu furniture, making over 500 appearances in all competitions after joining from Fluminense in 2007.
The Brazilian has come under pressure from summer signing Ferland Mendy for a regular first team place this season, limiting him to just 11 La Liga appearances before football was forced to take an extended break due to the coronavirus pandemic.
But Marcelo's lack of minutes hasn't called his loyalty to the club into question, though, with an Instagram Q&A with former teammate Fabio Cannavaro revealing that he has no plans to go anywhere just yet, despite past interest from Juventus.
"I don't want to leave and I don't think Real Madrid will sell me," Marcelo said, in quotes carried by Marca.
"I have done very well at Madrid since arriving. It's been a long time and it's an incredible story. I do think it's good that other teams are interested in me, but I don't know about Juventus.
"Two years ago I had already signed with them [Juventus], and had their shirt on because I couldn't live without Cristiano Ronaldo. People make up a lot of things."
Inevitably, after spending the best part of a decade playing with Ronaldo, Marcelo was also quizzed about whether the Portuguese star is better than Barcelona's Lionel Messi.
His reply was diplomatic enough, praising both for differing qualities, adding that it's impossible to say one way or the other.
"You can't say who is better," Marcelo retorted. "I played with Cristiano for 10 years, and the motivation he gives you is unique, how he raises your own game. You think Messi is under control, then out of nowhere he scores a goal."
When Marcelo eventually does leave Real Madrid, he'll depart as one of the most decorated players in the club's history. To date, he has won 21 honours - including four Champions League titles and four La Liga crowns.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marcelo addresses Real Madrid future amid Juventus talk</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Brazil international, who has made over 500 appearances for Madrid since arriving in 2007, has been strongly linked with Juventus over the last few weeks.
The 31-year-old has allegedly been identified by the Italian champions as a leading target ahead of this summer's transfer window, and it has been suggested that the left-back is keen to move to Turin in order to reunite with Cristiano Ronaldo.
However, Marcelo has firmly shut down rumours that he could leave Zinedine Zidane's side ahead of the 2020-21 campaign.
"I heard two years that I had agreed to join Juventus, and follow Cristiano to Italy. People enjoy creating these rumours," Marcelo said on an Instagram Live. "I did not want to leave, and I don't think Madrid would have let me go. I am very well here in Madrid, and I do not want to leave."
The South American, who has shared the Madrid left-back spot with Frenchman Ferland Mendy this season, has a contract at the Bernabeu until the summer of 2022.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With Neymar being linked with a return to FC Barcelona next season, Blaugrana coach Quique Setien has finally responded to reports of a big-money move for the Brazilian.
Click through the gallery to see Barca's top five expensive signings.
The Brazil international shocked the footballing world in 2017 when he left Barcelona for Paris Saint-Germain in a world record move worth €222million.
However, it's not gone according to plan for the attacker whose three years in the French capital has been hampered by injuries.
While Kylian Mbappe has also been touted to move on from PSG in the near future, Neymar was reportedly eager to return to Barcelona this season but the two clubs could not come to an agreement.
It seems it will be more of the same ahead of next season, with Setien ruling out a big-money transfer for the 28-year-old.
"€222 million for him? No. I don't think there is anyone who can spend that much," Setien told Gazzetta dello Sport.
"And small clubs have water in their throats. Many of them lived to the limit and at the first serious jolt they went into crisis. Football lived at an uncontrolled pace."

In his three years with the club, Neymar only notched up 80 appearances, scoring 69 goals and assisting a further 39.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Eduardo Camavinga makes decision over Man Utd or Real Madrid transfer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Eduardo Camavinga will reject a move to Manchester United or Real Madrid this summer, according to Rennes manager Julien Stephan.
The 17-year-old made his senior debut a year ago and has already established himself as a regular in Rennes’ midfield this season.
Camavinga is rated as one of the best young talents in France and the midfielder has attracted strong interest from Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane.
Manchester United are also keen on a deal for the France Under-21 international but Rennes claim that Camavinga has chosen to stay in Ligue 1 for another season.
‘It is undoubtedly good news to play in the Champions League for him to stay,’ Stephan told Ouest France.
‘He has a good environment [around him], he is very tied to the club he came through at, to the people around him, and if he plays in the Champions League he will help us.
‘Contrary to what I have read, his intention is to stay with us.
‘He knows that now, after this season, the best thing for him and the most positive thing is to impress in the Champions League with us.
‘I took Eduardo up [to the first team] because I knew him very well from the B team, he had just turned 16 and I knew that, above all, he was mentally prepared.
‘The idea was to start training with the team, because he was very mature, and at the beginning we had to integrate him, without participating, to work every day and learn from the senior players.
‘It was better to make him debut at home because it was the right time.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">"Camavinga's desire is to stay"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rennes manager, Julien Stéphan, spoke on 'Ouest France' about Camavinga's future and made it harder for those that want him, especially Real Madrid: "His desire is still to continue".
Lately, the news that emanates from Eduardo Camavinga's circle doesn't facilitate a possible move to Real Madrid at all. This time it was his manager, Julien Stéphan, who came to the fore to reassure the Rennes fans.
Speaking to the newspaper 'Ouest France', he was clear about what he thinks of the possibility of the young midfielder changing teams at the moment.  "Contrary to what I have read, his desire is still to continue," he said.
According to Stéphan, who Camaviga still has a good relationship with, his maturing process is still incomplete. "Those close to him prepare his career for the medium and long term. He is attached to his training club, to the people he meets here. He knows he still has to confirm himself at the highest level, especially in Champions League matches. After that, we'll see a start somewhere else," he said. 
Anyway, these words don't completely close the door to a change of team, as one of the formulas that Real Madrid are managing is buying him now and leaving him one more year at Rennes until he turns 18.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barcelona nearing swap deal with Juventus for the summer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Barcelona awaits Arthur’s ‘Yes’ to secure a swap for one of the named Juventus players. The Brazilian could be playing alongside Cristiano Ronaldo in Serie A next season.
Juventus had enquired about the possible sale for the 23-year-old weeks ago as manager Maurizio Sarri considers the youngster as a vital part for developing the Italian club.
Mundo Deportivo has reported that the agreement reached is that Arthur will head to Turin in exchange for one of their midfielders, Miralem Pjanic, Rodrigo Bentancur, or Federico Bernardeschi. According to La Gazetta dello Sport and Tuttosport, however, Pjanic is the chosen one and will be heading to the Nou Camp.
The biggest issue for the Italian side is that Arthur has made it clear that he wants to continue with Barca and has no intention of leaving. The talented midfielder joined the Catalans in 2018 from Gremio for a fee of €31 million and has been acclaimed by many as the future of Barca midfield alongside Frenkie de Jong.
Paris Saint-Germain have also shown their interest in the Brazilian and are willing to include Leandro Paredes in an exchange offer. Inter Milan are also believed to be interested and might even reduce Lautaro Martinez‘s transfer fee in exchange.
Reports, however, claim Juventus is leading the race, who are also holding talks with Manchester United for midfielder Paul Pogba, even agreeing to include Douglas Costa or Alex Sandro in the deal. Juve’s Pjanic has spoken to Barca’s former vice-president claiming that playing for Blaugrana has been his dream.
Should Barca finalize the deal or keep Arthur Melo for the future.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MADRID: Real Madrid defender Marcelo said that he does not want to leave and neither would the La Liga giants let him go amidst links with Juventus.
The Brazilian has been linked with a move away from Madrid, where he has enjoyed a successful stay since arriving from Fluminense in 2007.
"I don't want to leave and I don't think Madrid would let me anyway. I'm really happy here. Since I came here with my family, it's been incredible," he told Fabio Cannavaro during an Instagram Live chat on Friday.
"I don't really know if it's true that Juve wanted to sign me to be honest," he added.

He has continued to be linked to Juventus, the club his former teammate Cristiano Ronaldo joined in 2018.
"A couple of years ago I heard that I'd signed for Juve, that I'd already pulled on the Juve shirt and that I couldn't live without Cristiano," Marcelo said.
"People invent a lot of things. It was all fine with me, as I saw that some Juve fans quite liked the idea of me joining," he added.
Marcelo made 505 appearances for the Spanish side across all competitions.
He has won La Liga title four times and has claimed the Champions League on four other occasions with Madrid.

    <h5 class="mb-1">I don't want to leave Real Madrid, Marcelo</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">CAIRO_2 May 2020: Real Madrid Brazilian defender, Marcelo, stated that he doesn't want to leave Real Madrid and denied news linked him with a move to Juventus. "I have done very well at Madrid since arriving. It's been a long time and it's an incredible story. I don't want to leave and I don't think Real Madrid will sell me," Marcelo said. The Brazilian joined Real Madrid in 2008 from his childhood club, Fluminense, and he is now the vice-captain of the club. Marcelo added "I do think it's good that other teams are interested in me, but I don't know about Juventus. People make up a lot of things." During his time with Los Blancos, Marcelo won four Laliga titles, two Copa del Rey titles as well as four UEFA Champions League titles in five years. Football competitions worldwide have been halted due to coronavirus and footballers like everyone in the community stayed at home and are out of the training sessions. Marcelo revealed his daily routine in quarantine, saying "I only go out once a day with my four dogs. People here are respecting the rules, but it has been very hard."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus wrap: Serie A training boost but international rugby under question</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Serie A clubs are preparing to reopen the doors of their training grounds in the coming days, but World Rugby’s re-elected chairman Sir Bill Beaumont admits the idea of resuming sport across international borders represents a much thornier proposition.
A reported change of heart by the Italian government is set to see Italian footballers return to club facilities from Monday as part of a phased easing of coronavirus restrictions.
Team sports were not due to be cleared until May 18 but, with some regional assemblies taking the view that they should be granted similar rights as individual athletes, sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora sought a review.
Both Corriere dello Sport and Gazzetta dello Sport quoted a communique, signed by interior minister Matteo Piantedosi, which allowed for high performance centres to begin operation again provided social distancing measures are observed.
Individual teams are likely to pursue their own arrangements now, steered by regional guidelines and their own preparedness to safely staff facilities.
As yet there is no certainty that the Serie A season will resume, with Juventus currently top of the paused table just a point ahead of Lazio.
The complexity of the issues facing Beaumont, who saw his mandate renewed for another four years after seeing off challenger Agustin Pichot in a ballot, are even greater. With different countries, regions and hemispheres to consider, the idea of getting the international game up and running smoothly could be problematic.
“We don’t know when we are going to come out of it. Some countries are coming out of it quicker than others,” he said.
“We still have to plan the international games, the domestic games, and already you can see there is difference of opinions from country to country whereby last week the French government said there would be no sport played at all until September 1, and in the UK there is still a desire to get some club games started before then.
“You don’t know if there’s going to be any inter-hemisphere travel at all this year. You don’t know whether you can start behind closed doors, we don’t know when that will be. Everything at the moment is scenario planning: what if, what if, what if.”
In England, football finance expert Kieran Maguire says lower league clubs have been “taken out at the knees” by the pandemic.
There have been countless warnings about clubs going to the wall and League Two side Bradford revealed on Friday they had been informed that there is the “ever-growing possibility of supporters being unable to attend matches until 2021”.
Maguire, a lecturer in football finance at the University of Liverpool, said: “The clubs in the lower leagues, most of them have got fairly precarious finances to begin with and have been operating on a week-to-week basis in terms of meeting their financial obligations, paying the rent, paying the wage bill, paying the council tax and so on,” he told the PA news agency.
“And that’s during a season when they were having regular fixtures. How clubs can address that is beyond me if there is no money coming in through the turnstiles, which accounts for around 40 to 50 per cent of total income for some League One and League Two clubs.”
Meanwhile, Scottish Football Association vice-president and Alloa chairman Mike Mulraney has likened Rangers’ dispute with the league to “baldy men fighting over a comb”.
Rangers, allied with Hearts and Stranraer, have prompted an SPFL general meeting on May 12 to decide whether there should be an independent investigation into the process around the vote to end the season.
Mulraney told BBC Radio Scotland’s Sportsound programme: “Of course it’s important in the context of the event but in the context of what Scottish football is facing, it’s like me and another four baldy guys fighting over a comb.
“It’s not really going to impact the long-term future of Scottish football.”
Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome believes a version of the race without fans with a new start date of August 29 will be possible, but questioned how easy it will be to keep committed supporters away.
“In theory, we can put the race on but I think the bigger question is would the organisers be able to keep people from actually coming out and gathering in large crowds? I think that’s the bigger question,” he said on Instagram Live.

    <h5 class="mb-1">FIFA vice-president ponders calendar year season in Europe</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ROME - FIFA vice-president Victor Montagliani has said that moving the European soccer season to the calendar year is a “possibility to be discussed” in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic which has brought football to a standstill around the world.
In an interview with Italy’s Radio Sportiva, Montagliani, who is seen as a close ally of FIFA president Gianni Infantino, said the move would fit in with the 2022 World Cup being played in Qatar in November and December.
The head of world soccer’s governing body himself has said that football will be totally different when it restarts and that the current stoppage could be a good chance to overhaul the overloaded calendar which is due to run until 2024.
“We have the opportunity because the World Cup in Qatar in 2022 will be played in November/December and that could be the idea,” said Montagliani, who is president of the CONCACAF confederation.
“Here in the Americas, the season is already played according to the calendar year, perhaps it is a solution that could also be used in Europe and Africa, it is a possibility to be discussed at national and continental level,” he said.
“It is not an idea to be discarded, it can be a solution in view of the next two years and this winter World Cup”.
A number of European leagues, including Italy, Germany and England, still hope to finish their seasons but doing so could force the start of the 2020-21 campaign to be pushed back. UEFA also wants to finish the Champions League and Europa League.
“We had already started thinking about how to set a new calendar from 2024, now with this crisis, we need immediate answers,” added Montagliani.
The idea of a calendar-year season has been put forward before including by Karl-Heinz Rummenigge when he was chairman of the European Club Association (ECA).
“Everywhere, be it Germany, France or England, summer is the best period of the year. And that is the season we don’t play,” he told France Football magazine in a 2013 interview.
“In deepest winter, when it is very cold and snowing, we play nearly all the time in conditions that are disagreeable for both players and spectators. It is not logical.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">British Grand Prix 'not a given' in Formula 1, says Silverstone boss Stuart Pringle</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">London: This year's British Grand Prix "is not a given" even without spectators and the decision depends on others, Silverstone managing director Stuart Pringle said on Saturday.
Formula One plans to start the season, put on hold by the COVID-19 pandemic, with two races behind closed doors in Austria in early July before potentially two more at Silverstone.
Any races will need government approval, with countries in various stages of lockdown with restrictions on movement and mass events.
Silverstone is keen to help the sport back on track but announced this week any race could only go ahead without spectators.
"The end of April (decision deadline) for us was if we had to start putting up temporary infrastructure for hospitality and dealing with the public and stuff," Pringle told Reuters.
"We are only working on fixed infrastructure (now) so it's an awful lot less.
"I'm confident we could operate well within F1's decision-making cycle," he said of any new deadline. "I think they are the ones who have got to make the decision." Formula One's managing director Ross Brawn said the sport wanted to create a "kind of biosphere" at circuits.
That would involve getting everyone who entered the circuit tested and cleared for the coronavirus and then keeping them in a controlled environment.
"Austria fits that bill very well. It's got a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It's not too close to a metropolis, it has a great infrastructure around it," Brawn told an F1 podcast.
"There will be no motorhomes, but there will be a full catering facility laid on that the circuit has."
Formula One insiders have spoken of teams staying at secure hotels with no interaction with local residents and no media access.
Pringle said Silverstone, a home race for seven of the 10 teams, could offer security.
"In the discussions within sport, about restarting in the UK, there's been talk about the need for sites to be a bit like an island. To be controlled. We can achieve that," he said.
"We have all the facilities we need inside the circuit with the exception of a complete hotel. We have a half-built hotel, if that helps anyone.
Silverstone, a former World War Two airfield in central England, has a 222 hectare site with a nearly 8km perimeter fence.
The Wing building is some 400m long and can deliver 4,500 sit down lunches simultaneously with its own kitchens and five separate halls.
"We'd comfortably cater for everybody associated with putting it on," said Pringle. "We could separate people and shifts... we're ideally placed." Silverstone is already used to teams using the circuit for private testing, away from prying eyes.
Pringle also made clear that everything had to be done so as not to put stress on policing or divert medical resources away from the fight against the coronavirus.
"I'm very clear we cannot be any sort of burden or the slightest impact on that. And if we are this isn't going to happen," he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Premier League can overcome restart challenges, says Brady</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: This year’s British Grand Prix “is not a given” even without spectators and the decision depends on others, Silverstone managing director Stuart Pringle said on Saturday.
Formula One plans to start the season, put on hold by the COVID-19 pandemic, with two races behind closed doors in Austria in early July before potentially two more at Silverstone.
Any races will need government approval, with countries in various stages of lockdown with restrictions on movement and mass events.
Silverstone is keen to help the sport back on track but announced this week any race could only go ahead without spectators.
“The end of April (decision deadline) for us was if we had to start putting up temporary infrastructure for hospitality and dealing with the public and stuff,” said Pringle.
“We are only working on fixed infrastructure (now) so it’s an awful lot less.
“I’m confident we could operate well within F1’s decision-making cycle,” he said of any new deadline. 
“I think they are the ones who have got to make the decision.”
Formula One’s managing director Ross Brawn said the sport wanted to create a “kind of biosphere” at circuits.
That would involve getting everyone who entered the circuit tested and cleared for the coronavirus and then keeping them in a controlled environment.
“Austria fits that bill very well. It’s got a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It’s not too close to a metropolis, it has a great infrastructure around it,” Brawn told an F1 podcast.
“There will be no motorhomes, but there will be a full catering facility laid on that the circuit has.”
Home security
Formula One insiders have spoken of teams staying at secure hotels with no interaction with local residents and no media access.
Pringle said Silverstone, a home race for seven of the 10 teams, could offer security.
“In the discussions within sport, about restarting in the UK, there’s been talk about the need for sites to be a bit like an island. To be controlled. We can achieve that,” he said.
“We have all the facilities we need inside the circuit with the exception of a complete hotel. We have a half-built hotel, if that helps anyone.
Silverstone, a former World War Two airfield in central England, has a 222 hectare site with a nearly 8km perimeter fence.
The Wing building is some 400m long and can deliver 4,500 sit down lunches simultaneously with its own kitchens and five separate halls.
“We’d comfortably cater for everybody associated with putting it on,” said Pringle. 
“We could separate people and shifts ... we’re ideally placed.”
Silverstone is already used to teams using the circuit for private testing, away from prying eyes.
Pringle also made clear that everything had to be done so as not to put stress on policing or divert medical resources away from the fight against the coronavirus.
“I’m very clear we cannot be any sort of burden or the slightest impact on that. And if we are this isn’t going to happen,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Silverstone boss Stuart Pringle warns British Grand Prix 'is not a given' even if it takes place behind closed doors as he urges F1 to make decision on race</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Silverstone managing director Stuart Pringle has warned that this year's British Grand Prix 'is not a given' even if it takes place without spectators.
The coronavirus pandemic has put Formula One's plans to start the season on hold but they are now lining up two races behind closed doors in Austria in early July before potentially two more at Silverstone to kickstart the campaign.
All potential races will need government approval which is further complicated by countries being at different stages of lockdown with restrictions on movement and mass events.
Pringle however maintained that Silverstone is keen to help the sport back on track but announced this week any race could only go ahead without spectators.
'The end of April (decision deadline) for us was if we had to start putting up temporary infrastructure for hospitality and dealing with the public and stuff,' Pringle said.
'We are only working on fixed infrastructure (now) so it's an awful lot less.
'I'm confident we could operate well within F1's decision-making cycle. I think they are the ones who have got to make the decision.'
The comments come after Formula One's managing director Ross Brawn outlined plans for the sport to resume in an isolated environment and create a 'kind of biosphere' at circuits.
'It's a real consideration because one of the logistical challenges is getting everyone tested and cleared to enter the paddock and enter the racing environment,' he said on the official F1 Nation podcast.
'And I think once we do that, it's very attractive to keep everyone in that environment, within that kind of biosphere that we want to create for another race.
'It's also pretty challenging to find the right sort of races early on where we can control the environment well enough.
'Austria fits that bill very well. It's got a local airport right next to the circuit, where people can charter planes into. It's not too close to a metropolis, it has a great infrastructure around it.
'There will be no motorhomes, but there will be a full catering facility laid on that the circuit has.'

    <h5 class="mb-1">Spanish MotoGP rider Joan Mir adds two years to his contract at Suzuki</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">PARIS: Spanish MotoGP rider Joan Mir extended his contract with Suzuki until 2022, two weeks after team-mate and compatriot Alex Rins, the team announced on Saturday.
"The pairing provide a solid and competitive unit for Suzuki as they look towards the future and aim high in terms of results," said a team statement.
Rins, the Moto3 champion in 2017, made his debut in the premier class in 2019. His contract was due to end after this season.
The team statement said that in "pre-season tests he was showing fantastic form and pace."

The MotoGP season should have started in March but is on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Carmelo Ezpeleta, the CEO of promoter Dorna, said he is hoping for a resumption in late July "late July in Europe", presumably without spectators and with a limited number of people in the paddock.
"The current situation surrounding the Covid-19 crisis makes for a strange environment for both the team and the rider at the moment, with so much uncertainty in the air," said Suzuki, adding that the contract extension "proves the confidence" of the team "in their young rider".
Prior to Mir and Rins, six-time Spanish World Champion Marc Marquez extended his contract with Honda for another four years until the end of 2024.
Yamaha re-signed Spaniard Maverick Vinales for the 2021-2022 seasons, and announced the replacement of veteran Italian Valentino Rossi with Frenchman Fabio Quartararo from 2021.
For Rossi, who celebrated his 41st birthday on February 16, this announcement does not necessarily mean the end of his career.
"I'll have to decide without having competed in a single race. Anyway, I want to continue," said Rossi in an online interview last week.
"Imagine not racing this year. It would be fairer to race another season and stop after this one. So I'm hoping to continue in 2021," he said.
On Friday, Spaniard Tito Raba, the 2014 Moto2 cchampion prolonged his contract at Avintia until the end of 2021.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MotoGP news: Joan Mir completes Suzuki 2021 line-up</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Suzuki has completed its rider line-up for the 2021 MotoGP season after re-signing Joan Mir on a new two-year deal.
The 2017 Moto3 world champion followed in the footsteps of Maverick Vinales in making his MotoGP debut with Suzuki last year following a single season in the Moto2 class.
Mir ended last year as the second-best rookie, finishing 12th in the standings with a best result of fifth at the Australian Grand Prix, although he battled with the after-effects of a violent crash during the post-race Brno test, which forced him out of the Austrian and British GPs.
Though he was one of the main targets for Ducati's 2021 line-up, Suzuki team boss Davide Brivio admitted to Autosport last month that everything had been agreed to retain Mir.
Taking to Instagram on Saturday morning, Mir confirmed he had penned a new agreement with Suzuki.
"I'm extremely happy to sign with Suzuki for another two years - renewing is the best thing that could happen and it's a dream come true again," Mir said.
"It's really important for me to continue because now I have more time to learn and more time to show my potential.
"Two years can go by quickly, but I am ready to arrive at a higher level, and we are working every day to make that happen.
"I am also so pleased on a personal level because I have a really good team and crew around me.
"I really want to thank everyone at Suzuki for their confidence in me, and let's see if I can get the results that we're capable of."
In a similar move, Alex Rins announced last month that he'd re-signed with Suzuki for two more years, and later admitted that discussions first began with the Japanese manufacturer last April.
Suzuki is the second manufacturer to firm up its 2021 line-up, after Yamaha confirmed Maverick Vinales and 2019's top rookie Fabio Quartararo on two-year deals.
Honda stunned the paddock in February when it announced it had secured reigning MotoGP world champion Marc Marquez for four more years on a deal rumoured to be worth €100 million.
The coronavirus-forced delay to the 2020 season has complicated the rider market situation, with many deals looking likely to be agreed before any racing has taken place.
Last month, Marquez suggested MotoGP introduce a freeze to rider contracts for 2021, while Petronas SRT boss Razlan Razali said his team would seek to retain Quartararo should 2020 be cancelled altogether.
After the Dutch, German and Finnish Grands Prix were cancelled, the season won't start until the end of July at the earliest, with MotoGP promoters Dorna Sports "optimistic" of getting the campaign underway by then.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Germany international has starred for his current club this season, contributing 25 goals and nine assists in the Bundesliga and Champions League.
However, with a release clause in his contract, the 24-year-old has been frequently linked with a switch to Liverpool during the next transfer window.
According to journalist Nicola Schira, the Merseyside giants and the player's representatives have made significant progress in talks over recent weeks.
Schira claims that Liverpool are prepared to hand Werner a five-year contract worth €10m (£8.87m) per year.
The attacker, who has also been linked with Chelsea, has revealed that he is keen to move abroad in the near future.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Latest Chelsea transfer rumours: Timo Werner drops hint, £75m offer submitted for target</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Chelsea ’s season may be on hold as the world battles the coronavirus crisis, but that has not stopped reports claiming they are looking ahead and planning their summer transfer business.
It remains to be seen when the transfer window will open this summer, as leagues and associations battle to conclude their current campaigns.
But managers, and their recruitment staff, are believed to be keeping busy in isolation by planning deals well in advance, if the latest reports are to be believed.
With that in mind, here are the latest transfer rumours from Stamford Bridge.
RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner's next destination will not be another Bundesliga club.
The striker has been linked with a number of clubs, including Chelsea, Liverpool, Man Utd and Bayern.
But when asked about the latter, Werner hinted at a move abroad should he depart Leipzig.
"Bayern is a great club, we don't need to talk about it, and Hansi Flick has proven this season that he's a really good head coach," Werner told Sport Bild.
"But if a change should ever become an issue, I would rather take a step abroad than switch to Bavaria.
“It's just that the challenge in another league would appeal to me a little more than a change within the Bundesliga. And of course it also plays a role that the mutual appreciation should be there to the maximum.
"That's why I chose RB Leipzig at the time, and because of that, I would choose the club again in my next step, which would give me that feeling. ”
That will come as a big boost for Chelsea should they pursue a move this summer, with Liverpool also said to have dropped out of the race.
Chelsea are closing in on the signing of Derby County youngster Max Bird.
According to Spanish outlet Todo Fichajes, Lampard is looking to prise a talent from his former club.
The report claims a £4.8m deal is on the cards for the 19-year-old midfielder who has already racked up 17 first-team appearances in the league.
Bird came through the academy at Pride Park and unsurprisingly, Derby are reluctant to lose him.
Lille are said to have received a huge £75m offer for Chelsea-linked striker Victor Osimhen.
The Nigerian scored 13 goals for Lille this season, helping them to fourth before the Ligue 1 season was ended.
He also netted 20 for Belgian outfit Charleroi before moving to Ligue 1.
According to a report from Telefoot, Lille have received an offer worth a stunning £75m from an unnamed club.
That could be a blow for Chelsea, unless they are indeed that unnamed club.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Director drops big hint Arsenal-linked £53m ‘huge player’ could move in the summer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Reported Arsenal target Dayot Upamecano could potentially be on the move this summer, with RB Leipzig managing director Oliver Mintzlaff saying his side’s top players will not be leaving for free.
Upamecano is one of the most sought-after defenders in world football at the moment and the fact his contract expires at the end of the 2020-21 season makes him even more appealing to potential suitors.
According to Bild, the 21-year-old is available for around £53million in the summer transfer window and so far he has refused to extend his current deal with RB Leipzig, with Arsenal said to be keen on the centre-back after previously failing to sign him.
In October last year, the Gunners were deemed to be frontrunners for the Frenchman’s signature along with AC Milan (Calciomercato), but since then, numerous other clubs, including Liverpool and Tottenham, have been linked with his services (The Mirror).
Upamecano is also said to be on the wishlists of both Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola and Manchester United counterpart Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, both clubs reportedly interested in bolstering their defensive ranks this summer (Sky Sports).
“We know the terms of our players’ contracts and I know them very well – especially that of our top performers,” Mintzlaff told Sport1, as quoted by the Evening Standard.
“For us, it is a no go that the top performers will be allowed to leave our club free of charge. That’s the case with Timo Werner and that will be the case with Dayot Upamecano. I have the economic stability of the club in mind.”
Aside from the plaudits sent Upamecano’s way – Lothar Matthaus has called him a “huge player” – the France Under-21 defender’s displays have often spoken for themselves, in particular his shutout of Bayern Munich’s Robert Lewandowski in the goalless draw between the two sides earlier this year.
A big, strong centre-back with explosive pace and superb reading of the game, it’s unsurprising to see the Premier League’s top sides all linked with him, and given how much interest there seems to be in him, not to mention the fact he isn’t expected to let his contract run down, there could well be a bidding war this summer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Chief hints at potential summer sale of £53m-rated Man United and Arsenal target</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">According to Goal via Sport1, RB Leipzig chief Oliver Mintzlaff has hinted that the German giants could sell Manchester United and Arsenal target Dayot Upamecano this summer.
The 21-year-old, who Goal claim is also catching the eye of Bayern Munich and Manchester City, is about to enter the final year of his contract – casting doubt over his future with Leipzig.
Mintzlaff seems to be defiant with his statement that ‘it is a no go that the top performers will be allowed to leave our club free of charge’.
Should the Frenchman fail to agree a new contract with the Bundesliga outfit before the summer, Goal claim that Leipzig would move to sell the ace for a fee of €60m (£53m).
Here’s what managing director Oliver Mintzlaff had to say:
“In the Covid-19 crisis, we have other issues greater than concerns about contracts,”
“We know the terms of our players’ contracts and I know them very well – especially that of our top performers.”
“For us, it is a no go that the top performers will be allowed to leave our club free of charge.”
“That’s the case with Timo Werner and that will be the case with Dayot Upamecano. I have the economic stability of the club in mind.”
“We have to sell before we buy anything. But I see the need to sell only to a limited extent. We have a good squad,”
“If we can’t finish the season, we don’t have to deal with new transfers at all. It wouldn’t fit into the big financial loss that we have.”
Upamecano has firmly established himself as one of the world’s top defensive talents since joining Leipzig just over three years ago.
The 21-year-old has made 29 appearances for Leipzig this season and he’s continued to show that he’s a real star for the future with some fine performances.
A move to one of the top clubs that are being linked with his services would also massively boost the France Under-21s star’s hopes of breaking into Didier Deschamps’ senior side.
Arsenal and United are particularly in need of bolstering at centre-back in the next transfer window.
Mikel Arteta’s side still possess a shaky defence, the Gunners also need to replace the likes of David Luiz and Sokratis who are approaching the final years of their illustrious careers.
The Red Devils on the other hand need to find a reliable long-term partner for Harry Maguire, who has become the side’s captain just months after joining in a marquee move last summer.
Victor Lindelof and Eric Bailly have proved that they aren’t reliable options due to the Swede’s inconsistent form and the Ivorian’s troubles with injuries.
With all respect, Phil Jones should be completely out of the question as United look for a commanding centre-back to partner Maguire.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">RB Leipzig managing director Olivier Mintzlaff admits Timo Werner and Dayot Upamecano could leave this summer amid reports linking them with Manchester United.
United are keen to bolster their side at the end of the season with German forward Werner currently under consideration, while Upamecano also fulfils their transfer criteria.
The duo have both been linked with moves in the summer transfer window and now Mintzlaff admits Leipzig will likely have to sell a big name if they want to sign anyone this summer.
"In the Covid-19 crisis, we have other issues greater than concerns about contracts," managing director Oliver Mintzlaff told Sport1.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tommy Wright leaves St Johnstone after seven years as manager</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tommy Wright has stepped down as manager of St Johnstone after spending nine years with the Scottish Premiership club.
Wright arrived in Perth in 2011 as assistant manager to Steve Lomas and then took over in the hot seat when his fellow Northern Irishman left for Millwall in June 2013.
He led Saints to their first-ever Scottish Cup success in 2014 and guided the club into the top six of Scotland's top division in his first four seasons in charge.
St Johnstone reached the Europa League qualifying rounds on four occasions under Wright but could not make the group stages.
A club statement read: "Although Tommy still has a further two years of his contract to run, planning has been ongoing for some time between the board and Tommy in respect of the footballing side of the club.
"We all feel that we have been successful in creating a young and exciting squad and the club is well positioned for the future. Having been at the club for almost nine years, Tommy feels this would also be the most suitable time to allow him to take a well-earned break.
"The board will now have the unenviable task of finding a replacement for Tommy once the COVID-19 situation in respect of football is clarified."
Wright added: "I want to take the opportunity to say that the support I have had from the fans has been incredible and contributed immensely to my experience with the club.
"So, to the club, its staff, players and fans - I'll always hold a very special place for you all and I look forward to coming back to McDiarmid Park - I am so proud of what we have achieved together. We have an exciting group of young players and I look forward to seeing their progression with you all."
Wright says the decision to part company had been discussed privately as far back as two seasons ago and that he is ultimately proud of his achievements at the club.
He is also confident he is leaving behind a squad capable of consolidating and improving in future seasons under a new manager.
Speaking to Saints TV, Wright added: "It was extremely difficult, obviously being at the club so long I've got a lot of feelings for the club, lots and lots of happy memories and worked with a lot of good people both on the pitch and off the pitch.
"It was something that was being considered for a while, even as far back as at the end of the season when we finished eighth (in 2017-18).
"We sort of made a decision to see if over the next couple of years we could bring the age of the squad down and it might be time for me to move on. Fortunately, we have done that. There have been two good seasons.
"It's been something that I felt that when you are at a club for a long period of time, sometimes there comes a point where you need a break and I do need a break.
"It's a tough job. People don't give you sympathy being in football management, but it's 365 days and 24 hours a day and I just felt that this season, if we did well, it would have been the perfect time for me to leave the club in a really strong position.
"Hopefully, I think it can be a top-six side and in a really good position. It hasn't been an easy decision but I think it is the right time."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Newcastle player could be set for Northern Ireland job</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">ST JOHNSTONE announced on Saturday that manager Tommy Wright has parted company with the club after a highly successful seven-year stay.
Wright joined the Scottish Premiership side in November 2011 as assistant manager before taking the hot seat in June 2013.
The Northern Irishman led the Saints to their first-ever Scottish Cup success in 2014 and guided the Perth side to several top-six finishes.
St Johnstone reached the Europa League qualifying rounds on four occasions under Wright but could not make the group stages.
The 56-year-old had two years left on his contract, but has been strongly linked with the vacant position of Northern Ireland boss.
Michael O’Neill stepped down as Northern Ireland manager last month to focus on his role in charge of Stoke after the coronavirus outbreak ruined his plan to remain in charge for the European Championship playoffs.
“To the club, its staff, players and fans, I’ll always hold a very special place for you all and I look forward to coming back to McDiarmid Park. I am so proud of what we have achieved together,” said Wright in a statement.
“We have an exciting group of young players and I look forward to seeing their progression with you all.”
St Johnstone said they had planned for the change of manager at the end of the season and the timing of the move is a further indication that Scottish clubs are not expecting to restart the campaign.
A controversial resolution to end the lower leagues has already been passed by the 42 members clubs and the same proposal allows the Scottish Professional Leagues Board (SPFL) to end the Premiership season if it deems that the games cannot be played due to the coronavirus pandemic.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Expect Kohli, Rohit to groom youngsters like Dhoni did: Gambhir</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir expects current captain Virat Kohli and his deputy in limited-overs Rohit Sharma to groom talented youngsters coming into the squad in the manner former skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni used to do during his time at the helm.
Citing an example of Rohit, Gambhir stated that Dhoni believed in his abilities despite him being in and out of the team and that MSD's backing ultimately led to him becoming one of the best white-ball cricketers in the world.
"The young cricketers in the current generation today, be it Shubman Gill or Sanju Samson, should also get similar kind of support," Gambhir told Sports Tak.
"And now when Rohit is a senior, I expect him to give backing to youngsters. Rohit is a prime example of how a player can become a phenomenal cricketer, if he has good backing.

"One good thing about MS (Dhoni) was that he always kept Rohit in the talks, even if he was not part of the team. He never let him get sidelined," he added.
"I expect Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to groom the youngsters in the same way in which MS Dhoni groomed them."
After making this debut in 2007, Rohit was languishing in the middle-order with consistency being his Achilles heel. Dhoni seemingly took note of Rohit's hidden talent and gave him a long rope. He then promoted Rohit as opener in 2013 and the right-hander hasn't looked back since.

"He (Dhoni) has been like a mentor to me, on and off the field. I can approach him freely with any problem I may be facing, and he will never give me the entire solution for it," Pant said in an Instagram live session with his IPL team Delhi Capitals.

"If Mahi bhai is at the crease, you know things are sorted. He's got a plan in his head, and all you need to do is follow it!"
Dhoni, who has not played competitive cricket since July, was supposed to make a much-awaited comeback with the IPL, which has now been postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh thinks Dhoni has already played his last game for the country.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MS Dhoni is like my mentor, can freely approach him with problems: Rishabh Pant</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New Delhi: Young wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh regards former India captain MS Dhoni as his mentor, whom he can approach freely with his problems.
“He (Dhoni) has been like a mentor to me, on and off the field. I can approach him freely with any problem I may be facing and he will never give me the entire solution for it,” said Pant during a candid chat on Delhi Capitals’ official Instagram handle on Friday.
“This is so that I don’t become entirely dependent on him, he gives me hints only that helps me solve the issue myself. He’s also one of my favourite batting partners, though it’s not something that happens too often.
“If Mahi bhai is at the crease, you know things are sorted. He’s got a plan in his head, and all you need to do is follow it!” he added.
Having idolised Adam Gilchrist and Dhoni all his life, Pant also stressed on the importance of being original. “I feel proud that both of them have acknowledged my performances,” he said. “It’s important to learn from your idols, but you don’t have to copy them. It is important to build your own identity.”
Pant, who hails from Roorkee in Uttarakhand, remembered his days of initial struggle. “I had to travel to Delhi since there wasn’t much cricket in Uttarakhand, and the bus journey was around six hours long. In Delhi, I used to spend the nights in a Gurudwara in Motibagh with my mother,” he said.
“She would help out with the duties in the Gurudwara, and always believed I would get all the blessings for her services in a holy place. Those blessings definitely helped me in my cricketing journey,” he added.
The destructive batsman, who has 1736 IPL runs from 54 matches to his name, also took the opportunity to compare the last two seasons of the tournament for him.
“2018 IPL was a breakthrough year for me, and I got a lot of individual success,” he said.
“But 2019 was more special as Delhi Capitals did so well as a team, and made it to the playoffs after a six year old gap. The team bonding last year was a big reason for our success.
“In a team sport, not everyone is going to have a good day during a match. But we learnt to enjoy and cherish each other’s success, instead of being jealous. In success and failure, we were all there for each other, and that showed in the eventual result – third,” he added.
Pant also had a message for Delhi Capitals fans. He said, “Thank you so much for supporting this team and showering so much love upon us even when we haven’t done well.”
“We owe you an IPL trophy no doubt, and we will do our best to get it for you,” he signed off.

Ponting gives me full freedom at Delhi Capitals: PantRishabh Pant's propensity to go for the jugular at the outset has often led to his downfall, but his IPL franchise Delhi Capitals' coach Ricky Ponting still allows him freedom to do "whatever" he wants to.
"He gives me a free hand. He says do whatever you want to do," Pant said during an Instagram chat with his franchise.
He also called the IPL 2018 season a "life-changing" one for him.
Pant had scored over 650 runs in 14 matches in that IPL at 52.61 and a strike rate of 158.41 with six half centuries.
"That was a life-changing season for me. I needed that breakthrough which everyone needs," he said.
"The core group always thinks of winning IPL for Delhi. We qualified for the knockouts last time and came third."He also spoke about the challenges of playing Test cricket.
"I love playing Tests. You can give yourself time. Mostly you can test yourself in Test cricket. When I was playing four-day first-class games, I had heard it is the real test but when I played five-day cricket... it was like you need to put in that extra effort."The 22-year-old was picked ahead of veteran stumper Wriddhiman Saha in the two Tests which India lost 0-2 in New Zealand.
Recalling his early days of struggle, the Roorkee-born Pant said he used to take a bus at 2 o'clock in the night to travel to Delhi for practice.
"They (Uttarakhand) did not have a cricket team at that point. So I used to take bus at 2 am in the night. That time it used to take six hours by road. It was difficult during winters as it was too cold. There was fog also. It's been a good journey (as I look back).
"At the end of the day, you have to work hard to achieve your goal," said Pant who has played 13 Tests, 16 ODIs and 28 T20Is so far.
Pant said that seniors such as MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan help him a lot along with former stars Yuvraj Singh and Suresh Raina.
Speaking about his idol Adam Gilchrist, Pant said: "Over a period of time I have realised that you have to learn from your idol but you don't have to copy him. You learn things which you like and can implement in life and cricket. You need to have your own identity.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MS Dhoni is like my mentor, can freely approach him with problems: Rishabh Pant</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Young wicketkeeper-batsman Rishabh regards former India captain M.S. Dhoni as his mentor, whom he can approach freely with his problems.
"He (Dhoni) has been like a mentor to me, on and off the field. I can approach him freely with any problem I may be facing and he will never give me the entire solution for it," said Pant during a candid chat on Delhi Capitals' official Instagram handle on Friday.
"This is so that I don't become entirely dependent on him, he gives me hints only that helps me solve the issue myself. He's also one of my favourite batting partners, though it's not something that happens too often.
"If Mahi Bhai is at the crease, you know things are sorted. He's got a plan in his head, and all you need to do is follow it!" he added.
Having idolised Adam Gilchrist and Dhoni all his life, Pant also stressed on the importance of being original. "I feel proud that both of them have acknowledged my performances," he said. "It's important to learn from your idols, but you don't have to copy them. It is important to build your own identity."
Pant, who hails from Roorkee in Uttarakhand, remembered his days of initial struggle. "I had to travel to Delhi since there wasn't much cricket in Uttarakhand, and the bus journey was around six hours long. In Delhi, I used to spend the nights in a Gurudwara in Motibagh with my mother," he said.
"She would help out with the duties in the Gurudwara, and always believed I would get all the blessings for her services in a holy place. Those blessings definitely helped me in my cricketing journey," he added.
The destructive batsman, who has 1736 IPL runs from 54 matches to his name, also took the opportunity to compare the last two seasons of the tournament for him.
"2018 IPL was a breakthrough year for me, and I got a lot of individual success," he said.
"But 2019 was more special as Delhi Capitals did so well as a team, and made it to the playoffs after a six year old gap. The team bonding last year was a big reason for our success.
"In a team sport, not everyone is going to have a good day during a match. But we learnt to enjoy and cherish each other's success, instead of being jealous. In success and failure, we were all there for each other, and that showed in the eventual result  third," he added.
Pant also had a message for Delhi Capitals fans. He said, "Thank you so much for supporting this team and showering so much love upon us even when we haven't done well."
"We owe you an IPL trophy no doubt, and we will do our best to get it for you," he signed off.

    <h5 class="mb-1">When MS Dhoni is on field, everything feels sorted: Rishabh Pant</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rishabh Pant has said that former India skipper and his predecessor MS Dhoni is like a mentor to him and he seeks his guidance, both on and off the field.
MS Dhoni has not played any cricket since India's semi-final exit from the World Cup 2019, following which Pant took over the keeping duties in limited-overs format until KL Rahul emerged as India's new multi-tasker.
In an Instagram live session for Delhi Capitals, Pant revealed that he tries to pick Dhoni's brain.
"He is like a mentor to me. He helps me on and off the field. He gives me hints and tries that I figure things out myself so that I do not become dependent on him but he also does not just back off from it," Pant said during the session.
In recent months, Pant has come under immense scrutiny-both in front of and behind the stumps. The 22-year-old has faced a lot of criticism for his injudicious shots during critical situations during a match. There have also been situations when spectators have chanted Dhoni's name when Pant missed chances on the field.
"Although my favourite batting partner is Mahi Bhai, we get very few chances to bat together. When Mahi Bhai is there, everything feels sorted out as you just have to follow his plan," he said.
"There is Virat, Rohit, whenever you bat alongside seniors, it is a different experience," Pant added.
Though Pant has been under the spotlight since long, the team management and senior players have also backed the wicketkeeper-batsman.
Recently, India opener Rohit Sharma looked unimpressed with how Rishabh Pant's performances in the past have been analyzed by the media.
"I talk to Rishabh Pant more, he is just 20-21, he was under so much of scrutiny that he got tensed."
"Media thinks its part of their job to write but they should be sensible and think before writing something as it plays a huge part," Rohit Sharma said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">You need to put in that extra effort in Test cricket, feels Rishabh Pant</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">His white-ball career might have been a floundering one after making his debut more than three years ago, but in Test cricket, Pant has been able to establish himself as a more than a fair deal. He has two centuries in red-ball cricket, both of them in the away conditions, and now he has become the first-choice wicket-keeper for India when the team travels. It has given him a perspective on looking at things as he spoke about the challenges of playing Test cricket.
"I love playing Tests. You can give yourself time. Mostly you can test yourself in Test cricket. When I was playing four-day first-class games, I had heard it is the real test but when I played five-day cricket...it was like you need to put in that extra effort," Pant said during an Instagram Live chat session with his Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Delhi Capitals' official handle.
Pant hails from Roorkee, a hilly town of Uttarakhand, and used to travel to Delhi every day with his mother to practice with Tarak Sinha at the Sonnet Cricket Club. Uttarakhand didn’t have a team then, which made him play for Rajasthan in the age-group cricket before coming to Delhi. It has been a long journey but a satisfactory one for the Indian wicket-keeper. The Indian keeper also added that alongside all of these efforts, hard work is too crucial to achieving one's goal. 
"They (Uttarakhand) did not have a cricket team at that point. So I used to take the bus at 2 am in the night. That time it used to take 6 hours by road. It was difficult during winters as it was too cold. There was fog also. It's been a good journey (as I look back). At the end of the day, you have to work hard to achieve your goal," Pant revealed.

Philippe Coutinho will only join Newcastle if the Premier League club appoints Mauricio Pochettino as manager, reports in Spain claim.
The Saint James' Park outfit are on the edge of a £300m takeover from a consortium led by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund at the end of April.

Coutinho is currently one of the hottest players in the transfer market after failing to justify his £142million move from Liverpool to Barcelona in 2018.
The Brazilian is presently on a season-long loan move to Bayern Munich despite his nine goals and nine assists, the Bavarians are unwilling to make his deal permanent.
Barcelona are looking to offload Coutinho off their books in the summer and Chelsea are the club leading the race for the Inter Milan star.
But Newcastle are the latest club to have penned their interest in the Brazilian and the only hurdle of landing Coutinho at the club is hiring Pochettino.
Reports claim that Barca have reportedly placed around £80m price tag on Coutinho which Chelsea are not prepared to meet.
Coutinho managed 21 goals and 11 assists in 76 matches for Barca, against his 54 goals in 201 appearances for Liverpool.

Arsenal, Manchester United and Tottenham have also been linked to him, but Liverpool have rejected the chance to take him back.
According to Spanish news outlet Mundo Deportivo, the 27-year-old will only be priced away from Camp Nou for £87m.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Magpies could soon become comfortably the richest side in English football as a Saudi consortium attempt to buy the club from owner Mike Ashley.
Pochettino, who left Tottenham Hotspur in the latter stages of 2019, has been linked with a move to St James' Park as a possible replacement for Steve Bruce.
Coutinho, meanwhile, is also thought to be a target for Newcastle, and according to Mundo Deportivo, the Brazil international could arrive at the club if Pochettino is appointed as head coach.
Barcelona are reportedly ready to sell the 27-year-old, who has spent the 2019-20 campaign on loan at Bayern Munich, contributing nine goals and eight assists in 32 outings for the German champions.
Chelsea, Manchester United and Everton have also been linked with the South American, though, as talk of a return to English football continues to gather pace.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Philippe Coutinho's Premier League return could hinge on Mauricio Pochettino decision</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Philippe Coutinho's hopes of a return to the Premier League may rely on whether Mauricio Pochettino takes over at Newcastle United under prospective new owners.
Current Magpies owner Mike Ashley is set to sell the club amid heavy interest from Saudi and American parties, both of whom have made the former Tottenham Hotspur coach their priority managerial target.
Meanwhile, Coutinho looks destined to leave Camp Nou this summer after spending this season on loan with Bayern Munich.
The Brazilian playmaker's agent said last month that his client "would love" a return to the Premier League, escalating speculation linking Coutinho with a move to Chelsea.
However, the Blues are unwilling to meet Barcelona's £87m asking price for the 27-year-old and Newcastle have emerged as a suitor thanks to Pochettino's admiration for the former Liverpool man.
Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo report that a previous approach for Coutinho by Pochettino was blocked by Spurs chairman Daniel Levy and that the Argentinian coach could swoop again.
"Pochettino already tried last summer to sign Coutinho for Tottenham and if he did not succeed it was because of President Levy's irreparable enmity with the Brazilian's agent," the report claims.
"Now, without personal issues involved, Coutinho could reach a club for which, in recent months, [Antoine] Griezmann has also sounded."
A marquee signing of Coutinho or Griezmann at St James' Park would be a statement of intent for a Newcastle under new ownership.
The report adds that Pochettino "would become the leader of a project, such as the one in which Manchester City began, and who wants to place Newcastle in the super elite of football".
Pochettino is currently odds-on favourite to take over at Newcastle from current manager Steve Bruce. The Magpies are currently 13th in the Premier League and have scored just 25 goals in 29 games this season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">England's Jason Roy would accept cricket's return without fans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">London – England opener Jason Roy is desperate to get back to playing cricket, even if matches have to take place behind closed doors due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Roy, who was part of England's World Cup-winning team last year, had a taste of playing in an empty stadium in the Pakistan Super League earlier this year and said it was a bizarre experience.
"No atmosphere," said the 29-year-old. "Simple as that, to be honest. It was a very strange feeling.
"You're used to, as a batsman, with the bowler running in, it being relatively quiet. You learn to block out the crowd but then as soon as that ball's done you hear the crowd going absolutely berserk and over there when that was the case it was dead silence, it was the strangest thing."
The PSL, a Twenty20 competition, closed its doors to spectators in March before suspending the competition days later due to coronavirus.
Despite that experience, Roy, a destructive opening batsman, wants to get back to playing, with the start of the English season delayed until July 1 at the earliest.
"I'm more than happy to play behind closed doors," he said. "I think it would be nice just to get out there."
The Surrey player said the British government's lockdown meant he was severely limited in his ability to practice.
"I'm shadow-batting in the mirror, I'm looking pretty good," he joked. "So that's all I can do, to be honest, hitting a tennis ball against my wall here at home, going a bit stir crazy."
Roy said the ongoing disruption meant it could make sense to postpone the T20 World Cup, scheduled for Australia in October, but he said the players would make sure they were ready if it went ahead.
He said he was happy to start playing again when asked to by his bosses because he trusted their judgment, describing himself as a "pawn in the sporting world."
Roy was asked about comments made by Barcelona footballer Ivan Rakitic, who told the Spanish press he was ready to take the risk of returning to action despite the virus.
Roy said: "If an individual wants to go onto the front line and put himself at risk then good on him but if someone doesn't want to, then I don't think they should be ashamed of it either.
"Whatever's right in that situation. If the country desperately needs us to play cricket to make themselves feel better… but I'm not sure that's the case."
Meanwhile, the Daily Telegraph reported that England could begin its rescheduled three-Test series against the West Indies on July 8.
The series was originally due to start on June 4 at the Oval. However, the spread of the coronavirus scuppered those plans.
England captain Joe Root and his West Indies counterpart Jason Holder have now been involved in talks over rescheduling.
"Positive ongoing discussions with the ECB and CWI continued on Friday," a spokesperson for the England and Wales Cricket Board said.
"Both boards were represented including captains, coaches, administrators and the chief medical officers from the respective boards.
"Discussions were wide-ranging including dialogue around revised schedules and COVID-19 medical and biosecurity planning.
"Meetings will be ongoing over the next few months to reach an outcome of when international cricket could potentially return."

    <h5 class="mb-1">England’s ‘stir-crazy’ Jason Roy happy to play behind closed doors</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England’s Jason Roy is ready to play in empty stadiums if the post-coronavirus situation demands so, said the opener who got a taste of it in his last outing.
Roy played a Pakistan Super League match on May 7 which took place behind closed doors in Lahore just before the pandemic halted international sports across the globe.
“There was no atmosphere, simple as that,” the Durban-born batsman, a key figure in England’s World Cup-winning squad last year, told British media.
“It was very strange. As a batsman when the bowler’s running in you learn to block out the crowd, but as soon as the ball is done you can hear them going absolutely berserk.
“(In Lahore) there was just dead silence. You could hear your mate calling ones and twos, so you don’t just have to work off each other’s body language. It was hard to get up for it. But it was something we knew we had to deal with.”
Playing without fans has been suggested as one possible way to resume cricket as soon as the pandemic subsides and Roy was ready to adjust.
“I’m more than happy to play behind closed doors. It would just be nice to get out there. I feel like a kid again,” he said, adding he was “going a bit stir crazy” in the shutdown.
The global health crisis and the restrictions it has forced have clouded the outlook for this year’s Twenty20 World Cup scheduled in Australia.
“If players aren’t able to prepare in the right way and are unable to get over to Australia, then it makes sense to postpone it,” Roy said of the tournament scheduled in October-November.
“But if it goes ahead and we’re told we have three weeks to prepare all the boys will be putting in the hard yards to make sure we’re ready.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India opener Rohit Sharma on Saturday said that he is badly missing hitting the ball amid the coronavirus lockdown and can't wait to go out and enjoy the game.
Cricket like many other sports has been hit hard by the novel coronavirus as almost all leagues and series have either been cancelled or postponed due to the health crisis.
Rohit Sharma, who is the captain of Mumbai Indians, is currently in isolation with his wife and daughter in his flat in Mumbai and wished he had enough place to play indoor cricket.
"I wish I had enough place to play indoor cricket, but unfortunately in Mumbai, the place is very secluded, and you have to stick to your apartment. We are not lucky as you guys where you have your own backyard to play," Rohit said while speaking to former Australian pacer Brett Lee on Star Sports Cricket Connected show.
"In Mumbai, it's very expensive to get your own house where you have your own backyard. I live in an apartment and I am lucky to have a little balcony where I can run around and do some activities that my trainer has given me.
Rohit Sharma, who turned 33 on Thursday, said he is trying to maintain his fitness in the little space he has and hopes that the gyms will open soon.
"I am trying to follow whatever little I can. Hopefully, the gyms will open soon, and I can go there," he added.
"But I am missing hitting the ball, that's for sure. As you know, I like to hit big, so the space is not enough. I just can't wait to go out there and start hitting the ball," Rohit said.

“I am trying to follow whatever little I can. Hopefully, the gyms will open soon, and I can go there,” he added.
“But I am missing hitting the ball, that’s for sure. As you know, I like to hit big, so the space is not enough. I just can’t wait to go out there and start hitting the ball,” Rohit, who recently turned 33, further said.
All sporting activities have been suspended since mid March following the coronavirus outbreak which has so far claimed more than 2.3 lakh lives across the world. And the chances of cricketing activities resuming in the near future are highly grim.
In India, nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24. It was first slated to end on April 14 but then it was extended till May 3. It has now been further extended till May 17 as the increase in the number of COVID-19 cases refuses to slow down.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Arsenal warned that Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang 'could walk out the door'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arsenal should be wary of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang "walking out the door".
The Gunners frontman is entering the final 12 months of his deal at the Emirates.
Since arriving from Borussia Dortmund in January 2018 he has become crucial to the north London outfit.
But with Arsenal someway off challenging for trophies former captain Tony Adams fears Aubameyang could take his talents elsewhere with Chelsea and Barcelona among those interested.
“Quite possibly, he could walk out the door,” Adams told Sky Sports.
“I loved [former manager] Arsene Wenger's principles, that no player was bigger than the club, and he moved players on if it made sense for the club financially.
“He was strong with that and he got Champions League football every year but it did stand in the way of recruitment - so we have become a club that is selling the best players.
“If I was a coach I'd be saying: ‘Don't sell Aubameyang at any price, we need to recruit, bring players through the academy and keep our best players.’”
Adams won the league title on four occasions during his Arsenal career as well as the FA Cup and League Cup.

He revealed that Manchester United made a move for him, before he was given assurances that the Gunners would remain competitive due to their recruitment.
But he claims Arsenal's recent transfer policy has "not been great" and will make it impossible to win the title.
He added: “Alex Ferguson came in for me but I wouldn't leave and I said to the chairman: ‘Have we got ambition at the club?'
“He said: ‘Don't worry, we are injecting a lot of money and we are going to go for it.’
“I stayed and the rest is history - Dennis Bergkamp came and Nicolas Anelka, Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit, Robert Pires - we had five World Cup winners in the team.
“It is a completely different club today and I think recruitment at Arsenal for a good few years has not been great.
“Now we seem to be selling our best players and you are never going to recruit a championship squad selling all your best players.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tony Adams sends warning to Arsenal over Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang transfer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tony Adams says Arsenal’s history of selling their top players may mean star striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang will ‘walk out the door’ this summer.
The Gabon international has just one year remaining on his current deal at the Emirates Stadium, prompting interest from Chelsea, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Barcelona.
The Gunners’ inability to challenge for league titles over the last decade, allied to their delicate financial situation, has seen them lose world-class talents such as Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie.
And club legend Adams fears the same may happen with Aubameyang, telling Sky Sports: ‘Quite possibly, he could walk out the door.
‘I loved [former manager] Arsene Wenger’s principles, that no player was bigger than the club, and he moved players on if it made sense for the club financially.
‘He was strong with that and he got Champions League football every year but it did stand in the way of recruitment – so we have become a club that is selling the best players.
‘If I was a coach I’d be saying, “Don’t sell Aubameyang at any price, we need to recruit, bring players through the academy and keep our best players”.’
Adams, who won 10 major trophies at Arsenal in three different decades, says the recruitment policy at the club now is nowhere near as successful as it used to be when he was at Highbury.
He added: ‘They bang on about the class of ’92 [at Manchester United] – in our class of ’83 we had six internationals in our youth team – Niall Quinn, Paul Merson, Michael Thomas, Rocky [David Rocastle], me and Martin [Keown].
‘But put that on top of [board member] Danny Fiszman putting a lot of money into the club in ’95, ’96 and we were getting world class players come to Arsenal football club.
‘[Manchester United manager] Alex Ferguson came in for me but I wouldn’t leave and I said to the chairman ‘have we got ambition at the club?’
‘He said, “Don’t worry, we are injecting a lot of money and we are going to go for it”.
‘I stayed and the rest is history – Dennis [Bergkamp] came and Nicolas Anelka, [Patrick] Vieira, Manu [Emmanuel Petit], Robert Pires – we had five World Cup winners in the team.’
‘It is a completely different club today and I think recruitment at Arsenal for a good few years has not been great.
‘Now we seem to be selling our best players and you are never going to recruit a championship squad selling all your best players.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tony Adams wouldn't sell Aubameyang for "any price"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Arsenal legend Tony Adams has hit out at the club's policy of selling their best players and fears they're set to lose Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang this summer.
The Gabon striker is out of contract in 2021 and is being linked with a move away from the Emirates, with Inter Milan and Barcelona both reportedly interested in the 29-year-old.
Adams says he wouldn't sell the former Borussia Dortmund attacker at "any price" but fears the Gunners are about to lose another big name:
"Quite possibly, he could walk out the door", the double winning skipper told Sky Sports News.
"I loved Arsene Wenger's principles, that no player was bigger than the club, and he moved players on if it made sense for the club financially.
"He was strong with that and he got Champions League football every year but it did stand in the way of recruitment - so we have become a club that is selling the best players.
"If I was a coach I'd be saying 'don't sell Aubameyang at any price, we need to recruit, bring players through the academy and keep our best players'.
"I think recruitment at Arsenal for a good few years has not been great.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sanitised balls, players in facemasks: How coronavirus may change cricket</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The lockdown due to the coronavirus has had a major effect on the sports lovers across the world. One never imagined life without following a live sporting event and for Indians, "Cricket".
The month of April had become synonymous with the most popular league in cricket, the Indian Premier League (IPL). Apart from cricketers, the IPL had a phenomenal following all over the cricketing world. It was the centre stage of entertainment in most Indian homes when the live action on the field overcame the scripted production of the tinsel world.
The 13th edition of the IPL, one still feels, will get a window by the end of this year as the stakes involved for all concerned are too high for it to be shelved without a ball being bowled.
The uncertainty of the spread of the Covid-19 epidemic and the unavailability of the vaccine has made prediction impossible as to when cricket may see the light of day. The famous phrase of the entertainment world comes to ones' mind, "the show must go on".
One does realise the precarious situation that one is facing presently and with a complete lockdown of interaction between individuals, travel and transport the start of any cricket looks a far off probability.
The after effects of the virus, when things are back to normal, if and when it happens, does ignite some interesting thoughts.
One such topic that is being discussed extensively is the use of saliva and sweat on the cricket ball. 
ALSO READ: Covid-19: Australia bans use of saliva as sports activities set to return
The saliva was one area as a sportsman that I personally detested. There were times, fielding close to the wicket, when I had to talk to the batsman to stop spitting and polluting the ground, where I was fielding. One did witness players freely spitting while playing football but the elite game of cricket had a different aura and class to it.
Presently, one is disgusted to see so many cricketers spewing their saliva at any given moment. One hopes that the laws of spitting and the fines for doing so are seriously implemented henceforth.
The other popular area of using saliva is by applying it on the cricket ball to keep one side of it shining. This, one is given to understand, helps bowlers to reverse swing as well as to swing the ball the conventional way. Unfortunately, one forgets that to master this skill one requires immense practice and many hours of hard-work.
In India, and many other countries, sweat is used more frequently than saliva to shine the ball. The saliva only plays a part when players need to mix it with some juicy ingredients from the mouth. A hair full of oil, lip balm and vaseline was enough to shine the ball when mixed with sweat. Oily hair is still very much a part and parcel of the game and has somehow escaped the regulators.
In the future, one will need to ensure safety and the only way this would be possible would be through the use of hand sanitisers. The umpire will need to monitor this and so rather than allowing any other material, the sanitiser usage on the ball after every over could be a good way to keep one sanitised and safe. This will also take care of the major issue that a bowler may face and that is to keep one side of the ball suitably polished.
During one of our Ranji Trophy matches many moons ago, one of our fielders had a handkerchief covering his nose and mouth. His explanation was that he was allergic to dust. We all had a hearty laugh, especially, as we were in the dusty bowl of India. Lo and behold, he was quickly branded as a "Bandit".
We now take our thoughts to the possible scenario once cricket resumes, when every player and umpire look like bandits with a face mask (another money making brand endorsement opportunity). We did get a glimpse of cricket stars in various shades, shapes and styles of face masks that could become fashionable in a short film being shown on the prevention of the COVID-19 virus. A muffed appeal will be quite a hilarious sight. The hugging and high fives, unfortunately for the cricketers, will be a thing of the past.
As regards the batsman, he/she will have one extra accessory and that could be a high end face mask with a facility to hear or shout out a call through the helmet. The area where all the fielders will be happy about would be the gloves. This will make catching far simpler and one that will also protect an area one is always careful about and that is the fingers.
Cricket viewership in India at the stadium would only be affected during the limited overs international matches. The Indian domestic matches are barely viewed by spectators and even the domestic limited overs games are played with sparsely filled stands.
The Test matches also do not have an unmanageable crowd and apart from the limited overs internationals, cricket on the ground will not have a major impact where spectator viewing is concerned.
One factor for sure is that life and cricket post Covid-19 will never be the same again. But, cricket in any form is much better than none at all. One does miss watching the beautiful game called cricket, even though one may see 22 colourful branded face masked bandits on the field.

    <h5 class="mb-1">A look at the sport cricket post COVID-19</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The lockdown due to the coronavirus has had a major effect on the sports lovers across the world. One never imagined life without following a live sporting event and for Indians, “Cricket”.
The month of April had become synonymous with the most popular league in cricket, the Indian Premier League (IPL). Apart from cricketers, the IPL had a phenomenal following all over the cricketing world. It was the centre stage of entertainment in most Indian homes when the live action on the field overcame the scripted production of the tinsel world.
The 13th edition of the IPL, one still feels, will get a window by the end of this year as the stakes involved for all concerned are too high for it to be shelved without a ball being bowled.
The uncertainty of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic and the unavailability of the vaccine has made prediction impossible as to when cricket may see the light of day. The famous phrase of the entertainment world comes to ones’ mind, “the show must go on”.
One does realise the precarious situation that one is facing presently and with a complete lockdown of interaction between individuals, travel and transport the start of any cricket looks a far off probability.
The after effects of the virus, when things are back to normal, if and when it happens, does ignite some interesting thoughts.
One such topic that is being discussed extensively is the use of saliva and sweat on the cricket ball.
The saliva was one area as a sportsman that I personally detested. There were times, fielding close to the wicket, when I had to talk to the batsman to stop spitting and polluting the ground, where I was fielding. One did witness players freely spitting while playing football but the elite game of cricket had a different aura and class to it.
Presently, one is disgusted to see so many cricketers spewing their saliva at any given moment. One hopes that the laws of spitting and the fines for doing so are seriously implemented henceforth.
The other popular area of using saliva is by applying it on the cricket ball to keep one side of it shining. This, one is given to understand, helps bowlers to reverse swing as well as to swing the ball the conventional way. Unfortunately, one forgets that to master this skill one requires immense practice and many hours of hard-work.
In India, and many other countries, sweat is used more frequently than saliva to shine the ball. The saliva only plays a part when players need to mix it with some juicy ingredients from the mouth. A hair full of oil, lip balm and vaseline was enough to shine the ball when mixed with sweat. Oily hair is still very much a part and parcel of the game and has somehow escaped the regulators.
In the future, one will need to ensure safety and the only way this would be possible would be through the use of hand sanitisers. The umpire will need to monitor this and so rather than allowing any other material, the sanitiser usage on the ball after every over could be a good way to keep one sanitised and safe. This will also take care of the major issue that a bowler may face and that is to keep one side of the ball suitably polished.
During one of our Ranji Trophy matches many moons ago, one of our fielders had a handkerchief covering his nose and mouth. His explanation was that he was allergic to dust. We all had a hearty laugh, especially, as we were in the dusty bowl of India. Lo and behold, he was quickly branded as a “Bandit”.
We now take our thoughts to the possible scenario once cricket resumes, when every player and umpire look like bandits with a face mask (another money making brand endorsement opportunity). We did get a glimpse of cricket stars in various shades, shapes and styles of face masks that could become fashionable in a short film being shown on the prevention of the COVID-19 virus. A muffed appeal will be quite a hilarious sight. The hugging and high fives, unfortunately for the cricketers, will be a thing of the past.
As regards the batsman, he/she will have one extra accessory and that could be a high end face mask with a facility to hear or shout out a call through the helmet. The area where all the fielders will be happy about would be the gloves. This will make catching far simpler and one that will also protect an area one is always careful about and that is the fingers.
Cricket viewership in India at the stadium would only be affected during the limited overs international matches. The Indian domestic matches are barely viewed by spectators and even the domestic limited overs games are played with sparsely filled stands.
The Test matches also do not have an unmanageable crowd and apart from the limited overs internationals, cricket on the ground will not have a major impact where spectator viewing is concerned.
One factor for sure is that life and cricket post COVID-19 will never be the same again. But, cricket in any form is much better than none at all. One does miss watching the beautiful game called cricket, even though one may see 22 colourful branded face masked bandits on the field.

    <h5 class="mb-1">60% fans think IPL 2020 will take place this year</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">With the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the world, a deafening silence haunts the stadiums, fields and other gaming arenas. While the clouds of uncertainty hover around the return of sports, mainly the Indian Premier League (IPL), the authorities remain concerned about the return of sports enthusiasts to the venues.
A first of its kind survey conducted over by MyTeam11, the second-largest Fantasy Sports brand of India, helped understand the mindset of sports enthusiasts & how is it going to affect the industry as a whole in the future.
The sports industry in India is spread wide & far, cricket being the preference with about 81% votes while football & other sports share a similar level of popularity at 9% each. Here’s how people reacted towards the poll.
Sports might resume soon, but venues can remain empty for a longer period
83% of the poll takers pitched in to say that sports might get rolling again by the end of the year 2020 while nearly 40% will not feel comfortable attending sports events anytime before the year 2021. The pandemic has affected people greatly & people are unwilling to put their safety at stake.
All the tournaments across the world have come to a standstill. The 2020 season of the world’s major sporting event, Tokyo Olympics, was also postponed until next year. On the other hand, there’s still no clarity about the organization of the cash-rich tournament, celebrated as a festival of cricket, IPL. The 13th edition of the tournament was set to begin on March 29, but with nationwide lockdown, it has been postponed indefinitely.
Meanwhile, there are two windows available for the organization of the IPL, nearly 40% of the poll takers believe that it might not happen this year. On the other hand, 13% of the people believe that IPL 2020 should be organized in empty stadiums during the June-July window.
Sports & fantasy gaming
Where at one hand 63% of the sports fraternity is eagerly waiting for sports and, in particular, the IPL to resume soon, 20% of the people are okay even if it resumes in 3-4 months.This is mainly because sports serves as the biggest entertainer & stress-buster for the majority of people.
Moreover, fantasy sports gaming has been witnessing a sky-rocketing populating with nearly 80% of the poo-takers being active fantasy sports players. The sudden lockdown on sports has dramatically affected the fantasy sports market as there are only a few tournaments available.
Future trends
The sports fans are eagerly waiting for things to normalize & watch sports taking the field once again. Looking at the current situations & expectations of people, it can be derived that we might soon be able to enjoy games on our televisions, mobile phones or other streaming platforms. However, we’ll have to wait for quite sometime to hear those cheers at the venues.
Key comments from the curators of the survey
Speaking about the objective behind the survey, MyTeam11, COO and Co-Founder, Sanjit Sihag said, “We are a sports loving country and fans being one of the most important units it was important to know how they are thinking and reacting to the situation because without them there are no takers for sport.”
He also commented on the takeaways and said, “The survey proved two important points that people want sport to be back real soon but don’t want to quit being prudent and are fine with just enjoying the sport from safe distance or on their gadgets. Secondly, the Fantasy gaming industry has seen a slump but can also see a sharp revival trend as soon as sports resumes based on the ever increasing number of fantasy sports lovers.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">MLS to allow individual workouts on team training fields</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Major League Soccer is allowing players to return to outdoor team training fields for individual workouts starting Wednesday.
MLS suspended the season because of the coronavirus pandemic on March 12, closing all team facilities but asking players to remain in market with their teams. The league-wide moratorium on group and team training remains in effect through May 15.
REAL SALT LAKE'S GIUSEPPE ROSSI OPTIMISTIC MLS WILL BE ABLE TO RECOVER MOST, IF NOT ALL, OF THE SEASON
MLS says the individual workouts must follow certain health and safety protocols as well as local public health and government policies. The workouts are voluntary.
Sporting Kansas City coach Peter Vermes advocated for the new policy out of concern for player safety. Players who work out in public spaces run the risk of being recognized and possibly having contact with others.
“What we have suggested all along is that by providing private field access, which we have available to us because we all have our own facilities, you could just do individual workouts. That’s not where a coach is out there training the player, or coaches training a team,” Vermes said. "It’s just providing private field space that still keeps the players socially distanced, and the ability to do it in a safe manner.”
MLS teams must submit a specific plan for training protocols before players are allowed to start workouts. They will include restricting facilities to essential staff, sanitizing and disinfection of all equipment after each session, screening measures including temperature checks, and staggered player and staff arrivals and departures, as well as designated parking that ensures proper distancing.
Players are still not allowed access to indoor facilities, such as locker rooms.
PANDEMIC PUTS ADDITIONAL STRAIN ON INTERNATIONAL MLS PLAYERS 
Players must wear personal protective equipment upon arriving and departing from the fields, while staff will be required to use such equipment — masks and gloves — at all times. Staff must also maintain a distance of 10 feet from players at all times.
Practice fields can be divided into four quadrants, allowing multiple players to train, but only under guidelines that restrict contact and ensure social distancing.
“This is individual workouts with private field access only,” Vermes said. “If you think of it that way, you’re thinking of it based on putting the player safety first. And again, this is a much safer environment than the alternatives they have.”
The next phase would be small group workouts, but there is no timetable for that because of the fluid situation surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and the policies in different communities.
But the move is a first step toward a return for MLS. NASCAR is bringing back live racing at Darlington Raceway on May 17 without fans in attendance. UFC will host the first of three shows without fans in Jacksonville, Florida, starting on May 9.

Individual MLS team plans for solo training must be approved by medical staffs and a local infectious disease expert, and must be submitted to MLS and communicated to players.
Teams must also have emergency plans in place for any coronavirus-related issues that might come up, including players who become ill.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MLS allows individual workouts to resume from Wednesday</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK: Major League Soccer (MLS) players can begin voluntary individual workouts on team's outdoor training fields starting from Wednesday under coronavirus health protocols where government shutdown laws permit, the league announced on Friday.
The move marks the first small step toward resuming the 2020 MLS season, which was halted after only two weeks due to the deadly virus outbreak.
A league-wide moratorium on small-group and full-team training sessions remains in place through May 15.
The MLS move comes after the NBA announced it would allow players to conduct solo workouts at team facilities starting next Friday where allowed under stay-at-home laws.

Up to four MLS players may train on the field at once, with the area divided into four quadrants and players limited to their zone with no passing or shooting between zones allowed.
Having players use team-operated fields allows clubs to control the environment, ensuring all involved adhere to social distance and safety protocols created by MLS with medical and disease experts.
Workout protocols do not allow access to other team facilities such as gyms, locker rooms and training rooms, except as permitted for players recovering from surgery or injury.
Teams must restrict access to essential personnel only, sanitize all training spaces and such equipment as balls, cones or goals between each workout session and check each player's temperature upon his arrival at the facility.
Teams must stagger player and staff arrivals and departures and designate parking spaces to maintain maximum distance between vehicles, with players required to use personal protective equipment in traveling to and from the field from parking lots.
Staff members must use protective equipment and stay at least 10 feet from players at all times with hand washing and disinfectant stations required to be used before and after all workouts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">MLS to allow individual player workouts beginning May 6</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MLS players can begin individual workouts at team training fields beginningMay 6, provided theycomply with comprehensive safety protocols set out by medical and infectious disease experts, the league has announced.
Only two rounds of matches were played in MLS before it was suspendedMarch 12 as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
It was hoped originally that action could resume by May 10, but last month MLS said it may have to play a shortened scheduled.
While it remains unclear when play will begin again, MLS released a statementFriday confirming a step forward in a return to training, with all workouts on a voluntary basis.
"By allowing players, on a voluntary basis, to utilize team-operated fields for individual workouts, MLS clubs will be able to provide a controlled environment that ensures adherence to safety protocols and social distancing measures for players and staff," the league said in the statement.
"The individual player workout protocol prohibits access to club facilities including but not limited to locker rooms, team gyms, and team training rooms. Team gyms and training rooms may still only be accessed by players receiving post-operative and rehabilitation treatment, as directed by the club's chief medical officer.
"The leaguewide moratorium on small group and full team training remains in place through, and including, Friday, May 15."
The statement said every team must submit a club-specific plan detailing how they plan to adhere to health and safety protocols.
The criteria included the restriction of training facility access to essential staff only, plans for sanitization and disinfection of equipment, a screening assessment for each player prior to arrival and temperature checks at the facility.
It added there should be staggered player and staff arrivals and departures with each having designated parking spaces. Furthermore, personal protective equipment (PPE) should be used from parking lots to the field, while staff should use PPE through training and keep a distance of 10 feet from players.
Clubs can use outdoor training facilities, with each field divided into a maximum of four quadrants and only one player per quadrant able to participate per session.
All teams must create an emergency action plan for all COVID-19 related issues, which is to be approved by the club's medical staff and local disease experts before being submitted to MLS.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brown: Surreal to play again</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dustin Brown says it was “a little surreal” to make a return to playing tennis in the Tennis Point Exhibition Series.
The sport has been on a hiatus since the start of March due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the ATP and WTA Tours are only expected to return on 13 July.
However, exhibition tennis made a return on Friday with the Exo Tennis Series in Germany and Brown is the highest-profile player in the eight-player tournament.
It is a closed doors event without any spectators, line judges and ball kids while there are also no handshakes before or after matches.
“It’s nice to finally play, it’s a little surreal to be honest, with everything that is actually going on in the world,” he told Tennis Channel.
“With all the safety guidelines I think everyone has done pretty well, doing their best. Even sometimes when it’s not that easy. Very happy to be out here and have some fun.”
The indoor clay-court event, which is being streamed by the Tennis Channel, is played over a short format as it is first to four games with no advantage scoring.
Former world No 64 Brown helped to plan the format along with Base Tennis owner Rodney Rapson.
“There is not that much pressure,” Brown said. “It’s hard to get up and train when you don’t know when you can play so this event has definitely helped the mindset for the last couple of weeks, knowing something might happen.
“It’s been a little light at the end of the tunnel.”
The tournament will come to a conclusion on Monday with the playoffs before the next Exo Tennis event kicks off on 7 May.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Feels surreal to be back on court: German tennis player Dustin Brown</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tennis player Dustin Brown said returning to competitive action at the Tennis Point Exhibition Series in Germany this week amid the coronavirus pandemic was a surreal experience.
The German, who famously beat Rafael Nadal at Wimbledon in 2015, is the highest-profile player in the eight-man field at the event being held at the Base Tennis centre near Koblenz.
The ATP and WTA Tours remain suspended until mid-July at the earliest, but the event in Brown’s home country, the first of three that will form the Exo Tennis Series, has at least offered the chance of some competitive action.
“It’s nice to finally play, it’s a little surreal to be honest, with everything that is actually going on in the world,” former world No. 64 said, after winning his opening two round-robin matches on Friday (May 1).
“With all the safety guidelines, I think everyone has done pretty well, doing their best. Even sometimes when it’s not that easy. Very happy to be out here and have some fun.”
The event is taking place without spectators, line judges and ball kids and there are no handshakes after the match.
Players arrive alone and have their own designated space in the venue to prepare. Once on court, they sit at opposite sides during the changeovers. The event continues until Monday.
Matches on the indoor claycourt are played over a short format, first to four games and no advantage scoring.
Brown, speaking to the Tennis Channel who are streaming the action live, said in some respects it was a little easier.
“There is not that much pressure,” the 35-year-old, who helped devise the format with Base Tennis owner Rodney Rapson, said.
“It’s hard to get up and train when you don’t know when you can play, so this event has definitely helped the mindset for the last couple of weeks, knowing something might happen.
“It’s been a little light at the end of the tunnel.”
Brown, who missed the second half of last year because of injury and slipped to 239th in the world, is back on court on Saturday when he will face Britain’s Jan Choinski.
After the conclusion of the eight-man round-robin group, a series of play-offs will be contested on Monday to decide the standings. The next Exo Tennis event starts on May 7. – REUTERS

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Premier League can overcome restart challenges’</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON: West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady insists that every Premier League club wants to complete the season despite there being “a lot of obstacles” to restarting the campaign.
Clubs were presented with the league’s “Project Restart” plans at a meeting on Friday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-2020 season must be played at neutral venues.
That is an extra sticking point to a litany of other logistical issues as there remains opposition on sporting integrity grounds about the idea of not finishing the campaign on a home-and-away basis.
“At yesterday’s meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart,” said Brady in her column for the Sun newspaper.
“The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game.
“Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again.
“There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said on Thursday that the idea of not playing matches home and away was a “further imperfection” on top of games being behind closed doors.
Before plans to return to playing can progress, the Premier League clubs must also address the thorny issues of testing and player welfare.
Players, coaches and backroom staff would reportedly be tested two or three times a week and could be forced to quarantine in hotels away from their families to help prevent the spread of the virus.
The Bundesliga’s ambitious plans to return to playing matches this month were dealt a blow with the news on Friday that three people at Cologne have tested positive for coronavirus and been placed in a 14-day quarantine.
Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero admitted this week that players are “scared” at the prospect of being rushed back into action, while Brighton’s Glenn Murray questioned whether it is right for football’s return to drain resources from public services such as ambulance crews and police.
The proposal of neutral venues by the Premier League is designed to reduce the number of medical, security and broadcast personnel needed at every match.
“It’s clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the Government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority,” added Brady.
“They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brighton, West Ham raise doubts about neutral venues for Premier League</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Brighton has become the first English Premier League club to publicly oppose plans to try to restart the season in neutral stadiums during the coronavirus pandemic.
As the COVID-19 death toll surpassed 28,000 in Britain, Brighton chief executive Paul Barber accepted that resuming sporting events would require compromises but said Saturday that the league's integrity would be damaged if teams couldn't play at home.
West Ham vice chair Karren Brady said "no one wants" neutral stadiums but was not as direct in her opposition to the league's "Project Restart" plan, given the need for authorities to approve venues.
The Premier League sees using only up to half of the 20 stadiums as the most viable way of completing the season, which was suspended almost two months ago.

Police also have backed teams not playing at home, even with no fans present, to prevent them from gathering outside the stadiums. Supporters are likely to be prevented from attending sporting events for many months in Britain to limit the spread of COVID-19 infections.
The Premier League, which held a conference call with all clubs on Friday, hopes team training sessions can resume within weeks but games are not likely to be played for at least another month.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises," Barber said, "and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government's efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition."
Barber said Brighton had not been approached about using its Amex Stadium, which is more isolated than the likes of Anfield, which is surrounded by rows of tightly packed houses in Liverpool. West Ham also has a venue that fans can be kept away from as it sits on the Olympic Park used for the 2012 Games.
The government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority would have to approve the locations of games during the pandemic.
"They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance," Brady said. "But like everything else, nothing has been agreed."
West Ham and Brighton are in a scrap to avoid relegation with nine games remaining. Brighton is two points and three places above the drop zone. West Ham is only out of danger due to a superior goal difference.
Barber highlighted how four of Brighton's five remaining home games are against some of Europe's biggest clubs: Arsenal, Manchester United, leader Liverpool and defending champion Manchester City.
"The disadvantages of us not playing the league's top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious," Barber said.
"Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn't equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn't play our first 29 matches of the season in this way. So, in our opinion one thing doesn't cancel out the other."
Britain's national lockdown currently runs through Thursday, with the league waiting to see how restrictions will be eased and whether the competition can restart now the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak has passed.
Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, whose responsibilities include sport, said after talks with leagues on Friday that he was working on plans that deliver for Britons who "desperately want sport back on."
But Brighton striker Glenn Murray has expressed reservations about playing again soon given the risks of players spreading the coronavirus.
"I understand the public is desperate to get football back, but it is us that are going to be going out there and competing against other teams," Murray said. "Everyone is in different situations, I have children at home, I wouldn't want to jeopardize them, some footballers have newly born children who might be more susceptible to getting the disease. Some are living with elderly parents. It is a really difficult situation to agree on."
Isolated sessions at training grounds started last week at some clubs, including Brighton, for players to do individual fitness work. Phase two of the restart plan envisages group training be allowed again, then approval would be required for the restart of domestic fixtures.
"The only common theme from all the clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game," Brady wrote in Saturday's editions of 'The Sun' newspaper. "There is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again. There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make."
Liverpool has a 25-point lead with nine games left.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Legal action fears if Prem doesn't finish</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">English Premier League clubs opposed to resuming the season in empty, neutral stadiums were urged by the Crystal Palace chairman on Sunday to accept the plans or the “game might never fully recover.”
Steve Parish warned there could be years of legal challenges if the Premier League is curtailed, with French clubs already exploring damages claims over their season prematurely ending last week.
A leading sports lawyer also raised the prospect of players refusing to take to the field if they feel unsafe playing as the coronavirus pandemic continues.
Parish's support for the league's "Project Restart" proposal came as Brighton and West Ham publicly resisted playing their remaining home games in neutral venues as they fight relegation.
The league is working with authorities to find a way for players to resume group training and play games by June at the earliest while ensuring that does not spread COVID-19 infections.
“We need to try to play if we can make it safe,” Parish tweeted. “I believe we can and should continue however imperfect the other elements: neutral venues empty stadia, etc. If we can’t make it work then I fear for next season. The game might never fully recover.”
Government rulings led to the French and Dutch league seasons ending last week. While Paris Saint-Germain was crowned French champion with 10 rounds of games remaining, Ajax - which was first on goal difference - will not be awarded the Dutch title.
Palace has little to play for, sitting midtable, but Parish said he wants the season completed for “reasons of sporting integrity" and to protect the league's finances. Liverpool is 25 points clear with nine games remaining.
“I want to crown Liverpool champions and give every other club a fair crack at the best league position they can achieve," Parish said. "I certainly don’t want to have difficult conversations about curtailing, voiding and points per game.
"The ramifications of each are complex and could involve legal challenges that run on for months, if not years. But, yes, it is partly about the money. And we should all care about the money.”
The Premier League fears losses of more than 1 billion pounds (around $1.3 billion) from an incomplete campaign as broadcasting commitments are not met.
The league has not commented on opposition to playing games in neutral stadiums, only saying after Friday's call with clubs that they all wanted to complete the season if it was safe.
“Ending the season early would undoubtedly leave the Premier League more exposed to costly and reputationally damaging legal action from certain disgruntled clubs, unhappy with the difficult decisions that would ultimately follow in determining league positions,” lawyer Simon Leaf, head of sport at Mishcon de Reya, told The Associated Press.
“After all, a significant portion of the revenues that the clubs receive from broadcasters and sponsors is related to where the club finishes in the table.”
Players would have to face regular COVID-19 tests to show they were clear of the disease.
“We could still see players themselves take their own legal stand by refusing to take the field for fear of their own safety and clubs unhappy with the venue allocations threaten action," Leaf said.
It is almost two months since the competition was suspended and the league's rule book has no guidelines for resolving standings if a team cannot play all 38 games.
“The league will need to continue to manage the situation delicately in order to keep all sides on board and avoid league places and revenues being determined in the courtroom rather than on the pitch,” Leaf said.
The national lockdown remains in place through at least Thursday in Britain where more than 28,000 people have died in around two months in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for the new coronavirus.
The Premier League faced heavy criticism Sunday from one of the main pundits for the broadcaster that provides the league's single biggest revenue stream.
Gary Neville, the former England and Manchester United defender turned Sky Sports commentator, said the Premier League was having a “nightmare" and was “hiding, scared to death of communicating” its plans fully in public.
“No one wants to be responsible for this one! Just in case the unthinkable happens," Neville tweeted. "I’d respect them more if they said ‘We accept the increase in Health Risk but it’s one we are willing to take.' They won’t as they are frightened to death!"
Some Premier League players returned to club training facilities last week to resume individual work. Players in Spain and Italy will be allowed to do the same from Monday.
While the leagues in England, Italy and Spain will not start until at least June, the German top flight is hoping to resume this month.
But the Bundesliga's plans were unsettled by three positive tests for coronavirus last week at Cologne, reportedly including two players.
Cologne said Sunday that players will only resume training after two consecutive negative COVID-19 tests, ruling out the need for the entire squad and coaching staff to go into quarantine.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brighton objects to use of neutral venues to resume Premier League</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">New York – Brighton has become the first English Premier League club to publicly oppose plans to try to restart the season in neutral stadiums during the coronavirus pandemic.
As the COVID-19 death toll surpassed 28,000 in Britain, Brighton chief executive Paul Barber accepted that resuming sporting events would require compromises but said Saturday that the league's integrity would be damaged if teams couldn't play at home.
West Ham vice chair Karren Brady said "no one wants” neutral stadiums but was not as direct in her opposition to the league's "Project Restart” plan, given the need for authorities to approve venues.
The Premier League sees using only up to half of its 20 stadiums as the most viable way of completing the season, which was suspended almost two months ago.
Police also have backed teams not playing at home, even with no fans present, to prevent them from gathering outside the stadiums. Supporters are likely to be prevented from attending sporting events for many months in Britain to limit the spread of COVID-19 infections.
The Premier League, which held a conference call with all clubs on Friday, hopes team training sessions can resume within weeks but games are not likely to be played for at least another month.
"Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises,” Barber said, "and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.
"But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.”
Barber said Brighton had not been approached about using its Amex Stadium, which is more isolated than the likes of Anfield, which is surrounded by rows of tightly packed houses in Liverpool. West Ham also has a venue that fans can be kept away from as it sits on the Olympic Park used for the 2012 London Games.
The government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority would have to approve the locations of games during the pandemic.
"They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance,” Brady said. "But like everything else, nothing has been agreed.”
West Ham and Brighton are in a scrap to avoid relegation with nine games remaining. Brighton is two points and three places above the drop zone. West Ham is only out of danger due to a superior goal difference.
Barber highlighted how four of Brighton's five remaining home games are against some of Europe's biggest clubs: Arsenal, Manchester United, leader Liverpool and defending champion Manchester City.
"The disadvantages of us not playing the league’s top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious," Barber said.
"Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn’t equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn’t play our first 29 matches of the season in this way. So, in our opinion one thing doesn’t cancel out the other.”
Britain's national lockdown currently runs through Thursday, with the league waiting to see how restrictions will be eased and whether the competition can restart now the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak has passed.
Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, whose responsibilities include sport, said after talks with leagues on Friday that he was working on plans that deliver for Britons who "desperately want sport back on.”
But Brighton striker Glenn Murray has expressed reservations about playing again soon given the risks of players spreading the coronavirus.
"I understand the public is desperate to get football back, but it is us that are going to be going out there and competing against other teams," Murray said. "Everyone is in different situations, I have children at home, I wouldn’t want to jeopardize them, some footballers have newly born children who might be more susceptible to getting the disease. Some are living with elderly parents. It is a really difficult situation to agree on.”
Isolated sessions at training grounds started last week at some clubs, including Brighton, for players to do individual fitness work. Phase two of the restart plan envisages group training be allowed again, then approval would be required for the restart of domestic fixtures.
"The only common theme from all the clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game," Brady wrote in Saturday’s editions of The Sun. "There is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again. There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Liverpool has a 25-point lead with nine games left.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Perth suggested as EPL base as clubs air doubts about neutral venues</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An English agent based in Perth has reportedly suggested – and received support from some clubs and an Australian senator – that the English Premier League season could be completed in Western Australia.
However, some Premier League clubs have already come out publicly against the proposal to try and restart the season in neutral stadiums amid the coronavirus pandemic.
As the COVID-19 death toll surpassed 28,000 in Britain, Brighton & Hove Albion became the first English Premier League club to publicly oppose plans.
Chief executive Paul Barber accepted that resuming sporting events would require compromises but said on Saturday that the league's integrity would be damaged if teams could not play at home.
West Ham vice-chairwoman Karren Brady said "no one wants" neutral stadiums but was not as direct in her opposition to the league's "Project Restart" plan, given the need for authorities to approve venues.
Brighton and West Ham are in a scrap to avoid relegation, with the Seagulls having five of their nine remaining games scheduled to be played at home.
The Premier League sees using only up to half of the 20 stadiums as the most viable way of completing the season, which was suspended almost two months ago.
But the UK Sun reported that Australia could host the remaining games of the Premier League season, with English agent Gary Williams, who lives in Perth, behind the proposal.
The Sun also reported that Williams' proposal had been backed by Labor senator Glenn Sterle and that several Premier League clubs had been "alerted and are happy to oblige".
"I have had discussions with contacts at Premier League clubs and they like the idea," Williams told the paper.
"I have also spoken with government officials and they are enthusiastic. We are speaking again this week.
"Everybody is safe here. The government has lifted many restrictions.
"We are sitting round in groups of ten, we can walk around and the beaches are open. We have had four new cases in the last ten days."
Supporters in Britain are likely to be prevented from attending sporting events for many months to limit the spread of COVID-19 infections.
The Premier League, which held a conference call with all clubs on Friday, hopes team training sessions can resume within weeks – after isolated sessions at training grounds started last week at some clubs – but games are not likely to be played for at least another month.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football: West Ham vice-chairman sure Premier League can overcome restart challenges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady insists that every Premier League club wants to complete the season despite there being "a lot of obstacles" to restarting the campaign.
LONDON: West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady insists that every Premier League club wants to complete the season despite there being "a lot of obstacles" to restarting the campaign.
Clubs were presented with the league's "Project Restart" plans at a meeting on Friday (May 1) and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-2020 season must be played at neutral venues.
That is an extra sticking point to a litany of other logistical issues as there remains opposition on sporting integrity grounds about the idea of not finishing the campaign on a home-and-away basis.
"At yesterday's meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart," said Brady in her column for the Sun newspaper.
"The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game.
"Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again.
"There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make."
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said on Thursday that the idea of not playing matches home and away was a "further imperfection" on top of games being behind closed doors.
Before plans to return to playing can progress, the Premier League clubs must also address the thorny issues of testing and player welfare.
Players, coaches and backroom staff would reportedly be tested two or three times a week and could be forced to quarantine in hotels away from their families to help prevent the spread of the virus.
The Bundesliga's ambitious plans to return to playing matches this month were dealt a blow with the news on Friday that three people at Cologne have tested positive for coronavirus and been placed in a 14-day quarantine.
Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero admitted this week that players are "scared" at the prospect of being rushed back into action, while Brighton's Glenn Murray questioned whether it is right for football's return to drain resources from public services such as ambulance crews and police.
The proposal of neutral venues by the Premier League is designed to reduce the number of medical, security and broadcast personnel needed at every match.
"It's clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the Government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority," added Brady.
"They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brighton, West Ham raise doubts about neutral venues for EPL</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON — Brighton has become the first English Premier League club to publicly oppose plans to try to restart the season in neutral stadiums during the coronavirus pandemic.
As the COVID-19 death toll surpassed 28,000 in Britain, Brighton chief executive Paul Barber accepted that resuming sporting events would require compromises but said Saturday that the league's integrity would be damaged if teams couldn't play at home.
West Ham vice chair Karren Brady said “no one wants” neutral stadiums but was not as direct in her opposition to the league's “Project Restart” plan, given the need for authorities to approve venues.
The Premier League sees using only up to half of the 20 stadiums as the most viable way of completing the season, which was suspended almost two months ago.
Police also have backed teams not playing at home, even with no fans present, to prevent them from gathering outside the stadiums. Supporters are likely to be prevented from attending sporting events for many months in Britain to limit the spread of COVID-19 infections.
The Premier League, which held a conference call with all clubs on Friday, hopes team training sessions can resume within weeks but games are not likely to be played for at least another month.
“Clearly, we must all be prepared to accept some compromises,” Barber said, "and we fully appreciate why playing behind closed doors is very likely to be a necessary compromise to play our remaining games while continuing to fully support the government’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.
“But at this critical point in the season playing matches in neutral venues has, in our view, potential to have a material effect on the integrity of the competition.”
Barber said Brighton had not been approached about using its Amex Stadium, which is more isolated than the likes of Anfield, which is surrounded by rows of tightly packed houses in Liverpool. West Ham also has a venue that fans can be kept away from as it sits on the Olympic Park used for the 2012 Games.
The government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority would have to approve the locations of games during the pandemic.
“They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance,” Brady said. “But like everything else, nothing has been agreed.”
West Ham and Brighton are in a scrap to avoid relegation with nine games remaining. Brighton is two points and three places above the drop zone. West Ham is only out of danger due to a superior goal difference.
Barber highlighted how four of Brighton's five remaining home games are against some of Europe's biggest clubs: Arsenal, Manchester United, leader Liverpool and defending champion Manchester City.
“The disadvantages of us not playing the league’s top teams in our home stadium and in familiar surroundings, even with 27,000 Albion fans very unlikely to be present at the Amex, are very obvious," Barber said.
“Clearly, we must accept there may also be some benefit from playing our remaining four away matches at neutral venues but the fixture list simply isn’t equally balanced at this stage of the season, and we didn’t play our first 29 matches of the season in this way. So, in our opinion one thing doesn’t cancel out the other.”
Britain's national lockdown currently runs through Thursday, with the league waiting to see how restrictions will be eased and whether the competition can restart now the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak has passed.
Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, whose responsibilities include sport, said after talks with leagues on Friday that he was working on plans that deliver for Britons who “desperately want sport back on.”
But Brighton striker Glenn Murray has expressed reservations about playing again soon given the risks of players spreading the coronavirus.
“I understand the public is desperate to get football back, but it is us that are going to be going out there and competing against other teams," Murray said. “Everyone is in different situations, I have children at home, I wouldn’t want to jeopardize them, some footballers have newly born children who might be more susceptible to getting the disease. Some are living with elderly parents. It is a really difficult situation to agree on.”
Isolated sessions at training grounds started last week at some clubs, including Brighton, for players to do individual fitness work. Phase two of the restart plan envisages group training be allowed again, then approval would be required for the restart of domestic fixtures.
“The only common theme from all the clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game," Brady wrote in Saturday’s editions of “The Sun” newspaper. "There is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again. There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Liverpool has a 25-point lead with nine games left.

    <h5 class="mb-1">West Ham's Brady sure Premier League can overcome restart challenges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">West Ham vice-chairperson Karren Brady insists that every Premier League club wants to complete the season despite there being "a lot of obstacles" to restarting the campaign.
Clubs were presented with the league's "Project Restart" plans at a meeting on Friday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-2020 season must be played at neutral venues.
That is an extra sticking point to a litany of other logistical issues as there remains opposition on sporting integrity grounds about the idea of not finishing the campaign on a home-and-away basis.
"At yesterday's meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart," said Brady in her column for the Sun newspaper.
"The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game.
"Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again.
"There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make."
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said on Thursday that the idea of not playing matches home and away was a "further imperfection" on top of games being behind closed doors.
Before plans to return to playing can progress, the Premier League clubs must also address the thorny issues of testing and player welfare.
Players, coaches and backroom staff would reportedly be tested two or three times a week and could be forced to quarantine in hotels away from their families to help prevent the spread of the virus.
The Bundesliga's ambitious plans to return to playing matches this month were dealt a blow with the news on Friday that three people at Cologne have tested positive for coronavirus and been placed in a 14-day quarantine.
Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero admitted this week that players are "scared" at the prospect of being rushed back into action, while Brighton's Glenn Murray questioned whether it is right for football's return to drain resources from public services such as ambulance crews and police.
The proposal of neutral venues by the Premier League is designed to reduce the number of medical, security and broadcast personnel needed at every match.
"It's clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the Government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority," added Brady.
"They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Liverpool's telling approach to Premier League 'Project Restart' meetings</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Liverpool are reportedly taking a back seat in the current meetings to determine what will happen to the 2019/20 Premier League season.
Talks between the 20 clubs are ongoing as the division seeks to find a way to resume amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis.
There is said to be a will to finish the current season across almost all clubs, but the prospect of playing all of the remaining matches behind closed doors at neutral venues is said to be causing some concern among clubs who aren't keen on the idea.
Teams near the bottom of the table are not thought to be too enthusiastic about the idea of forfeiting home advantage for a number of crucial games, even though there would be no fans present.
But with the Premier League stating that the neutral venue option - with matches played at around 8-10 stadia - would be the only way to get the season finished and protect valuable TV revenues, a vote will take place on the plan next week.
For Liverpool, the current suspension of football has left the club waiting to see if they would be afforded the opportunity to seal a much longed-for league title, a first in 30 years.
With any prospect of the season being declared "null and void" never really gaining any traction, the options before the league would either see the season played out - with Liverpool needing at most two wins from nine games to be champions - or curtailed and the final standings determined via a points per game system.
Liverpool would be keen on the season being played out, and have joined their other top six clubs in pushing for that scenario, but a report from The Athletic - which adds that Arsenal and Aston Villa are said to be very keen to play - claims that the Reds have stopped talking in the current meetings, and maintain a "Sphinx-like cool" over whatever will happen.
Should the season be curtailed then the likelihood is that Liverpool would be named champions, just as Paris Saint-Germain were in France.
PSG were 12 points clear with a game in hand when Ligue 1 was halted, while Liverpool sit 25 points clear of second-placed Manchester City.
So the Reds are perhaps safe in the knowledge that they will be champions anyway, but would like to complete the job on the pitch.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Every Premier League club wants to complete season, says Karren Brady</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">WEST HAM vice-chairman Karren Brady says that every Premier League club wants to complete the season but has warned there are “a lot of obstacles” to overcome.
Clubs were presented with the league’s ‘Project Restart’ plans at a meeting yesterday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-20 season must be played at neutral venues.
That could prove to be a sticking point as there remains opposition on competition and integrity grounds about the idea of not finishing the campaign on a home-and-away basis.
“At yesterday’s meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart,” she wrote in her column for the Sun.
“The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game.
“Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again.
“There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Brady has detailed a four-phase strategy for a return to action, with the first one – isolated training sessions at training grounds – already under way.
Phase two would be a return to group training, phase three is the restart of domestic games, and the final phase would see a return to international matches.
“Phase three will include discussions on the possibility of playing at neutral grounds, which no one wants, but it’s clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the Government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority,” she added.
“They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance.
“But like everything else, nothing has been agreed as we are still in phase one.”
The PA news agency understands the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing – which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.
It is also understood the EFL is still intent on playing the remainder of its campaigns behind closed doors at the regular venues, but the governing body is aware current plans may need to change.

    <h5 class="mb-1">‘Every club said it wants the season to restart’ - West Ham vice-chairman</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady says that every Premier League club wants to complete the season but has warned there are “a lot of obstacles” to overcome.
Clubs were presented with the league’s ‘Project Restart’ plans at a meeting on Friday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-20 season must be played at neutral venues.
That could prove to be a sticking point as there remains opposition on competition and integrity grounds about the idea of not finishing the campaign on a home-and-away basis.
“At yesterday’s meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart,” she wrote in her column for the Sun.
“We all know that it is going to take a lot of working together, good faith, careful thought and compromises if we have any chance of that happening.
“The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game.
“Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again.
“There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Brady has detailed a four-phase strategy for a return to action, with the first one — isolated training sessions at training grounds — already under way.
Phase two would be a return to group training, phase three is the restart of domestic games, and the final phase would see a return to international matches.
“Phase three will include discussions on the possibility of playing at neutral grounds, which no one wants, but it’s clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the UK government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority,” she added.
“They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance.
“But like everything else, nothing has been agreed as we are still in phase one.”
According to media reports in the UK, the Premier League will look at using between eight and 10 stadiums, with venues likely to be chosen for ease of ensuring social distancing — which would appear to favour more out-of-town sites.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Brady: Lots of obstacles to overcome before EPL can restart</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LONDON (AP) - The 20 English Premier League clubs all want to complete the season but there are also a lot of obstacles to overcome, West Ham vice chair Karren Brady said Saturday.
The clubs were presented with the league’s “Project Restart” plans at a meeting on Friday and were told that the remaining 92 matches of a 2019-20 season halted by the coronavirus pandemic must be played behind closed doors at eight to 10 neutral stadiums, which could prove a major sticking point.
“At yesterday’s meeting every club said it wants the season to restart,” Brady wrote in editions of “The Sun” newspaper. “We all know it is going to take a lot of working together, good faith, careful thought and compromises if we have any chance of that happening.
“The only common theme from all the clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game. Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again. There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make.”
Brady detailed a four-phase plan for a return, with the first one - isolated sessions at training grounds - already under way. Phase two would be a return to group training, phase three is the restart of games and the final phase would see a return to international matches.
“Phase three will include discussions on the possibility of playing at neutral grounds, which no one wants, but it’s clear the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval,” she said.
“Project Restart” has June 8 as the potential earliest date for matches. It means if Liverpool’s 30-year title drought ends - the team has a 25-point lead with nine games remaining - it will not happen in front of its own fans or at its Anfield stadium.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Karren Brady sure PL can overcome restart challenges</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">West Ham vice-chairman Karren Brady insists that every Premier League club wants to complete the season despite there being "a lot of obstacles" to restarting the campaign.
Clubs were presented with the league's "Project Restart" plans at a meeting on Friday and were told the remaining 92 matches of the 2019-2020 season must be played at neutral venues.
That is an extra sticking point to a litany of other logistical issues as there remains opposition on sporting integrity grounds about the idea of not finishing the campaign on a home-and-away basis.
"At yesterday's meeting, every club said it wants the season to restart," said Brady in her column for the Sun newspaper. "The only common theme from all the Prem clubs is that any compromises have to be fair and uphold the integrity of the game. Players and managers have to be key decision-makers on the protocols as there is a long way to go from where we are now to actually getting playing again.
"There are a lot of obstacles to overcome and no doubt many compromises to make."
Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said on Thursday that the idea of not playing matches home and away was a "further imperfection" on top of games being behind closed doors. Before plans to return to playing can progress, the Premier League clubs must also address the thorny issues of testing and player welfare.
Main links
Players, coaches and backroom staff would reportedly be tested two or three times a week and could be forced to quarantine in hotels away from their families to help prevent the spread of the virus.
The Bundesliga's ambitious plans to return to playing matches this month were dealt a blow with the news on Friday that three people at Cologne have tested positive for coronavirus and been placed in a 14-day quarantine.
Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero admitted this week that players are "scared" at the prospect of being rushed back into action, while Brighton's Glenn Murray questioned whether it is right for football's return to drain resources from public services such as ambulance crews and police.
The proposal of neutral venues by the Premier League is designed to reduce the number of medical, security and broadcast personnel needed at every match.
"It's clear that the location of the games when the league recommences will be subject to approval from both the Government and Sports Grounds Safety Authority," added Brady. "They could argue neutral grounds better protect the welfare of all involved and reduce the burden on public services like police and ambulance."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England's two-match test series in Sri Lanka, which has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been rescheduled for January next year, Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) CEO Ashley de Silva has said.
England were scheduled to play tests in Galle and Colombo in March before the coronavirus outbreak shut down sport worldwide as countries introduced lockdown measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
"We are in the process of rescheduling the tours that have been postponed," De Silva told Sri Lankan newspaper Daily News. "England has been already rescheduled for the month of January next year but the dates have not been finalised.
"At the same time we are also looking at exploring the possibility of rescheduling postponed tours and looking at the windows which are available and alternatives too.
"South Africa is one of the tours which we are looking at rescheduling. We are engaged in discussions with the member countries and see how it can be planned out."
South Africa's limited-overs tour of Sri Lanka -- three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 games -- was scheduled to take place in June before it was postponed.
"There are also two other tours which are scheduled to take place with India and Bangladesh due to tour Sri Lanka in June-July and July-August respectively," De Silva added.
"We will explore the possibility of playing those two tours in another week or two."

    <h5 class="mb-1">England's tour of Sri Lanka rescheduled for January, says SLC CEO</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Colombo: Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) CEO Ashley de Silva has said that England’s Test tour of Sri Lanka which could not be played out in March due to the coronavirus outbreak has been rescheduled to January 2021.
“We are in the process of rescheduling the tours that have been postponed. England has been already rescheduled for the month of January next year but the dates have not been finalised,” de Silva told Daily News.
“At the same time, we are also looking at exploring the possibility of rescheduling postponed tours and looking at the windows which are available and alternatives too.
“South Africa is one of the tours which we are looking at rescheduling. We are engaged in discussions with the member countries and see how it can be planned out.”
England was playing Sri Lanka President’s XI in a 4-day match at the P. Sara Oval in Colombo when the coronavirus outbreak saw the decision being made by ECB along with the SLC to postpone the tour.
“Due to the COVID-19 pandemic worsening globally, and after discussions with Sri Lanka Cricket, we have today made the decision to return our players to the UK and postpone the forthcoming Test series between Sri Lanka and England.
“At this time, the physical and mental wellbeing of our players and support teams is paramount. We will now look to bring them home to their families as soon as possible. These are completely unprecedented times, and decisions like this go beyond cricket.
“We would like to thank our colleagues at Sri Lanka Cricket for their outstanding support and assistance throughout this situation. We look forward to returning to Sri Lanka in the very near future to fulfil this important Test series,” the ECB had said in a release.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England’s Test tour of Sri Lanka, which could not be completed in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has been rescheduled to January next year, claims SLC CEO Ashley de Silva.
England had spent around 10 days in Sri Lanka in March and played a warm-up match before the tour was called-off due to the coronavirus outbreak. It was supposed to be a two-Test series as part of the World Test Championship.
“We are in the process of rescheduling the tours that have been postponed. England has been already rescheduled for the month of January next year but the dates have not been finalised,” de Silva told Daily News.
“At the same time, we are also looking at exploring the possibility of rescheduling postponed tours and looking at the windows which are available and alternatives too.
“South Africa is one of the tours which we are looking at rescheduling. We are engaged in discussions with the member countries and see how it can be planned out.”
However, England are scheduled to tour India in January for a five-Test series, so, it remains to be seen how the scheduling will work out.
All cricketing activity has come to a halt due to the pandemic, throwing the international calendar haywire.
India too were scheduled to tour Sri Lanka for a limited-overs series after the IPL, which has been postponed indefinitely.
“There are also two other tours which are scheduled to take place, with India and Bangladesh due to tour Sri Lanka in June-July and July-August respectively.
“We will explore the possibility of playing those two tours in another week or two,” de Silva added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tommy Wright opens up on St Johnstone exit as he pinpoints 'natural end' departure factor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tommy Wright reckons he has left St Johnstone at the "right time" despite the emotion of departing after a brilliant seven year spell with the Perth club.
He leaves as the most successful manager in the history of the club having overseen solid league performances and winning the Scottish Cup.
The Northern Irishman took over from Steve Lomas in the summer of 2013 and still had two years left on his contract.
Plans were already in place to leave the club at the end of the campaign, and he has decided now is the time to part company during the coronavirus lockdown.
Speaking to Saints TV, Wright said: "It was extremely difficult, obviously being at the club so long I've got a lot of feelings for the club, lots and lots of happy memories and worked with a lot of good people both on the pitch and off the pitch.
"It was something that was being considered for a while, even as far back as at the end of the season when we finished eighth (in 2017-18).
"We sort of made a decision to see if over the next couple of years we could bring the age of the squad down and it might be time for me to move on. Fortunately, we have done that. There have been two good seasons.
"It's been something that I felt that when you are at a club for a long period of time, sometimes there comes a point where you need a break and I do need a break.
"It's a tough job. People don't give you sympathy being in football management, but it's 365 days and 24 hours a day and I just felt that this season, if we did well, it would have been the perfect time for me to leave the club in a really strong position.
"The future is really bright on the pitch. I won't be the one that will take the team forward but I think that could be good, not only for me but for the club and team as well.
"Hopefully, I think it can be a top-six side and in a really good position. It hasn't been an easy decision but I think it is the right time."
Wright reminisced about St Johnstone's only Scottish Cup success to date in 2014 when they defeated Dundee United 2-0 at Hampden Park and the club's adventures in the Europa League qualifying rounds.
"I actually had no doubt that we wouldn't win the game," Wright added. "I just had this feeling that it was written in the stars that it was my first season, 50th game and all that. It just felt that we couldn't lose that game.
"Once we got the second goal, I knew there was no chance we would concede two goals and it was just total relief and you can enjoy it.
"When the final whistle went, it was probably the happiest moment of my life.
"The disappointment of Europe, which still irks me, is that we got beat to teams (that we should have beaten). We beat Rosenborg, go out to Minsk; beat Luzern, go out to Trnava.
"If it was the other way round, I don't know if you would get as much satisfaction, but there is always that wee bit of disappointment."
The 56-year-old insisted he has a good relationship with chairman Steve Brown and it was his decision to end his nine-year association with Saints.
"There hasn't been that many downsides. It's been a great job. I've had great support," the Northern Irishman continued.
"It's not a normal manager-chairman relationship. He has supported me immensely. During a period earlier this season, which was the worst run, particularly with the timing of it, he never once put me under any pressure.
"And that shows that I had trust in the players and he had the ultimate trust in me as a manager.
"The relationship is fine. We spoke this week, we spoke over a period of time and it is something that I actually feel that the timing of it is right, right for the club.
"Seven years is a long time to have the same manager. People have to realise that sometimes things come to a natural end."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tommy Wright has emerged as the favourite to succeed Michael O'Neill as Northern Ireland manager following his departure from Saint Johnstone.
The former Ballymena boss had been in charge at McDiarmid Park since 2013 and still had two years left on his contract.

According to the Daily Star, Barca have informed Premier League clubs that nine players, including Antoine Griezmann, will be available during this summer's transfer window.
Griezmann has previously been linked with Manchester United as the Catalan giants seemingly line up a move for Inter Milan's Lautaro Martinez.
The report claims that Luis Suarez, Ousmane Dembele, Ivan Rakitic, Arturo Vidal, Samuel Umtiti, Nelson Semedo and Sergi Roberto have also been made available.
Philippe Coutinho is also allegedly surplus to requirements at Camp Nou, with the Brazil international, who is currently on loan at Bayern Munich, being linked with the likes of Chelsea, Man United and Newcastle United.
The Spanish champions have also been linked with a big-money move for Neymar, but head coach Quique Setienrecently admitted that a deal for the Paris Saint-Germain attacker was unlikely.

Barca chiefs have hinted that a number of players will be allowed to leave the club and now Suarez is unsure of where he will be playing next.
On the prospect of a switch to USA, he told Spanish newspaper Marca: "You never know. I have a contract at Barcelona but, in the future, it's an attractive league. The United States is a nice option."
At 33, Suarez is also getting to the twilight of his career and as a result, the club are ready to listen to potential clients for the Uruguayan.
His contract with the Spanish team runs until 2021 with an option to further extend the deal for one year.
Meanwhile, Jurgen Klopp is currently planning to make a £80m move for Barcelona winger Ousmane Dembele despite the Frenchman’s poor form.
It was gathered that the Liverpool manager is looking to reunite with the player who he liked during their days at German club Borussia Dortmund.

The Catalans are looking for a long term replacement for their ageing forward Luis Suarez who clocked 33 earlier this year.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barcelona could offload Suarez to the MLS to raise £62m</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Barcelona could offload their star striker Luis Suarez to the MLS in order to raise £62m to ease their financial status, according to a report in the Sun. 
David Beckham owned Inter Miami are interested in signing Suarez according to the report and Barcelona are keen on releasing the 33-year-old striker.
Barcelona need to raise £62m for the club’s financial well being after taking a significant hit due to the coronavirus and offloading a player like Suarez who earns high wages could ease the club’s ailing finances, as per the report.
The Catalan giants are willing to listen to offers for Suarez given the Uruguayan striker’s advancing age despite netting 14 goals in 23 games for Barcelona this season.
Speaking to Marca about a potential move to the MLS as cited in the Sun, Suarez said:
“You never know. I have a contract at Barcelona but, in the future, it’s an attractive league. The United States is a nice option.”
Getting Suarez off their wage bill could help Barcelona free up funds for usage by the club as they look to recover from the financial losses due to the coronavirus.
While Beckham’s Inter Miami are looking for a marquee signing to bring to the club ahead of their first season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barcelona should plan to lure transfer target away from Real Madrid</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The midfield of Barcelona and Real Madrid are full of superstars who are in their 30s. These players are playing in their last few seasons of football for their respective clubs and are bound to retire in the near future.
Quique Setien has listed two of their experienced midfielders Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal in the upcoming transfer market and is currently negotiating their transfers deals away from the Camp Nou. Over the past few days, there have been rumours that Arthur Melo and Frenkie de Jong might also consider moves away from the club but the duo are yet to receive any transfer offer.
Real Madrid who were once fixated on signing Fabian Ruiz but in the past few days have shown more interest in signing other midfielders instead. According to the Don Balon, Zinedine Zidane feels signing Camavinga would the most ideal fit for the Santiago Bernabeu. This is because the young Frenchman is only 17 years old and is set to become one of the best defensive midfielders who can act as a long term replacement for Casemiro.
The Spanish giants must capitalise on this opportunity and sign Fabian Ruiz in the upcoming transfer window. In the past few seasons, Ruiz has been one of the consistent midfielders who has been extremely calm and composed in the heart of Napoli’s midfield. He is the main reason Napoli have had such an elegant run in the Champions League this season. Signing the young midfielder could help fill the void for Ivan Rakitic who has played such an integral role in Barca’s success over the last few seasons.
Ruiz has also shown great signs of developing into a defensive player who could potentially fill in the shoes of Sergio Busquets if Barca’s staff are able to focuses on those aspects of his game.
Ruiz has an estimated market value of around 50 million Euros. Do you think Barcelona should sign him in the upcoming transfer window?

The player is of Real Madrid's liking, but Napoli has other plans for Fabian. 
'La Gazzetta dello Sport' says that Aurelio de Laurentiis, the president of the Italian team, doesn't plan to transfer one of his most important players.
Napoli hope to convince Fabian to stay.
Recently there was speculation that Fabián and Jovic would be included in the same operation. However, Napoli have directly ruled out this option.
Fabian has a contract with Napoli until 2023. The footballer's agent said that the conversations for a possible contract extension were stopped at the time. Fabian's future remains unclear...

    <h5 class="mb-1">Transfer News: Raul Jimenez discusses potential Barcelona or Real Madrid move amid Manchester United interest</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">As quoted by Daily Express, Raul Jimenez has talked up the prospect of joining either Barcelona or Real Madrid, two clubs he has admitted will be hard to turn down. The Mexican international is the subject of interest from Manchester United over a move in the summer transfer window.
Raul Jimenez has been part of the Jorge Mendes revolution at Wolves, which has seen the club undergo a drastic transformation. From being mired in the promotion dogfight season after season while in the Championship to becoming European football contenders, it has been a spectacular 180 degree turnaround; and Jimenez has been a big part of that.
Nearing 100 appearances for Wolves, Jimenez has a solid tally of 39 goals and 18 assists, perfectly embodying the kind of football Nuno Espirito Santo wishes to play. His progress has ended up making the 28-year-old a target for Manchester United. However, Barcelona or Real Madrid could hold the advantage over United in pursuit of the Mexican striker.
“I find out [about the links with other clubs] through social media. They have already put me at Real Madrid, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and every day comes out a new team that want [to sign] me. I have to be calm. If they are talking about me it is because I am doing things well; I would like to continue in England.”
“I am happy, adapted and I like the idea [of staying in the Premier League]. If you tell me that tomorrow an offer from Real Madrid or Barcelona comes, it is obvious that you do not let such an opportunity go. But if I stay here I am fighting to qualify for the Champions League, for important things.”
Manchester United are in search of a striker who would primarily be a backup for Anthony Martial, but someone who can also provide healthy competition to the Frenchman. To that end, several strikers have been linked with the Red Devils, with a permanent deal for Odion Ighalo being touted as well.
As for Barcelona and Real Madrid, there has not been any concrete interest from either of the La Liga heavyweights. However, Jimenez could be a decent fit at either club. While Barcelona want a long-term successor for Luis Suarez, the struggles of Luka Jovic at the Bernabeu means Real Madrid have been looking for a striker as well.
Manchester United will be keen to beat the other suitors, but the comments by Jimenez clearly point towards Barcelona and Real Madrid being the favourites to sign him, should they make a move. What now remains to be seen is if Jimenez does leave Wolves this summer and if so, what his fee is, considering Wolves would be keen to recoup the £34.5 million they paid for him.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barcelona 'willing to listen to offers for Luis Suarez' amid coronavirus crisis</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Barcelona are reportedly prepared to let go of Luis Suarez this summer as the Spanish club aims to raise funds amid the lack of match-day income and television money caused by the coronavirus outbreak.
La Liga remains suspended at the moment - though matches are set to resume behind closed doors - and even clubs the size of Barcelona have seen their finances stretched by the pandemic.
The Catalan club have been exploring new ways of generating income and selling players could be one of the tactics used.
Spanish newspaper Marca report that Suarez could be a prime candidate to be offloaded this summer, with many MLS clubs interested in signing the Uruguayan.
Inter Miami president David Beckham has previously spoken of his desire to bring the former Liverpool striker to America, while Suarez himself has admitted that he may move to the MLS one day.
The 33-year-old said some months ago: "You never know. I have a contract at Barcelona but, in the future, it's an attractive league. The United States is a nice option."
However, the report adds that Suarez is still seen as an important player by coaches at Camp Nou and Saurez still has at least one year remaining on his Barcelona contract.
There is an option to extend his deal for a further year beyond 2021 if Suarez plays 60 per cent of Barcelona's games next season.
The Uruguay international has scored 14 goals and provided 11 assists this season, though he has only made 23 appearances in all competitions due to calf and knee injuries.
Barcelona officials are also aware that Suarez has a close bond with superstar teammate Lionel Messi and there are few clubs who will be able to afford his wages.
However, MLS officials would leap at the chance to bring another marquee signing to the league after other striking greats Thierry Henry, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and David Villa all had spells in America.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Real Madrid 'to offload five players in summer sale'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Even before the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, Real were allegedly in a position where they needed to reduce their wage bill in order to accommodate potential new arrivals.
However, according to AS, playing games behind closed doors will result in further revenue loss, resulting in an increasing desire to part ways with several members of Zinedine Zidane's squad.
As well as being prepared to sell Marcelo, James Rodriguez and Gareth Bale, club officials want to offload Nacho, Lucas Vazquez and Mariano Diaz as soon as possible.
Despite the possible upheaval, the report says that Los Blancos are open to making no signings during the next transfer window.
That could likely lead to Achraf Hakimi, Sergio Reguilon and Martin Odegaard becoming part of the senior group after loan spells away from the club.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Table tennis: All competitions scrapped until end July says ITTF</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN: All table tennis competitions and events have been scrapped at least until the end of July due to the coronavirus, the international table tennis federation (ITTF) said on Saturday.
Following an update from its task force the ITTF said it was looking into potentially returning to action in August but would also need to cut costs.
"The current period of suspension of all ITTF events and activities has been extended up until the end of July 2020," it said in a statement.
"The situation is being monitored closely for an eventual restart of ITTF events in August 2020."
It said it was also cancelling all veterans tour events and Table Tennis X events for the entire year while looking into cost-cutting measures to meet the financial challenges.
"ITTF management have been asked to find ways to reduce operation costs overall, including the need for there to be some HR restructure in order to manage 2020 financial realities," it said.
The virus has wreaked havoc with the international sports calendar, forcing also the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and the Euro 2020 soccer championships to 2021.
But it has also cut deep into international federations' finances putting their future operations in doubt.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The Athletics Federation of India (AFI) is officially targeting a return to action by September even as the tenure of its office-bearers was extended till physical elections could be held when situation becomes conducive.
The AFI held its Special General Meeting via videoconferencing on Saturday to take stock of the road ahead in terms of planning and preparation of events and athletes. The extension of tenure had already been approved by AFI members earlier and was ratified during the SGM. AFI president Adille Sumariwalla was authorised to decide on fresh date of AGM and elections.
High Performance Director Volker Hermann, Chief Coach Bahadur Singh and Deputy Chief Coach Radhakrishnan Nair shared a prospective competition calendar, assuming resumption of domestic events in September.
“We had planned for competition in two phases but have had to draw up in one, delayed phase,” AFI Planning Committee chairman Lalit Bhanot said. IOA president Narinder Batra, attending the meeting, assured the AFI of support in securing contract extensions for overseas coaches and support staff.
The meeting also saw tributes paid to legendary coach Joginder Singh Saini, who passed away on March 1, and Sumariwalla announcing an online pre-Level 1 coaching module to provide proper guidance to parents and coaches of young athletes and avoid over-training and burnout.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: World Beach Games Postponed To 2023</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The second edition of the World Beach Games originally meant to take place in 2021 has been postponed to 2023.
According to a report by insidethegames, the competition which is one of the innovations by the Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) World Beach Games was postponed until 2023 because of the coronaviruspandemic.
The report stated ANOC’s Executive Council had decided not to stage the event as planned next year “to alleviate pressure on the National Olympic Committees (NOCs) and ensure they can focus on preparing their athletes for the rescheduled Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games”.
The bidding process for the event, which had been opened alongside the 2023 edition in January, has also been pushed back to 2021.
The 2023 games will effectively replace the 2021 edition, and the postponement could prompt the umbrella body to look at staging the event on a quadrennial basis instead of every two years.
Nigeria competed at the inaugural World Beach Games in Doha, Qatar from 12 to 16 October 2019.
In total, athletes representing Nigeria won one gold medal and one silver medal as the country finished in 11th place in the medal table.
“ANOC created the ANOC World Beach Games specifically for the benefit of the NOCs and their athletes, allowing NOCs to connect with a new generation of athletes and fans,” said ANOC Acting President, Robin Mitchell.
“Therefore, we have a responsibility to ensure that we continue to listen to our NOCs and deliver an event that is in their best interests.
“With Tokyo 2020 now scheduled for next year and then Beijing 2022 taking place just over six months later, the ANOC Executive Council has decided it would put too much pressure on NOCs to host the ANOC World Beach Games between the two Olympic Games.
“Of course, the ANOC World Beach Games involves different athletes and different sports from the Olympic Games, but ultimately it is the same NOCs who have to prepare the teams.
“By delaying the Games, we will reduce the workload of NOCs next year and ensure optimum preparation time for them to send their very best athletes in 2023.
“We will continue to remain flexible and adapt to the circumstances to ensure the long-term sustainable success of the ANOC World Beach Games.”

It said it was also cancelling all veterans tour events and Table Tennis X events for the entire year while looking into cost-cutting measures to meet the financial challenges.
“ITTF management have been asked to find ways to reduce operation costs overall, including the need for there to be some HR restructure in order to manage 2020 financial realities,” it said.
The virus has wreaked havoc with the international sports calendar, forcing also the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games and the Euro 2020 soccer championships to 2021.
But it has also cut deep into international federations’ finances putting their future operations in doubt. — Reuters

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN (Reuters) - All table tennis competitions and events have been scrapped at least until the end of July due to the coronavirus, the international table tennis federation (ITTF) said on Saturday.
Following an update from its task force the ITTF said it was looking into potentially returning to action in August but would also need to cut costs.
“The current period of suspension of all ITTF events and activities has been extended up until the end of July 2020,” it said in a statement.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: The Badminton World Federation (BWF) has postponed the Thomas and Uber Cup Finals that were initially scheduled to be held in Denmark in the last week of May.
Earlier this week, the BWF announced the postponement of the biennial event for the second time due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The world governing body has now decided to host the global badminton showpiece team championships from October 3 to 11 in Aarhus, Denmark.
The tournament was originally scheduled to be held from May 16-24, but was last month postponed for the first time to August 15-23 considering the worsening global health crisis and unavailability of flights from around the world for the participants.
Earlier this week, the Malaysia-based BWF postponed the tournament once again saying it was not possible to hold the event any time before September.
In a statement released, the world governing body noted: “Following the Danish Government’s decision on April 6 to extend a ban on larger gatherings in Denmark until the end of August, both parties agreed that it was no longer feasible to stage the championships on the re-scheduled dates of August 15-23.”
“The BWF in consultation and consensus with Badminton Denmark (tournament organisers), Sport Event Denmark and the local Aarhus government concluded that a move to October was the best solution,” the statement added.
Former player and now general secretary of the BWF, Thomas Lund assured that the health and safety of all is of prime importance. “Our main priority is the health, safety and well-being of athletes, staff, volunteers, judges and the entire badminton community. We listened to the advice of the World Health Organisation (WHO), various health experts, local authorities and the Danish Government and it became clear that hosting a big event like the Total BWF Thomas and Uber Cup Finals before September would be difficult,” Lund said.
Officially known as the Total BWF Thomas and Uber Cup Finals, this will be the 31st edition of the Thomas Cup and the 28th edition of the Uber Cup. The Thomas and Uber Cup Finals is the biennial international badminton championship contested by the men’s and women’s national teams of the BWF member associations.
The 2020 edition, scheduled to be played at the Ceres Arena in Aarhus, Denmark, will be the first time that Denmark will be hosting this international competition since England played host to the event, way back in 1982. China are the defending champions in the men’s section, while Japan will be defending their crown in the women’s category.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Sydney: Australian run machine Marnus Labuschagne is gearing up for a packed schedule to make up for the time lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic once cricket resumes.
All cricket is on hold right now due to the pandemic sweeping through the globe with several tours and tournaments being either cancelled or postponed.
“There is going to be a lot of tours that will need to be made up,” Labuschgne said.
“There’s going to be a whole heap of cricket in a very short time frame. We’ll be making up for missed time, that schedule is just going to be packed.”
Australia’s ODI series against New Zealand was called off after the first match, while the T20 World Cup is facing an uncertain future.
With several tours being rescheduled in an already congested calender, Laubuschagne feels players will be expected to play a lot more than usual.
“It’s going to be a bit different to what we’re used to. We’re going to have to be ready coming out of this break to play heaps and heaps of cricket.”
The 25-year-old, who rose to fame after coming in as Steve Smith’s concussion substitute in the Ashes last year, is disappointed to see the English county season also suffer.
“It’s very sad. I really enjoyed it last year. I loved Glamorgan, hence why I signed a two-year extension. It’s disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble,” he said.
Several boards like Cricket Australia are facing a financial crisis and the youngster feels the entire cricket community should come together and do whatever is in their hands to get the sport going again.
“It’s our responsibility, cricket on the whole, to make sure once this period is over that we get games on television and get the sport started again. We need to support each other,” he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus outbreak: Labuschagne ready for 'heaps of cricket' when sport resumes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia's Marnus Labuschagne is bracing for "heaps and heaps of cricket" once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the prolific top order batsman said on Saturday.
The global health crisis has halted international sports, postponing several bilateral cricket series and jeopardising this year's Twenty20 World Cup scheduled in October-November in Australia.
"There is going to be a lot of tours that will need to be made up," Labuschagne told Australian Associated Press (AAP).
"There's going to be a whole heap of cricket in a very short time frame. We'll be making up for missed time, that schedule is just going to be packed.
"It's going to be a bit different to what we're used to. We're going to have to be ready coming out of this break to play heaps and heaps of cricket."
The South Africa-born Labuschagne is probably best prepared for such a scenario, having been adjudged the busiest cricketer in an ESPNcricinfo analysis last October.
The 25-year-old has been a revelation since stepping up as Steve Smith’s concussion substitute at Lord’s in last year's Ashes series in England.
In the subsequent series against Pakistan and New Zealand, the right-hander smashed four centuries in five tests, including a maiden double hundred in Sydney earlier this year.
Labuschagne felt his Glamorgan stint helped him get better as a batsman and lamented not being able to reunite with the county as professional cricket remains suspended in England until at least July 1.
"I really enjoyed it last year. I loved Glamorgan, hence why I signed a two-year extension," he said.
"It's disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble. It's our responsibility, cricket on the whole, to make sure once this period is over that we get games on television and get the sport started again. We need to support each other."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australian batsman Marnus Labuschagne expects the cricketing schedule to be packed once action resumes after the Covid-19 pandemic subsides.
Professional sport all over the globe ground to a halt after the coronavirus, which started in the Wuhan province of China, began to spread its tentacles.
Cricket has been no exception with several bilateral series being postponed, while the Twenty20 World Cup scheduled to take place in October-November in Australia is in jeopardy of being cancelled.
"There is going to be a lot of tours that will need to be made up," Labuschagne told Australian Associated Press (AAP).
"There's going to be a whole heap of cricket in a very short time frame. We'll be making up for missed time, that schedule is just going to be packed. It's going to be a bit different to what we're used to. We're going to have to be ready coming out of this break to play heaps and heaps of cricket."
South African-born Labuschagne would have currently been playing county cricket with Glamorgan and hopes the global health crisis will not impact the sport negatively.
"I really enjoyed it last year. I loved Glamorgan, hence why I signed a two-year extension," he said.
"It's disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble. It's our responsibility, cricket on the whole, to make sure once this period is over that we get games on television and get the sport started again. We need to support each other."

"It's disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble. It's our responsibility, cricket on the whole, to make sure once this period is over that we get games on television and get the sport started again. We need to support each other."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Marnus Labuschagne ready for 'heaps of cricket' when sport resumes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SYDNEY: Australian run-machine Marnus Labuschagne is gearing up for a packed schedule to make up for the time lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic once cricket resumes.
All cricket is on hold right now due to the pandemic sweeping through the globe with several tours and tournaments being either cancelled or postponed.
"There is going to be a lot of tours that will need to be made up," Labuschgne told Australian Associated Press.
"There's going to be a whole heap of cricket in a very short time frame. We'll be making up for missed time, that schedule is just going to be packed."

Australia's ODI series against New Zealand was called off after the first match, while the T20 World Cup is facing an uncertain future.
With several tours being rescheduled in an already congested calendar, Labuschagne feels players will be expected to play a lot more than usual.
"It's going to be a bit different to what we're used to. We're going to have to be ready coming out of this break to play heaps and heaps of cricket."
The 25-year-old, who rose to fame after coming in as Steve Smith's concussion substitute in the Ashes last year, is disappointed to see the English county season also suffer.
"It's very sad. I really enjoyed it last year. I loved Glamorgan, hence why I signed a two-year extension. It's disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble," he said.
Several boards like Cricket Australia are facing a financial crisis and the youngster feels the entire cricket community should come together and do whatever is in their hands to get the sport going again.
"It's our responsibility, cricket on the whole, to make sure once this period is over that we get games on television and get the sport started again. We need to support each other," he added.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia’s batting star Marnus Labuschagne is bracing for ‘heaps of cricket’ whenever the action resumes once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Labuschagne has made the big leap from a fringe player to stardom after benefiting from a near non-stop stretch of games in England. The rise of Labuschagne, who a year ago was left off Cricket Australia’s contract list, has been nothing short of remarkable. Recently, Labuschagne was among the six new faces to be given a Cricket Australia contracts for the upcoming season.

“There’s going to be a whole heap of cricket in a very short time frame. We’ll be making up for a missed time, that schedule is just going to be packed.”
Australia’s ODI series against New Zealand was called off after the first match, while the T20 World Cup is facing an uncertain future. With several tours being rescheduled in an already congested calendar, Laubuschagne feels players will be expected to play a lot more than usual.

The 25-year-old, who rose to fame after coming in as Steve Smith’s concussion substitute in the Ashes last year, is disappointed to see the English county season also suffer.
South African-born Labuschagne would have currently been playing County cricket with Glamorgan and hopes the global health crisis will not impact the sport negatively.
“It’s very sad. I really enjoyed it last year. I loved Glamorgan, hence why I signed a two-year extension. It’s disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cricket-Labuschagne ready for 'heaps of cricket' when sport resumes</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">SYDNEY — Australia’s Marnus Labuschagne is bracing for “heaps and heaps of cricket” once the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the prolific top order batsman said on Saturday.
The global health crisis has halted international sports, postponing several bilateral cricket series and jeopardizing this year’s Twenty20 World Cup scheduled in October-November in Australia.
“There is going to be a lot of tours that will need to be made up,” Labuschagne told Australian Associated Press (AAP).
“There’s going to be a whole heap of cricket in a very short time frame. We’ll be making up for missed time, that schedule is just going to be packed.
“It’s going to be a bit different to what we’re used to. We’re going to have to be ready coming out of this break to play heaps and heaps of cricket.”
The South Africa-born Labuschagne is probably best prepared for such a scenario, having been adjudged the busiest cricketer in an ESPNcricinfo analysis last October.
The 25-year-old has been a revelation since stepping up as Steve Smith’s concussion substitute at Lord’s in last year’s Ashes series in England.
In the subsequent series against Pakistan and New Zealand, the right-hander smashed four centuries in five tests, including a maiden double hundred in Sydney earlier this year.
Labuschagne felt his Glamorgan stint helped him get better as a batsman and lamented not being able to reunite with the county as professional cricket remains suspended in England until at least July 1.
“I really enjoyed it last year. I loved Glamorgan, hence why I signed a two-year extension,” he said.
“It’s disappointing to see them and England cricket in trouble. It’s our responsibility, cricket on the whole, to make sure once this period is over that we get games on television and get the sport started again.

    <h5 class="mb-1">U.S. Soccer scores victory in equal pay suit with women's team players</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. women’s soccer team’s claims for equal pay were dismissed by a court on Friday, handing a victory to the United States Soccer Federation. 
Judge R. Gary Klausner of the United States District Court for the Central District of California threw out players’ claims that they were under paid in comparison with the men’s national team but allowed complaints of unfair medical, travel and training to proceed to trial.
“The WNT (Women’s National Team) has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the MNT (Men’s National Team) over the class period,” the court said in its summary judgment.
The judge, however, also ruled that players’ claims they do not receive equal treatment as the men when it comes to travel, training, housing and other areas could proceed.
The trial date is set for June 16.
Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the players, said that they plan to appeal the decision.
“We are shocked and disappointed,” said Levinson. “We will not give up our hard work for equal pay.
“We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.”
U.S. Soccer released a statement Friday saying it wanted to work with the team to “chart a positive path forward to grow the game both here at home and around the world.”
“U.S. Soccer has long been the world leader for the women’s game on and off the field and we are committed to continuing that work,” the federation said.
Players had been seeking $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act.
The women’s national team beat Netherlands to claim its fourth World Cup title last summer, as the stadium rang with chants of, “Equal Pay, Equal Pay,” catapulting its players into the spotlight.
Team co-captain Megan Rapinoe, who on Thursday appeared with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in a livestreamed event tweeted: “We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY.”
Forward Tobin Heath wrote on social media: “This team never gives up and we’re not going to start now.”
The U.S national team’s long-running feud with U.S. Soccer has been a very public and bitter battle with athletes and celebrities, from Billie Jean King to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rallying around the women’s cause.
Last month U.S. Soccer president Carlos Cordeiro resigned over language used in a court filing suggesting women possess less ability than men when it comes to soccer.
The language prompted an on-field protest by players, who wore their warmup jerseys inside out to obscure the U.S. Soccer logo prior to a game, and a critical response from several of the team’s commercial sponsors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US women's football team pledge to continue equal pay fight</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US women's football team has pledged to fight on in their battle for equal pay after a judge rejected their claim that they were being unfairly treated.
Players led by Alex Morgan had sued in March 2019, asking for more than $66m in damages under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In a 32-page decision Friday, US District Judge R Gary Klausner handed out a victory to the US Soccer Federation by throwing out players' claims that they were underpaid in comparison with the men's national team.
"The WNT (Women's National Team) has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the MNT (Men's National Team) over the class period," the court said in its summary judgement.
The judge, however, also ruled that players' claims they do not receive equal treatment as the men when it comes to travel, training, housing and other areas could proceed. The trial date is set for June 16.
Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the players, said they planned to appeal the decision.
"We are shocked and disappointed," said Levinson. "We will not give up our hard work for equal pay.
"We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender."
US Soccer released a statement on Friday saying it wanted to work with the team to "chart a positive path forward to grow the game both here at home and around the world".
"US Soccer has long been the world leader for the women's game on and off the field and we are committed to continuing that work," the federation said.
The women's national team beat the Netherlands 2-0 to claim their fourth World Cup title in July 2019, as the stadium rang with chants of, "Equal Pay, Equal Pay," catapulting its players into the spotlight.
Team co-captain Megan Rapinoe, who on Thursday appeared with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in a livestreamed event, tweeted: "We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY."
Forward Tobin Heath wrote on social media: "This team never gives up and we're not going to start now."
The US national team's long-running feud with US Soccer has been a very public and bitter battle, with athletes and celebrities, from Billie Jean King to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, rallying around the women's cause.
Last month, US Soccer President Carlos Cordeiro resigned over language used in a court filing suggesting women possess less ability than men when it comes to football.
The language prompted an on-field protest by players, who wore their warm-up jerseys inside out to obscure the US Soccer logo prior to a game, and a critical response from several of the team's commercial sponsors.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US Soccer scores victory in equal pay suit with women's team players</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK - The US women’s soccer team’s claims for equal pay were dismissed by a court on Friday, handing a victory to the United States Soccer Federation.
Judge R. Gary Klausner of the United States District Court for the Central District of California threw out players’ claims that they were underpaid in comparison with the men’s national team but allowed complaints of unfair medical, travel and training to proceed to trial.
“The WNT (Women’s National Team) has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the MNT (Men’s National Team) over the class period,” the court said in its summary judgment.
The judge, however, also ruled that players’ claims they do not receive equal treatment as the men when it comes to travel, training, housing and other areas could proceed.
The trial date is set for 16 June.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US women's soccer team lose case for equal pay</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US women's national soccer team (WNT) had their case for the same pay as their male counterparts rejected by a district court on Friday.
Judge R. Gary Klausner of the United States District Court for the Central District of California ruled in favor of the US Soccer Federation at the expense of the national team that won last year's women's World Cup, the tournament where the players highlighted their argument.
Judge Klausner rejected the players' claims that they were underpaid in comparison with the men's national team.
"The WNT has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the MNT (Men's National Team) over the class period," the court ruled.
The judge did, however, declare that the players do not receive equal treatment in terms of travel, training, housing and other areas. As a result, a trial on these claims could begin on June 16.
'We will never stop fighting for equality'
Regarding the equal pay decision, though, Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the players, said that they plan to appeal.
"We are shocked and disappointed," said Levinson. "We will not give up our hard work for equal pay. "We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender."
The footballers had been seeking $66 million (€59.5 million) in damages under the Equal Pay Act.
The US beat the Netherlands to claim its fourth World Cup title last summer, as the crowd in the stadium chanted: "Equal Pay, Equal Pay," catapulting its players into the spotlight.
Team co-captain Megan Rapinoe tweeted after the ruling: "We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Discus thrower Sandeep Kumari has been slapped with a four-year ban by the Athletics Integrity Unit for flunking a dope test, nearly two years after her sample was deemed clean by the NDTL.
The National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL) had failed to detect the banned substance -- a steroid -- which was present in her blood sample, collected by NADA officials during the National Inter-State Championships in June 2018 in Guwahati.
Kumari had won the gold with a throw of 58.41m.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) then decided to test the sample of Kumari at its Montreal Laboratory in Canada and it returned positive for anabolic steroid Metenolone in November 2018.
Explore Briefs
Kumari's results from June 26, 2018 to November 21, 2018 will now be annulled.
Her four-year ban, announced by WADA on Friday night, will begin from June 26, 2018 -- the date of her sample collection.
Not only Kumari's but samples of four other Indians, including 2017 Asian champion quarter-miler Nirmala Sheoran's had returned negative at NDTL but were found positive when tested in Montreal.
Jhuma Khatun, one of them, was also handed a four-year ban, last month.
WADA referred Kumari's results management to the AIU which notified her of the charges and provisionally suspended her in November 2018.
The Haryana athlete waived her right for the confirmatory 'B' sample test and accepted the adverse analytical finding (AAF).
In February 2019, Kumari participated in an interview with representatives of AIU by phone during which she confirmed that she admitted the Anti-Doping Rule Violations (ADRV).
In February 2020, the AIU issued a notice of charge to Kumari, asking her to either admit the ADRV or undergo a hearing before the Disciplinary Tribunal.
After missing three deadlines to respond, Kumari finally accepted the charge and did not request a hearing.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Olympic rower joins fight against coronavirus as junior doctor</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An Olympic rower has joined the fight against coronavirus as a junior doctor, while still training for the postponed games.
Olympic silver medallist Polly Swann started working as a junior doctor last week after previously completing her medical degree.
The 31-year-old won a silver medal as part of the women’s eight at the 2016 games in Rio de Janeiro.
She joined a hospital in Scotland to aid the fight against coronavirus last week, and will work there for the next three months.
Dr Swann said: “A lot of junior doctors have been moved to the most critical parts of the NHS, so interim foundation year doctors are backfilling their roles.
“I’m definitely not a frontline ICU worker, but I’m glad I can still help to ease the burden in some way.”
She added her coach Tom Pattichis has devised a training programme to prepare her for the Olympic games outside of her working hours.
“I had the experience of training alongside working when I was in my last few months of medical school last year so it’s not entirely new to me,” she said.
“I’m staying with my parents for lockdown so I have a rowing machine in their hallway, some dumbbells in the living room and a wattbike in my dad’s toolshed, which I’m sure is very annoying for them.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Coronavirus Scotland: Olympic rower joins the frontline as junior doctor at Scots hospital amid Covid-19 pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">An Olympic rower has joined the fight against coronavirus as a junior doctor, while still training for the postponed games.
Olympic silver medallist Polly Swann started working as a junior doctor last week after previously completing her medical degree.

The 31-year-old won a silver medal as part of the women's eight at the 2016 games in Rio de Janeiro.
After taking a break to finish her medical studies at the University of Edinburgh, she rejoined team GB in 2019, and won a bronze medal at the World Cup III in the paired race with teammate Holly Hill.
She joined a hospital in Scotland to aid the fight against coronavirus last week, and will work there for the next three months.
Dr Swann said: "A lot of junior doctors have been moved to the most critical
parts of the NHS, so interim foundation year doctors are backfilling their roles.
"I'm definitely not a frontline ICU worker, but I'm glad I can still help to ease the burden in some way."
She added her coach Tom Pattichis has devised a training programme to prepare her for the Olympic games outside of her working hours.
"I had the experience of training alongside working when I was in my last few months of medical school last year so it's not entirely new to me," she said.
"I'm staying with my parents for lockdown so I have a rowing machine in their hallway, some dumbbells in the living room and a wattbike in my dad's toolshed, which I'm sure is very annoying for them."
Dr Swann said the postponed games will be "the most phenomenal Olympics ever" after the world emerges from lockdown.
She said: "The Olympics is a celebration of human achievement and it brings people together - it's about more than just medals and more than even sport.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Greenwood has made the most of his first-team opportunities this term by scoring 12 times in 35 appearances, the majority of those coming from the bench.
The 18-year-old has earned high praise from boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, and strike partner Ighalo expects him to become an important figure for United in the coming years.
"He's very young and exciting. Very good player, left and right, he can shoot and score goals," he said during an Instagram live appearance.
"He's a player for the future for Man United. He's doing well now but in two or three years he is going to be doing very, very well."
Ighalo joined United on loan from Shanghai Shenhua in January and has been tipped to sign a permanent deal in the summer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Manchester United striker makes prediction for young Red Devils starlet</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Manchester United striker Odion Ighalo has made a bold prediction regarding United starlet Mason Greenwood, according to a report in the Mirror. 
Ighalo reckons that Greenwood will become a hugely important figure at the club in the next two or three seasons.
The 18-year-old Greenwood has already scored 12 goals for the Red Devils in what is his breakthrough season at Old Trafford and Ighalo reckons that the youngster will continue to improve and reach significant heights at the club.
Speaking about Greenwood and his future at United, in an Instagram live appearance, Ighalo said:
“He’s very young and exciting. Very good player, left and right, he can shoot and score goals,”
“He’s a player for the future for Man United. He’s doing well now but in two or three years he is going to be doing very, very well.” he added.
Greenwood has already drawn comparisons to fellow academy graduate and current United star forward Marcus Rashford.
While Ighalo who recently joined the Red Devils from the Chinese league in the January transfer window has reiterated that the youngster can compete at the highest level and become a key figure at Old Trafford.
Greenwood is only 18-years-old and has plenty of time to develop and he certainly has bags of potential and attributes that could take him to the very top of the game.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Odion Ighalo makes Mason Greenwood prediction for Man Utd fans</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Odion Ighalo predicts that Mason Greenwood will become a ‘very, very big’ player for Manchester United.
Greenwood was handed his first-team debut by Ole Gunnar Solskjaer this season, while this term the 18-year-old has scored 12 goals in 36 appearances.
Ighalo, meanwhile, joined United on in January and the Nigerian striker admits he has been impressed with what he has seen from Greenwood.
‘Greenwood is a very young and exciting player,’ Ighalo said during an Instagram live with Nana Aba Anamoah.
‘Very good player, can use both feet, left and right, he can shoot and score goals.
‘He’s a player for the future for Man United.
‘He’s doing well now but in two or three years you’ll see he is going to be doing so well, very, very big, because he’s a very good player.’
Ighalo also expects Paul Pogba to make an immediate impact at United when the World Cup winner returns from injury.
‘He’s a nice guy. A good player. He laughs with everybody. He’s a very good guy,’ said the striker.
‘Hopefully he will be back soon from his injury to hit the ground running.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Herschelle Gibbs to auction bat used in 434-run chase for coronavirus funds</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former South Africa batsman Herschelle Gibbs will auction the bat used during his team's record-breaking chase of 434 against Australia in 2006 to raise funds for fight against coronavirus.
Fourteen years ago, the Proteas had registered their name in record books when they chased down a monumental target of 434 runs in an ODI game played in Johannesburg on March 12. Gibbs had played an unbelievable knock of 175 as South Africa went across the line with one wicket in hand on the second last ball of what was a nail-biting contest.
"Supersport showing the 438 game. The bat I used that day will be up for auction to raise funds for Covid-19. Kept it all these years," Gibbs said in a tweet on Friday.
Mickey Arthur, who was South Africa's coach at that time, was quick to respond and said: "Good work Hersch.....that should be worth a bit!"Cricketers around the world have put up their respective equipments for auction to help generate funds for the needy during the Covid-19 pandemic which has so far claimed more than 2.3 lakh lives across the world.
Earlier Royal Challengers Bangalore teammates Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers announced they were giving away items from their historic 226-run stand against Gujarat Lions for auction.

    <h5 class="mb-1">COVID-19: Herschelle Gibbs shows up human side with auction of prized bat</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: Herschelle Gibbs, the former dashing South African opener, put his hand up in the country’s battle against COVID-19 when he decided to auction his most valuable possession from his cricketing career to raise funds for families affected by the pandemic. He is giving away the bat on auction with which he hit his career-best One Day International knock of 175 in South Africa’s historic chase on March 12, 2006, against Australia at the Wanderers ground in Johannesburg.
No cricketlover can ever forget this match as even today, it remains as the highest total chased by any team batting in an ODI and the world witnessed a score of 434 for four in 50 overs being chased successfully. Gibbs’s knock came off 111 balls, with 21 boundaries and seven sixes.
When I visited this ground in 2017 on an invitation from Cricket South Africa for the launch of their T20 Global League, I was fortunate to see the scoreboard of this match affixed on the walls of the pavilion. Though Australia’s Ricky Ponting hit 164 runs in that match, it was Gibbs who was the topscorer, which is still a world record.
As Gibbs’ international career came to an end by 2010, the chances of meeting this batsman who could thrash any bowling and talking to him became remote. However in 2018, he visited the UAE as the coach of the Rajputs team for the second edition of the T10 League and I approached Vijay Vyas, co-owner of the Rajputs team, for an interview with Gibbs.
When asked as to how he could hit the ball so comfortably and that for a long period of time, he said: “It is all technical and not just trying to hit the ball as high as you can. Frankly, you don’t have to hit the ball very hard. The timing of the stroke is what makes it look like some batsmen are doing an easy job.”
This prompted me to ask him more about his craft. Gibbs revealed that it was the challenge of playing the best bowlers in the world that helped him score runs. “Wasim Akram was the best and I felt privileged to play against bowlers like Shane Warne and Glenn McGrath. They all had variety and Shoaib Akhtar was the quickest that I’ve faced. It was lovely to get runs against those kinds of bowlers as they were the best in the business,” said the legend who had scored 8094 runs in One Day matches with 21 centuries and 37 half-centuries and was equally effective in Test cricket with 6167 runs including 14 centuries and 26 fifties.
Gibbs never hid his emotions and his autobiography is aptly titled “To the Point - The No Holds Barred autobiography”. He confessed all the wrong things he had done in his life through this book, but it also portrayed the warm and generous side of this genius who wears his heart on his sleeves.
Gibbs’ generous act of auctioning the bat is nothing but an extension of his real self.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Herschelle Gibbs to auction historic bat of South Africa’s record-breaking chase over Australia</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Herschelle Gibbs has decided to put the bat he used in the record-breaking run chase on auction to raise funds for families affected by the Covid-19pandemic. Gibbs helped South Africa create history on March 12, 2006, with his career-best 175, a record that still stands in the 50-over format.
The former South African cricketer posted a photo of his bat with a message written on it with the date of the match.
Gibbs came on to bat at No.3 in the run chase of 438 after opener Boeta Dippenar’s wicket in the second over. The explosive batsman shared a 187-run partnership with skipper Graeme Smith to keep the run chase alive. He did the bulk of the scoring in the third-wicket partnership with AB de Villiers who scored just 14 runs from 20 deliveries.
He got out in the 32nd over of the run chase after scoring 175 runs from 111 deliveries including 21 fours and seven sixes. South Africa chased down the total winning the match by one wicket with one ball to spare as wicketkeeper-batsman Mark Boucher scored the winning runs.
Over a decade later, the Cape Town-born cricketer revealed in his ‘To the Point: The No-holds barred Autobiography’ that he was nursing a hangover after a night of drinking just the previous day.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Why Australians' path to the Premier League has never been tougher</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A former Premier League head of recruitment believes it's now harder than ever for Australian soccer players to make it to the English top-flight. It's been more than a decade since the Socceroos' golden generation started to fade away and there's been few signs of a return to those halcyon days of the mid-to-late 2000s.
At the 2006 World Cup, nine of Australia's 23-man squad represented Premier League sides, with four others plying their trade in the Spanish La Liga and Serie A in Italy. In stark contrast, at last year's Asian Cup, Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan was the only player contracted to an EPL team, although Aaron Mooy, then of Huddersfield, would have been in the squad had it not been for injury.
There have been a string of theories put forward for the reason behind Australia's well of talent drying up. One is the decision of the FFA in 2017 to shut down the centre of excellence at the Australian Institute of Sport that produced the likes of Craig Moore, Vince Grella, Mark Viduka, Lucas Neill, Brett Emerton, Mark Bresciano, Vince Grella and John Aloisi.
Another is the replacement of home-grown coaches like Ron Smith and Steve O'Connor in Canberra more 10 years ago with ones from the Netherlands in a failed attempt to emulate the successful Dutch system.
Gary Penrice, former head of recruitment at Everton, Crystal Palace, Blackpool, QPR, Wigan and Stoke, who's just been appointed by Celtic, believes making the grade in England is tough, but not necessarily because of a lack of talent.
"Sometimes it just happens, a glut of really good players come through at once," Penrice said. "We're seeing it with Wales at the moment who have young kids like Daniel James now playing for Man United and Harry Wilson, who's on loan at Bournemouth from Liverpool.
"Who knows, in four years' time we could be talking about it happening again with Australia. But the football world is so vast nowadays. You now have players coming from so many different parts of the world to play in the Premier League."
There have been 51 Aussies who've played in the Premier League since its formation in 1992, which ranks only behind Brazil, Argentina and Nigeria for a non-European nation.
"There's always been lots of good players from Scandinavia and Australia but now you have players from countries like Liberia, Tanzania and Gabon, the net of talent is wider than ever," Penrice said. "I was at Palace when Mile Jedinak was there. A terrific guy, great pro and a real leader of men.
"You can say the same about Tim Cahill when I was at Everton. Both fantastic players, but also dependable, strong, good to have around your squad. That is always what Australian players have brought to a team."
Penrice said the progress of Mooy and Ryan shows good Aussies can still break through. "I first watched Mooy in a World Cup warm-up match against Czech Republic and he was the best player on the pitch," he said. "Clubs will always want to sign players like him and Ryan."
The improvement in young English talent has also hindered Aussie players in academy systems like Aiden O'Neill, on loan to Brisbane Roar from Burnley, making the grade like Kewell did at Leeds.
A change to the rules for overseas signings also means EPL clubs must now splash out to be guaranteed a work permit. Previously, a permit would be granted for any player who'd played 75 per cent of their country's international fixtures over three years. Now, only a player who costs STG10 million and earns STG30,000 a week will be given the green light under a points system.
"It's certainly made things harder," Penrice said. "It'll be interesting to see what happens with Australia. Young (Daniel) Arzani has been at Celtic, but he's not played much due to the injury he had. Arzani is Manchester City's player ... they obviously think he's got something to have signed him. But he needs to play games. I am guessing they'll loan him out again."
GOALKEEPER:
Mark Bosnich
Manchester United 1988-91, 1999-01, Aston Villa 1992-99, Chelsea 2001-02
Appearances: 273
Hard to split Bosnich and Mark Schwarzer, but the Sydneysider's brilliance during a six-year spell for teams competing for honours gives him the edge. Villa were a frequent top-four challenger with 'Bozza' between the sticks, won two cups and regularly played in Europe. He returned to United to win the EPL in 2000 before off-field dramas ultimately ended his career. Although it tainted his legacy, there's no disputing, at his pomp, Bosnich was among the finest keepers in Britain.
DEFENDERS:
Brett Emerton
Blackburn Rovers 2003-2011
Appearances: 294
Goals: 20
The $A4.8 million spent by Blackburn on Emerton is regarded as one of the best value-for-money signings in the club's history. Marked his debut with a goal and an assist and became one of the EPL's best attacking full-backs. Respected for his low maintenance attitude off the field too, Emerton appeared in two FA Cups and a League Cup semi-final. He was also part of a squad that qualified twice for the Europa League.
Lucas Neill
Millwall 1995-2001, Blackburn '01-07, West Ham '07-'09, Everton, 09-10, Watford, Doncaster 2014.
Appearances: 514
Goals: 22
Confident, abrasive, consistent. Three words that best describe Neill's stellar 19-year career in England. After six seasons at Millwall he became a Premier League player with Blackburn in 2001. The right-back's good form often saw him linked with a move to a top-four club. However, he turned down Liverpool in 2007 to join West Ham for a reported $150,000 a week. After three good seasons he left to join Everton only to depart after six months. After spells in Turkey and the A-League he joined Watford then Doncaster in 2014 before retiring after missing out on the World Cup.
Craig Moore
Glasgow Rangers 1993-98, '99-05, Crystal Palace 1998-'99, Newcastle 2005-07.
Appearances: 306
Goals: 20
A classy centre-back with a touch of steel, Moore enjoyed a trophy-laden 12-year stint with Rangers where he cemented his place in an outstanding side that featured regularly in the Champions League and won the Scottish treble in 2003. Newcastle gave Moore the chance to play in the Premier League in 2005 and he impressed the St James' Park crowd. However, injuries limited him to just 30 games in two years.
Joe Marston
Club: Preston North End 1950-55
Appearances: 185
The pioneering Sydneysider was the defensive linchpin in a fine Preston team. Signed in 1950, Marston was not only the first Australian to play in England but also the FA Cup final. He was a key man in the team that were denied the 1953 First Division title on goal average. Finished his career at Deepdale by being serenaded from the field to the tune of Waltzing Matilda. Named one of the club's six greatest-ever players last year.
MIDFIELDERS:
Craig Johnston
Clubs: Middlesbrough 1977-81, Liverpool 1981-1988
Number of all competition appearances: 335
Goals: 56
An outstanding attacking midfielder and a regular member of a magnificent Liverpool side in the early 1980s. What he lacked in technical ability, he made up for with an eye for goal, pace and power. Despite an outgoing personality, Johnston was constantly wracked with self-doubt and even went as far to claim he was the worst player in a fantastic team. He wasn't.
Mile Jedinak
Crystal Palace 2011-16, Aston Villa 2016-19
Appearances: 257
Goals: 12
Robbie Slater became the first Australian to win a Premier League title in 1995 at Blackburn and enjoyed spells at West Ham and Southampton. However, he's edged out by former Socceroos skipper Jedinak. The defensive midfielder was an inspirational captain at Palace and played a significant role in their promotion to the EPL in 2014. After helping them stay there, he led the Eagles out for the 2016 FA Cup final. Joined Villa later that year and won promotion again in 2019.
Tim Cahill
Millwall 1998-2004, 2019; Everton 2004-2012
Appearances: 453
Goals: 108
In addition to being a Socceroos great, Cahill is held in similarly-high esteem at Millwall and Everton. Signed for just $A3.8 million by the Toffees, in an eight-year stint he regularly topped their scoring charts. Scored in three successive World Cups for Australia and joined some exalted company by appearing in his fourth in 2018.
Stan Lazaridis
West Ham 1995-99, Birmingham City 1999-2006
Appearances: 260
Goals: 11
The flying left-winger endured a mixed time during his spell with West Ham, but found his feet at Birmingham where he became a huge crowd favourite. Scored a penalty in a shoot-out win that earned EPL promotion in 2002, ending a 17-year top-flight absence.
STRIKERS:
Harry Kewell
Leeds United 1996-2003; Liverpool 2003-2008
Appearances: 274
Goals: 56
The most naturally-talented player produced by Australia. Injuries blighted the attacker's Liverpool career, forcing him off during the 2005 Champions League and 2006 FA Cup finals. It was at Leeds where his star shone brightest in a brilliant side that reached the 2001 Champions League semi-final. However, some disparaging comments when he left for Anfield and a later move to Galatasaray tarnished his reputation with Leeds fans.
Mark Viduka
Leeds United 2000-2004 Middlesbrough 2004-07, Newcastle 2007-09
Appearances: 240
Goals: 62
Scored 30 goals in 37 games for Celtic before joining Leeds where he etched his named in club folklore by smashing four goals past Liverpool. Unlike Kewell, he is still revered at Elland Road. Viduka was a top-class striker blessed with an immaculate first touch, aerial ability and was a great finisher. Also enjoyed good success at Middlesbrough where he spearheaded their run to the Europa League final. Joined Newcastle in 2007 but injuries blighted his two years at the club.

DEFENDERS:
Brett Emerton
Blackburn Rovers 2003-2011
Appearances: 294
Goals: 20
The $A4.8 million spent by Blackburn on Emerton is regarded as one of the best value-for-money signings in the club's history. Marked his debut with a goal and an assist and became one of the EPL's best attacking full-backs. Respected for his low maintenance attitude off the field too, Emerton appeared in two FA Cups and a League Cup semi-final. He was also part of a squad that qualified twice for the Europa League.
Lucas Neill
Millwall 1995-2001, Blackburn '01-07, West Ham '07-'09, Everton, 09-10, Watford, Doncaster 2014.
Appearances: 514
Goals: 22
Confident, abrasive, consistent. Three words that best describe Neill's stellar 19-year career in England. After six seasons at Millwall he became a Premier League player with Blackburn in 2001. The right-back's good form often saw him linked with a move to a top-four club. However, he turned down Liverpool in 2007 to join West Ham for a reported $150,000 a week. After three good seasons he left to join Everton only to depart after six months. After spells in Turkey and the A-League he joined Watford then Doncaster in 2014 before retiring after missing out on the World Cup.
Craig Moore
Glasgow Rangers 1993-98, '99-05, Crystal Palace 1998-'99, Newcastle 2005-07.
Appearances: 306
Goals: 20
A classy centre-back with a touch of steel, Moore enjoyed a trophy-laden 12-year stint with Rangers where he cemented his place in an outstanding side that featured regularly in the Champions League and won the Scottish treble in 2003. Newcastle gave Moore the chance to play in the Premier League in 2005 and he impressed the St James' Park crowd. However, injuries limited him to just 30 games in two years.
Joe Marston
Club: Preston North End 1950-55
Appearances: 185
The pioneering Sydneysider was the defensive linchpin in a fine Preston team. Signed in 1950, Marston was not only the first Australian to play in England but also the FA Cup final. He was a key man in the team that were denied the 1953 First Division title on goal average. Finished his career at Deepdale by being serenaded from the field to the tune of Waltzing Matilda. Named one of the club's six greatest-ever players last year.
MIDFIELDERS:
Craig Johnston
Clubs: Middlesbrough 1977-81, Liverpool 1981-1988
Number of all competition appearances: 335
Goals: 56
An outstanding attacking midfielder and a regular member of a magnificent Liverpool side in the early 1980s. What he lacked in technical ability, he made up for with an eye for goal, pace and power. Despite an outgoing personality, Johnston was constantly wracked with self-doubt and even went as far to claim he was the worst player in a fantastic team. He wasn't.
Mile Jedinak
Crystal Palace 2011-16, Aston Villa 2016-19
Appearances: 257
Goals: 12
Robbie Slater became the first Australian to win a Premier League title in 1995 at Blackburn and enjoyed spells at West Ham and Southampton. However, he's edged out by former Socceroos skipper Jedinak. The defensive midfielder was an inspirational captain at Palace and played a significant role in their promotion to the EPL in 2014. After helping them stay there, he led the Eagles out for the 2016 FA Cup final. Joined Villa later that year and won promotion again in 2019.
Tim Cahill
Millwall 1998-2004, 2019; Everton 2004-2012
Appearances: 453
Goals: 108
In addition to being a Socceroos great, Cahill is held in similarly-high esteem at Millwall and Everton. Signed for just $A3.8 million by the Toffees, in an eight-year stint he regularly topped their scoring charts. Scored in three successive World Cups for Australia and joined some exalted company by appearing in his fourth in 2018.
Stan Lazaridis
West Ham 1995-99, Birmingham City 1999-2006
Appearances: 260
Goals: 11
The flying left-winger endured a mixed time during his spell with West Ham, but found his feet at Birmingham where he became a huge crowd favourite. Scored a penalty in a shoot-out win that earned EPL promotion in 2002, ending a 17-year top-flight absence.
STRIKERS:
Harry Kewell
Leeds United 1996-2003; Liverpool 2003-2008
Appearances: 274
Goals: 56
The most naturally-talented player produced by Australia. Injuries blighted the attacker's Liverpool career, forcing him off during the 2005 Champions League and 2006 FA Cup finals. It was at Leeds where his star shone brightest in a brilliant side that reached the 2001 Champions League semi-final. However, some disparaging comments when he left for Anfield and a later move to Galatasaray tarnished his reputation with Leeds fans.
Mark Viduka
Leeds United 2000-2004 Middlesbrough 2004-07, Newcastle 2007-09
Appearances: 240
Goals: 62
Scored 30 goals in 37 games for Celtic before joining Leeds where he etched his named in club folklore by smashing four goals past Liverpool. Unlike Kewell, he is still revered at Elland Road. Viduka was a top-class striker blessed with an immaculate first touch, aerial ability and was a great finisher. Also enjoyed good success at Middlesbrough where he spearheaded their run to the Europa League final. Joined Newcastle in 2007 but injuries blighted his two years at the club.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Aussies’ path to the EPL harder than ever</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A former Premier League head of recruitment believes it’s now harder than ever for Australian soccer players to make it to the English top-flight.
It’s been over a decade since the Socceroos’ golden generation started to fade away and there’s been few signs of a return to those halcyon days of the mid-to-late 2000s.
At the 2006 World Cup, nine of Australia’s 23-man squad represented Premier League sides with four others plying their trade in the Spanish La Liga and Serie A in Italy.
In stark contrast, at last year’s Asian Cup, Brighton goalkeeper Mat Ryan was the only player contracted to an EPL team, although Aaron Mooy, then of Huddersfield, would have been in the squad had it not been for injury.
There have been a string of theories put forward for the reason behind Australia’s well of talent drying up.
One, is the decision of the FFA in 2017 to shut down the centre of excellence at the Australian Institute of Sport that produced the likes of Craig Moore, Vince Grella, Mark Viduka, Lucas Neill, Brett Emerton, Mark Bresciano, Vince Grella and John Aloisi.
Another is the replacement of home-grown coaches like Ron Smith and Steve O’Connor in Canberra over 10 years ago with ones from the Netherlands in a failed attempt to emulate the successful Dutch system.
Gary Penrice, former head of recruitment at Everton, Crystal Palace, Blackpool, QPR, Wigan and Stoke, who’s just been appointed by Celtic, believes making the grade in England is tough, but not necessarily because of a lack of talent.
“Sometimes it just happens, a glut of really good players come through at once,” Penrice told AAP.
“We’re seeing it with Wales at the moment who have young kids like Daniel James now playing for Man United and Harry Wilson, who’s on loan at Bournemouth from Liverpool.
“Who knows, in four years time we could be talking about it happening again with Australia. But the football world is so vast nowadays.
“You now have players coming from so many different parts of the world to play in the Premier League.”
There have been 51 Aussies who’ve played in the Premier League since its formation in 1992, which ranks only behind Brazil, Argentina and Nigeria for a non-European nation.
“There’s always been lots of good players from Scandinavia and Australia but now you have players from countries like Liberia, Tanzania and Gabon, the net of talent is wider than ever,” Penrice said.
“I was at Palace when Mile Jedinak was there. A terrific guy, great pro and a real leader of men.
“You can say the same about Tim Cahill when I was at Everton.
“Both fantastic players, but also dependable, strong, good to have around your squad. That is always what Australian players have brought to a team.”
Penrice said the progress of Mooy and Ryan shows good Aussies can still break through.
“I first watched Mooy in a World Cup warm-up match against Czech Republic and he was the best player on the pitch.
“Clubs will always want to sign players like him and Ryan.”
The improvement in young English talent has also hindered Aussie players in academy systems like Aiden O’Neill, on loan to Brisbane Roar from Burnley, making the grade like Kewell did at Leeds.
A change to the rules for overseas signings also means EPL clubs must now splash out to be guaranteed a work permit.
Previously, a permit would be granted for any player who’d played 75 per cent of their country’s international fixtures over three years.
Now, only a player who costs £10 million and earns £30,000 a week will be given the green light under a points system.
“It’s certainly made things harder,” Penrice said.
“It’ll be interesting to see what happens with Australia.
“Young (Daniel) Arzani has been at Celtic, but he he’s not played much due to the injury he had.
“Arzani is Manchester City’s player … they obviously think he’s got something to have signed him.
“But he needs to play games. I am guessing they’ll loan him out again.”

For the duration of the postponed World Championships, the PA news agency is turning its focus on the Crucible characters who never quite made the competition’s last three days.
The 34-year-old from Northern Ireland has cut a controversial figure on the circuit since his World Championship debut in 2007, but is yet to summon a Crucible performance to put his off-table antics in the shade.
Allen has, variously, sparked a feud with Stuart Bingham after claiming his opponent had “no bottle”, engaged in a running battle with Barry Hearn over changes to the snooker calendar, and set about taking on a few billion Chinese snooker aficionados single-handedly.
During the 2012 World Open in Haikou, Allen sent an infamous and swiftly deleted tweet in which he derided the tournament and its associated facilities.
At the World Championships in the same year, Allen branded opponent Cao Yupeng a “cheat” for not calling a foul, and broadened the subject of his ire by adding: “It seems to be a bit of a trait for the Chinese players.”
A fresh-faced Allen had reached the Crucible semi-finals on his third appearance in 2009, including an epic second round win over Ronnie O’Sullivan, and has featured in three more subsequent last eights.
But despite winning five ranking tournaments, reaching the UK Championships final and claiming a breakthrough Masters title in 2018, his inconsistency has cost him dear.
Entering the Crucible just months after his Masters triumph and with his time seemingly set to arrive, he was dumped out in the first round by Zhou Yuelong. – of China.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In-demand Leipzig star Timo Werner must make careful choice - Rangnick</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Timo Werner should think long and hard about whether a move away from RB Leipzig might reduce his playing opportunities, according to Ralf Rangnick.
Former Leipzig head coach Rangnick, who now works for the club's owners, Red Bull as head of sport and development, would welcome Werner staying put and remaining in the Bundesliga.
But Rangnick says the Germany striker is not irreplaceable and predicted Leipzig would be able to cope should Werner decide to leave at the end of this season.
Liverpool are among the clubs who have been linked with the in-demand 24-year-old, who indicated in recent days that he would rather move abroad than join potential suitors Bayern Munich.
"I know his family and that of his girlfriend and his agent very well," Rangnick said.
"He has continued to develop, especially in terms of his strike rate, and could take another leap under [Leipzig coach] Julian Nagelsmann and his colleagues. I would be happy if he stayed."
Speaking to German newspaper Mitteldeutsche Zeitung, Rangnick added: "In my opinion, RB Leipzig are so well positioned that he can be replaced.
"Timo will carefully consider whether he has the opportunity to play as regularly as is the case here at another club."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Timo Werner gets transfer advice as Liverpool move put on hold</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Timo Werner has been warned that a summer move away from RB Leipzig might not be in his best interests, after Liverpool shelved plans to move for him in 2020.
Germany international Werner has long been a target of the Reds, but Mirror Sport revealed on Friday that the Premier League leaders are reassessing their moves in the summer transfer market amid the current coronavirus crisis.
The subsequent economic impact of the pandemic on football and wider society is likely to see many big-money moves cancelled or put on hold, leaving Werner in limbo as he looked to leave the Bundesliga club this summer.
Whether the Reds come in for him again or not, Leipzig sporting director and former coach Ralf Rangnick says that a move may still not be in Werner's best interests as the grass isn't always greener on any other side.
"I know his family and that of his girlfriend and his agent very well," Rangnick told German newspaper Mitteldeutsche Zeitung, via Goal.com.
"He has continued to develop, especially in terms of his strike rate, and could take another leap under [Leipzig's current head coach] Julian Nagelsmann and his colleagues. I would be happy if he stayed.
"In my opinion, RB Leipzig are so well positioned that he can be replaced. Timo will carefully consider whether he has the opportunity to play as regularly as is the case here at another club."
Werner has also been linked with moves to Manchester United and Chelsea, while Liverpool might come in for him again in 2021 should he opt to stay at Leipzig.
The coronavirus pandemic is also set to end any hopes the Reds had of signing Lyon's Houssem Aouar, another summer 2020 target.

    <h5 class="mb-1">"Bayern? I'm better going abroad"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Timo Werner made surprising comments to 'Bild' ruling out a move to Bayern Munich. He said he would prefer to go to a foreign club.
Timo Werner's future, which seemed to lie anywhere but Leipzig, could actually lie in the city in Eastern Germany. Clubs like Liverpool, who are very interested in signing him, may not be able to make new signings because of the effects of the coronavirus, so the striker has got less options.
Bayernusually snap up the best players from the rest of the German teams and are also interested in the player, but it seems like Werner is not too keen on the idea.
In a chat with 'Bild', Werner admitted that he would prefer to go to a foreign club than the German giants. "They are a great club, we don't need to talk about that. And Flick has shown that he is a very good coach. But if I were to move, I'd rather move abroad than to Bayern," the Germany international surprised told the paper.

"A challenge in a different competition would interest me more than a move to another Bundesliga club. It's also important I like and have a good relationship with the club. I choose RB Leipzig for that reason and it's something I will always have in mind," Werner continued.
Although he had already shown his class in the past, Timo Werner has shone in the 2019-20 season. When the campaign was halted, the forward had 27 goals and 12 assists, his best ever tally for a season.

    <h5 class="mb-1">RB Leipzig forward Timo Werner confirms desire to move abroad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Having starred for Leipzig in Germany's top flight and the Champions League this season, Werner has been heavily linked with a future switch to Liverpool or Chelsea.
While Bayern Munich are also said to be in the mix for the attacker, Werner has suggested that he will likely sign for a foreign club when he leaves Leipzig.
Speaking to Bild, the 24-year-old said: "Bayern is a great club, we don't need to talk about it, and Hansi Flick has proven this season that he's a really good head coach.
"But if a change should ever become an issue, I would rather take a step abroad than switch to Bavaria. It's just that the challenge in another league would appeal to me a little more than a change within the Bundesliga."
Although Werner has a contract until 2023, a release clause in the region of £51m is said to be present in his existing deal.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Werner says ‘foreign league would appeal’ more than Bayern switch in clear come-get-me plea</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Timo Werner’s rumoured move to Liverpool is on the rocks because of the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the world.
The German international was seemingly set to make Anfield his new home this summer, but everything is now uncertain.
The pandemic has disrupted football in a way that money is now almost un-quantifiable, but that hasn’t stopped Werner from doing his best to let Liverpool know he wants them.
According to German football writer Christian Falk, the Leipzig man is quoted as saying: “A challenge in a foreign league would appeal to me rather than a move to Bayern.”
Italian reporter Fabrizio Romano added to this by saying the Reds are ‘always working to get him’ because Jurgen Klopp ‘strongly wants him’.
But any move has reportedly been put on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Daily Mirror journalist Dave Maddock.
While the Premier League looks likely to resume eventually, it’s not a certainty and that means clubs can’t bank on money coming in or not going out.
Broadcasters would be seeking reimbursements, if the season is unable to be played out and this would be bad news for any club that doesn’t have tens of millions lying around.
In the case of in non-completion, the Premier League – and its shareholders – are likely to be slapped with a financial hit of close to £1billion by Sky and BT.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lionel Messi is not a natural goalscorer, claims Tim Sherwood</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Lionel Messi is not a natural goalscorer, according to former Tottenham and Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood.
The Argentine has scored 627 goals in 718 appearances for Barcelona, while he has 70 goals in 138 games for his national side.
Messi is widely regarded as one of the best players of all time and arguably the greatest natural talent in football.
But Sherwood insists there is no such thing as ‘natural talent’ and claims Messi is only one of the world’s best because ‘he’s dribbled a stone round an alleyway’.
‘I would take attitude over ability all day,’ Sherwood said in an interview with MailOnline.
‘If you can marry the two up, then you’ve got a serious footballer. I hate it when I hear pundits talking about ‘natural talent’. There’s no such thing.
‘That’s physical. I don’t buy that there are natural goalscorers. Lionel Messi is what he is because he’s dribbled a stone round an alleyway and his brothers have been kicking s*** out of him for five years.
‘It’s nurture. You aren’t just born like that.’
Sherwood has also told Harry Kane to assess Tottenham’s transfer business in the next window before making a decision over his future.
‘It’s like Alan Shearer. He finishes fourth with Blackburn [in 1992-93], then second [in 1993-94],’ said Sherwood.
‘Manchester United are all over him. But he decides to stay, because he believes we have the quality to win it, and we did the next season.
‘Harry needs to assess this himself. I would wait to see what they do in the summer.
‘They’ve got a manager who has not gone there to only finish inside the top four. Harry will know very soon if the club are willing to spend that money to give themselves that opportunity of winning the league.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi told he is 'not a natural goalscorer'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Tim Sherwood has insisted that Lionel Messi's vast achievements are down to hard work rather than natural talent, with the former Tottenham Hotspur manager claiming that the Barcelona legend is not a "natural goalscorer".
Messi is considered by many to be the greatest player of all time and he has scored 627 career goals in 718 appearances for the Spanish giants.
The Argentinian also boasts a remarkable record in La Liga of nearly a goal per game thanks to his 438 goals in 474 appearances.
However, former Tottenham Hotspur and Aston Villa boss Sherwood claims there is no such thing as "natural talent" and believes Messi's success is due to hard work.
"I don't buy that there are natural goalscorers," Sherwood told the Daily Mail. "Lionel Messi is what he is because he's dribbled a stone round an alleyway and his brothers have been kicking s*** out of him for five years.
"It's nurture. You aren't just born like that."
The former England international also insisted that a hardworking attitude is far more important for a footballer than natural ability.

He added: "I would take attitude over ability all day. If you can marry the two up, then you've got a serious footballer.
"I hate it when I hear pundits talking about 'natural talent'. There's no such thing."
As a player, Sherwood was part of the Blackburn Rovers side which won the 1994-95 Premier League and he made three appearances for England.
The former Spurs midfielder returned to White Hart Lane as manager in 2013 but was sacked after six months. A brief spell with Villa followed in 2015 and Sherwood led the club to the FA Cup final, where they were beaten by Arsenal.
Sherwood's most recent role was as director of football at Swindon Town, which he left in 2017.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Lionel Messi is not a natural goalscorer, former Tottenham boss Tim Sherwood says</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">- Lionel Messi has been praised for his hard work by former Spurs boss Tim Sherwood
- The 51-year-old believes Messi’s abilities were all down to his work rate
- More outrageously, Sherwood claimed Messi was not a natural goalscorer after recording 627 goals in 718 career appearances
Lionel Messi's rivalry with Cristiano Ronaldo is one that will not go away easily even after both stars have retired from the game.
The superstars have been on top of their games in over 15 years - winning individual as well as collective accolades with their respective clubs.
One thing which fans always seem to agree on in the debate is the clear distinction in the players' success stories.
Many argue that the two are virtually impossible to compare and contrast because of the simple fact that they have quite different styles of play.

In fact, fans argue that Messi is more of a natural talent while Ronaldo is a work machine who toiled to become the powerhouse fans know and love today.
However, former Tottenham Hotspur manager Tim Sherwood does not buy that narrative, saying: “there is no such thing as natural talent.”
Sherwood told Daily Mail that Messi’s success was all down to hard work, as is the case with many successful people around the world.
More outrageously, the former Aston Villa boss went on to suggest Messi’s goal-scoring prowess was also not natural and he had to learn majority of his skills like everybody else.
“I don’t but that there are natural goalscorers. Lionel Messi is what he is because he’s dribbed stone round an alleyway and his brothers have been taunting him for years,” Sherwood analysed.
“It’s nurture. You aren’t just born like that.

According to the former England international, having an elite mentality was far more important than the so-called natural talent and he insisted Messi and Ronaldo had plenty of that.
“I would take attitude over ability all day. If you can marry the two up, then you have a serious footballer,” he went on.

As far as Lionel Messi is concerned, his numbers are quite mystical as he currently boasts 627 career goals from 718 appearances.
In La Liga, he has an impossible goal-per-game ratio where averages nearly a goal in every game as he has scored 438 times in 474 appearances in the league.
Legit.ng earlier reported that Lionel Messi's value in the transfer market has tumbled owing to the economic crisis caused by the outbreak of deadly coronavirus.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ex-Premier League boss shockingly claims Lionel Messi isn’t a ‘natural’ goalscorer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Premier League player and manager Tim Sherwood has shockingly claimed in an interview with ex-teammate Chris Sutton for the Mail that Barcelona great Lionel Messi is not a ‘natural’ goalscorer.
After hailing the attitude of Tottenham talisman Harry Kane, Sherwood claimed that ‘there’s no such thing’ as ‘natural talent’.
Whilst Sherwood hints that Messi’s superstar abilities are down to his hard work, it seems strange to not credit the six-time Ballon d’Or winner’s talents to a ‘natural’ ability.
Messi must have at least some level of ‘natural’ goalscoring ability if he’s so far ahead of the rest of the competition.
Cristiano Ronaldo is the only player of this generation that comes close to him – and he’s one of the most hard-working athletes ever.
Here’s what was said, quotes obtained from the Mail:
Sherwood (TS): “I would take attitude over ability all day. If you can marry the two up, then you’ve got a serious footballer. I hate it when I hear pundits talking about ‘natural talent’. There’s no such thing.”
Chris Sutton: “Surely you have players born with naturally athletic gifts?”
TS: “That’s physical. I don’t buy that there are natural goalscorers.”
“Lionel Messi is what he is because he’s dribbled a stone round an alleyway and his brothers have been kicking s*** out of him for five years. It’s nurture. You aren’t just born like that.”
Messi is widely regarded as one of the best footballers of all-time, with the ace boasting a phenomenal record of 627 goals in 718 games for Barcelona.
The 32-year-old has also bagged 70 goals for the Argentina national team.
Sherwood’s point is flawed even we disregard his comments regarding Messi, the notion that there are no ‘natural goalscorers’ is quite and outlandish stance for the former Spurs boss to take.
Are some of this century’s best goalscorers like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Wayne Rooney, Samuel Eto’o, Ronaldo Nazario and Thierry Henry not seen as players with a natural eye for goal by most football fans?
Sherwood’s former Blackburn teammate Alan Shearer – the Premier League’s all-time leading goalscorer, is perhaps England’s best example ever of a prolific ‘natural’ scorer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Almost 10 years as a Spur but Patty Mills knows NBA will be much changed when play returns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Patty Mills has had a taste of normal home life during the most abnormal of times. But he also knows when he returns to life in the NBA, things will be greatly changed.
Mills has spent the COVID-19 pandemic at home in San Antonio, Texas with his wife Alyssa and their dog, where he has been training hard albeit without a hoop to shoot on.
San Antonio is under a "stay-at-home" order and Bexar County, with a population of around two million people, had recorded 44 deaths from a little over 1307 cases as of Saturday (AEST).
"I think we [San Antonio] have done a pretty reasonable job of following the rules from the mayor and the city," Mills told The Age from San Antonio.
"You try to focus on the bright side and that is while this is a large city, it’s still feels like a small community with the way people look after one another."
The NBA season remains suspended with the league working on how it could resume, with options including moving all teams or those still in playoff-contention to Disney World in Orlando or Las Vegas to play out the season without fans in July or August.
When the NBA stopped, Mills and his 12th-placed San Antonio Spurs were four games behind the eighth-placed Memphis Grizzlies in the western conference with 19 games left in their season.
Whether time allows for the Spurs to have a chance at playing for a place in the post-season, or whether the league goes right into the play-offs, is to be decided.
But Mills understands the pandemic will change the NBA as so much of NBA life revolves around air travel, hotels, close human interaction and visiting busy public places.
"It's the road trips, the public interactions where something like this has brought us back to how much public access we do," Mills said.
"You think about how much of that we have as professional athletes have - airplanes, buses, hotels - it's going to be different. There is no question about that.
"Everyone is going to be cautious and different strategies will be put in place as everyone develops the best way to attack this thing and figure out the best way to deal with it - assuming that it will come back [in full] next year.
"This will have a major effect on how the NBA is run for a long time probably."
What will keep Mills on track regardless of how long the NBA is off court is his fourth Olympics next year, and a personal milestone as next season will be his 10th with the Spurs.
No Australian player has spent 10 campaigns playing for a single NBA team and it's rare for someone to have a long tenure with a team unless you are a superstar like a Kobe Bryant or a Tim Duncan.
Mills is proud to not only be a leader and a bridge between the Spurs team who won the 2013-2014 NBA title and the next generation of players, but also as being an Australian who has turned San Antonio into his second home.
"It is kind of amazing," Mills said. "I never would have thought I'd be a part of an organisation like this, let alone be approaching 10 years. I mean 11-12 years in the league is unheard of for someone like me so you never take it for granted.
"But you know, San Antonio is definitely a real special place for me, the family, the missus and the dog ever since we've been here."
Mills arrived at San Antonio late in the 2011-12 season desperate to prove himself and prepare for the London Olympics with then Spurs assistant coach and Boomers coach Brett Brown.
The decade since has seen Mills enrich his life and his basketball career with the club and form a bond with his teammates, coach Gregg Popovich and the whole city.
"I say this with all honesty when I step out on the floor here in San Antonio with this silver and black, it's turned into that same feeling that I get, you know, playing playing for the green and gold and playing for Australia," Mills said.
"That's unheard of in a whole lot of places. So it's definitely become a very special place for me both on and off the court."
Next season Mills will be in the last year of his four-year deal, so you could never rule out a trade or someone looking to pry Mills from the Spurs should they still be out of the play-off mix.
But Mills still feels the need to prove himself and wants to take on the challenge of leading the team back into contention.
He aims to keep showing that when the Spurs return, especially after the club helped him source extra gym equipment for his house so he can continue workouts.
"With people not being able to play basketball during this break, it will be tough but we are in the NBA for a reason and have developed a lot of muscle memory," Mills said. "So although it might be ugly for a bit but it won't take us long to hit our stride and get back to it."

"With people not being able to play basketball during this break, it will be tough but we are in the NBA for a reason and have developed a lot of muscle memory," Mills said. "So although it might be ugly for a bit but it won't take us long to hit our stride and get back to it."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Almost 10 years as a Spur but Patty Mills knows NBA will be much changed when play returns</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Patty Mills has had a taste of normal home life during the most abnormal of times. But he also knows when he returns to life in the NBA, things will be greatly changed.
Mills has spent the COVID-19 pandemic at home in San Antonio, Texas with his wife Alyssa and their dog, where he has been training hard albeit without a hoop to shoot on.
San Antonio is under a "stay-at-home" order and Bexar County, with a population of around two million people, had recorded 44 deaths from a little over 1307 cases as of Saturday (AEST).
"I think we [San Antonio] have done a pretty reasonable job of following the rules from the mayor and the city," Mills told The Age from San Antonio.
"You try to focus on the bright side and that is while this is a large city, it’s still feels like a small community with the way people look after one another."
The NBA season remains suspended with the league working on how it could resume, with options including moving all teams or those still in playoff-contention to Disney World in Orlando or Las Vegas to play out the season without fans in July or August.
When the NBA stopped, Mills and his 12th-placed San Antonio Spurs were four games behind the eighth-placed Memphis Grizzlies in the western conference with 19 games left in their season.
Whether time allows for the Spurs to have a chance at playing for a place in the post-season, or whether the league goes right into the play-offs, is to be decided.
But Mills understands the pandemic will change the NBA as so much of NBA life revolves around air travel, hotels, close human interaction and visiting busy public places.
"It's the road trips, the public interactions where something like this has brought us back to how much public access we do," Mills said.
"You think about how much of that we have as professional athletes have - airplanes, buses, hotels - it's going to be different. There is no question about that.
"Everyone is going to be cautious and different strategies will be put in place as everyone develops the best way to attack this thing and figure out the best way to deal with it - assuming that it will come back [in full] next year.
"This will have a major effect on how the NBA is run for a long time probably."
What will keep Mills on track regardless of how long the NBA is off court is his fourth Olympics next year, and a personal milestone as next season will be his 10th with the Spurs.
No Australian player has spent 10 campaigns playing for a single NBA team and it's rare for someone to have a long tenure with a team unless you are a superstar like a Kobe Bryant or a Tim Duncan.
Mills is proud to not only be a leader and a bridge between the Spurs team who won the 2013-2014 NBA title and the next generation of players, but also as being an Australian who has turned San Antonio into his second home.
"It is kind of amazing," Mills said. "I never would have thought I'd be a part of an organisation like this, let alone be approaching 10 years. I mean 11-12 years in the league is unheard of for someone like me so you never take it for granted.
"But you know, San Antonio is definitely a real special place for me, the family, the missus and the dog ever since we've been here."
Mills arrived at San Antonio late in the 2011-12 season desperate to prove himself and prepare for the London Olympics with then Spurs assistant coach and Boomers coach Brett Brown.
The decade since has seen Mills enrich his life and his basketball career with the club and form a bond with his teammates, coach Gregg Popovich and the whole city.
"I say this with all honesty when I step out on the floor here in San Antonio with this silver and black, it's turned into that same feeling that I get, you know, playing playing for the green and gold and playing for Australia," Mills said.
"That's unheard of in a whole lot of places. So it's definitely become a very special place for me both on and off the court."
Next season Mills will be in the last year of his four-year deal, so you could never rule out a trade or someone looking to pry Mills from the Spurs should they still be out of the play-off mix.
But Mills still feels the need to prove himself and wants to take on the challenge of leading the team back into contention.
He aims to keep showing that when the Spurs return, especially after the club helped him source extra gym equipment for his house so he can continue workouts.
"With people not being able to play basketball during this break, it will be tough but we are in the NBA for a reason and have developed a lot of muscle memory," Mills said. "So although it might be ugly for a bit but it won't take us long to hit our stride and get back to it."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sydney Kings star Xavier Cooks opts out of NBL contract</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Boomers prospect Xavier Cooks has opted out of his NBL contract with Sydney and will look to secure a better financial deal overseas.
The 24-year-old hasn't slammed the door on returning to the Kings, but he will look for a bigger contract elsewhere in the wake of the league drastically cutting player salaries.
It follows NBL MVP Bryce Cotton's exit from Perth this week due to the league's financial difficulties caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Cooks had one season remaining on his Kings contract after signing with Sydney last November.
"I would love to return to the NBL and win a championship for Sydney to finish what we started this year," Cooks said.
"Unfortunately, due to the changes in the league, my family and I feel like it's best for me to opt out of my current contract and explore my options.
"My agent will continue to communicate with the Kings throughout the off-season in the hope that a new deal can be reached."
Cooks made his move two days before the May 4 deadline for players to opt out of contracts so they could look at opportunities outside of Australia.
Cooks, who previously played in France with SG Strasbourg, was a key cog in the Kings' run towards their first grand final appearance since 2008.
Kings coach Will Weaver said Cooks went above and beyond to recover from a knee injury suffered with the national team before last year's World Cup.
"I'm grateful to Xavier for trusting us to play a role in his development as he strives to achieve his dreams of playing at the highest level," Weaver said.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Premier League clubs on Friday reconfirmed their commitment to finish the 2019/20 season subject to coronavirus restrictions being lifted in Britain despite fears expressed by players. The English top flight faces an eye-watering estimated loss of around £1 billion ($1.25 billion) if no more football is played due to the global pandemic. Playing the 92 remaining games behind closed doors would mitigate that loss, avoiding the need to repay hundreds of millions to broadcasters. But the Premier League faces huge logistical difficulties in its attempts to return to action, with Britain one of the countries worst-hit by COVID-19 as the number of deaths passed 27,500. The league and clubs discussed possible steps towards resuming the season at a meeting on Friday. "The league and clubs are considering the first tentative moves forward and will only return to training and playing with government guidance, under expert medical advice and after consultation with players and managers," the Premier League said in a statement. "The clubs reconfirmed their commitment to finishing the 2019/20 season, maintaining integrity of the competition and welcomed the government's support." The league reportedly informed clubs that matches will have to be played at up to 10 neutral venues for the season to be completed. Brighton chief executive Paul Barber said on Thursday that the idea of not playing matches home and away was a "further imperfection" on top of games being behind closed doors. - Legal challenges - The British government is due to review a nationwide lockdown on May 7 and Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised on Thursday to provide a "roadmap" towards easing restrictions. Liverpool are on the brink of their first league title for 30 years with a 25-point lead at the top of the table. However, the Premier League is keen to avoid potential legal challenges over the awarding of much more tightly contested European places, relegation and promotion if the season cannot be completed. Paris Saint-Germain were declared Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced sport could not resume before September. The decision to end the season based on average points per game has angered some clubs, most notably Lyon, who have threatened legal action after missing out on a European place. Key to any restarting of matches in the Premier League is government support. Oliver Dowden, the Secretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, struck a positive tone after a meeting with leaders of a number of sports on Friday. "We just kicked off first of many detailed meetings to plan for a safe return of elite sport behind closed doors when, and only when, it is safe to do so on the basis of expert medical advice," Dowden tweeted. However, players are questioning whether they are being rushed back into action to save the clubs money. "Obviously, the majority of players are scared but above all because they have children, babies and family, they might live with their parents," Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero told Spanish show El Chiringuito TV. "If we return I am sure everyone will be tense because the minute one person starts to feel ill, it will be 'what's going on there?'" Players would potentially face weeks away from their families, quarantined in hotels. "I am hoping that it doesn't come to that scenario," said Brighton striker Glenn Murray. "That is far-fetched, to spend eight weeks away from your family is quite a big ask." A large supply of privately sourced tests would be needed for players, coaches and backroom staff. Testing has been a thorny political issue during the pandemic in Britain, with many frontline workers unable to access tests until recently. "If football was to resume then testing will be key and an extra layer of training will be required," former Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro told the BBC. "It only takes one case for all of this to blow up."

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Cristiano Ronaldo has established himself as one of the game's great scorers, but a former Manchester United teammate believes the superstar is planning to break Pele's goal-scoring record.
Read: 'Cristiano Has Three To Four Tricks, Ronaldo Nazario Was Unstoppable'
After making a name for himself at the Red Devils, the Portuguese forward went on to superstar status during his time with Spanish giants Real Madrid where he won four Ballon d'Or titles.
Ronaldo is all the time top scorer for Portugal and Los Blancos, while he currently sits on 725 careers goals for club and country.
However, former United star Gary Neville says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner has his sights set on Pele's record of 1000 goals.
"His drive to become the best in the world was out of this world," he told Sky Sports.
Click through the gallery to see where Ronaldo has scored all his career goals.
"He was one of the few players that I've played with that would publicly announce that individual trophies were important to him.
"He just wanted to be the very best and what he's done over the years has been absolutely exceptional. His achievements have been amazing and he's worked hard for it.
"It's an obsession with scoring goals and applying himself every day, being the fittest he can possibly be. I think he's lifted his professionalism every single year and progressed.
"I think he has a plan to go on and take over Pele's record. He wants to be the greatest of all time and that is his sole purpose.
"Understanding that along the way if he is the greatest of all time, the teams that he plays for will win trophies and be successful."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Gary Neville names the one record Cristiano Ronaldo is desperate to break</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Gary Neville believes Cristiano Ronaldo’s main aim is to overtake Pele’s goalscoring record.
The 35-year-old has scored 626 goals in 838 appearances combined for Sporting, Manchester United, Real Madrid and Juventus.
Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the best players of all time having won five Champions League trophies, as well as multiple league titles in England and Spain, plus Serie A with Juventus last year.
But Neville, who played alongside Ronaldo for six years at Old Trafford, says his former United teammate has set his sights on surpassing Pele.
The Brazil legend scored 650 goals in 694 league matches during his career, while his record including unofficial friendlies stands at 1281 goals in 1363 appearances.
And Neville says Ronaldo is targeting Pele’s 650-goal tally before he retires.
‘It’s an obsession, an absolute obsession with scoring goals, applying yourself every day, being the fittest he can possibly be, I think he’s lifted his professionalism every single year and progressed,’ Neville told Sky Sports.
‘I’ve got no doubts he wants to play, and Jamie [Carragher] mentioned James Milner wants to play into his late 30s – 40, I think he has a plan to take over Pele’s record. I genuinely believe he wants to beat Pele’s numbers, that’s where I think he’s at in his mind.
‘He wants to be the greatest of all time and that is his sole purpose, understanding along the way if he is the greatest of all time the teams he plays in will win trophies and be successful.’

    <h5 class="mb-1">"Joao Felix is better suited to Barca, Real or City than Atletico"</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The ex-Benfica and PSG player Valdo said that Joao Felix would be better suited to a type of football different to that of Atletico Madrid.
Joao Felix arrived in Madrid in 2019 as Atletico Madrid's star signing and he became one of the names of the summer because the huge amount of money 'Los Colchoneros' spent on him. 
After half a season, the Portuguese has not been able to exploit his potential even though it's true that an injury cut his great progression at the beginning of the season.
The footballer was analysed by Valdo, an ex-Benfica man who also played for PSG in the 1990s: "As an ex-Benfica player, 'I'm a big fan of Joao Felix. He's a very intelligent and technical player, who is also quick at executing his actions. He has everything and many things are expected of him in the future."

The ex-player that said, believes that Atletico Madrid are not the right team for him: "In my opinion, they aren't the best team for him. I see him more at Barca, Real Madrid or Manchester City, but I hope I can fulfil those objectives."
Valdo compared him to Cristiano Ronaldo, who he did not hesitate in praising. "CR7 is the absolute professional. He is different to the rest, he gives 100%, he also trains with passion. And that is all even without talking about his talent."
"I think Joao Felix is not very similar to Cristiano Ronaldo. They are different. CR7 is CR7. Joao Felix can leave his own mark by doing his own thing," Valdo concluded.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Corona crunch: With October 31 a loose deadline, AFL grand final venue remains uncertain</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The AFL could find themselves in a race against time to guarantee the 2020 grand final is played at the MCG after declaring on Saturday they aim to complete the season by the end of October.
The MCG - which has the contract to host the grand final until 2057 - is certain to be available for the AFL until October 10 before the venue begins preparations for the ICC T20 World Cup.
The first ICC World Cup match at the MCG is scheduled for October 25 with the final to be played on November 12. There are six T20 matches scheduled at the MCG for the tournament.
Sources suggested that although the ICC is still bullish about the T20 World Cup taking place, there was still some potential for negotiation between government and sporting bodies around where a grand final might be played if the AFL season went late into October.
AFL boss Gill McLachlan said the league had set a target to finish the season by 31 October - a date that coincides with the annual contract cycle for the AFL and clubs - but nothing was locked in and the situation remained fluid.
"We think we have the flexibility with venues to go longer," McLachlan told Fox Footy.
The league owns Marvel Stadium, allowing them flexibility in determining venues for matches outside the traditional football season.
The AFL is yet to even determine a fixture for the remaining 144 games in 2020 and there remains uncertainty about when the season might start but the decisions by national cabinet on Friday have given them cautious optimism they could return to play by June.
There are 20 weeks between June 20 and October 31 but the AFL is still working on the basis the time between each club's match will be condensed thus enabling the season to be completed in a shorter time period than normal.
Other states are jockeying for position if the MCG was not available or if Victorian venues were not able to host crowds by the time finals arrived and other states could.
The Northern Territory government has already made a pitch to host AFL games in front of crowds while West Coast CEO Trevor Nisbett told ABC Grandstand he thought the AFL would look at playing the grand final in Perth if crowds could watch football at Optus Stadium.
"I would never rule it, out. This has been such an unusual year," Nisbett said.
"If we have a really clean bill of health for a long period of time well anything is possible.
"I wouldn't see why the AFL wouldn't look at it albeit they have got contractual arrangements and so forth in Melbourne I wouldn't rule out anything yet."
Perth Stadium is scheduled to host ICC T20 World Cup matches from October 24-October 30.
The AFL grand final has been played at the MCG every season since 1991.

    <h5 class="mb-1">In the last IPL, I was bowling reverse carrom: Ashwin</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW DELHI: Indian offspinner Ravichandran Ashwin talks about his future, his accuracy as a bowler, what makes him click in short-format cricket, future of spinners and how they can stay relevant in the ever evolving game of cricket in the latest episode of ESPNcricinfo Videocast.
"I am good at T20 cricket. If my body holds up, I see a purple patch coming up for me in Test cricket," said Ravichandran Ashwin when Sanjay Manjarekar asked him about his future plans.
Ashwin does not favour four-day cricket. He said, "I am a spinner and you're taking the fifth day out of the game, you're taking out a very fascinating aspect of the game."
Ashwin shared the secret of his ability to produce variations in finger spin with so much accuracy and the influence that the coaching technique of WV Raman -- former India cricketer and current coach of the Indian women's team -- had on him.

"WV Raman, who is known to be a straight forward and extremely disciplined man, trained us to throw the ball accurately that should land above the stumps. He also maintained that I stand no chance as a spinner if I cannot hit the top of the bat of a batsman every time I bowled."
The offspinner further added, "In fact, WV Raman helped me master my rhythm. He was the first person who, with or without his knowledge, inculcated this self-conscious training inside me. He would keep telling me, 'You're running 10% slower' or 'you're running 15% faster'. And this put me in a great place when I started playing first-class cricket. These are the things that I will never forget in my career. But because he was straight forward, a bit dismissive and he could put pressure on people, they started moving away from him."
Ashwin has one of the best record of bowling with a new ball.
"I like a new ball because of the fizz that I get on it. One of my strengths is to be able to put revs on the hard ball as it responds better to the pitch. But I generally like to use the arm ball in the first two or three overs because when you use the arm ball, it challenges both the edges of the batsman and forces him to go across the line, which is rendered risky.
"The others that I use are the floaters that swing, the one that pitches in and goes out or the other one that lands on the seam and gets to go the other way. So these balls become very effective.
"With a new ball, I use my middle finger more than the index finger; but when I bowl with an older ball, I try and get over the top. Sometimes, I don't use the index finger to go over the top, it is behind and I still put the revs and that's when the ball actually goes the other way," he adds.
Commenting on future of finger-spin and the success of Afghanistan all-rounder and off-break bowler Mohammad Nabi, Ashwin says, "I am really surprised that in the last IPL people (batsmen) could not pick up what I was bowling. They thought I was bowling the carrom ball but actually I was bowling reverse carrom because when I would bowl that, I would get a lot out of the pitch. Sometimes it can spin, sometimes I could get it to skid.
"In a T20 cricket, you need to call yourself a bowler. At times you should be able to bowl a bouncer or a spinner. Wrist-spin is successful not because it is challenging both edges of the bat but because of its unpredictable nature when bowling length. And this makes wrist-spin extremely relevant.
"Now imagine if someone can dish out unpredictable stuff in a very aware manner. That's the journey I have taken, and that's why I found myself amongst the wickets and in extreme control last year when I was bowling in Mohali, which can be very challenging.
"In any white-ball cricket, you can only hunt wickets down unless people are not picking it, but that is at a very novel stage of your career. Post that, you should be able to dish out things at will that can surprise the batsman.
"Mohammad Nabi is a great spinner in T20 format. He is able to change his line and length at will and that's because he has done these repetitions in the longest format. If you wake Nabi up at 3 am in the night, he'll be able to bowl at the sticker of the bat, he will then be able to change his line to wider, to closer or yorker."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Always wanted to be like Shane Warne, reveals Kuldeep Yadav</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The story of Kuldeep Yadav is one to savour - hard work, perseverance and dedication, all mixed into one. While he was a prodigal talent during his youth days in Kanpur, his talent was never given the credit until he made the ranks above on the Indian domestic circuit. 
Since then, his career has seen a massive uplift, with him even meeting his idol growing up, Shane Warne. During the meeting with Warne, the left-arm unorthodox bowler learnt a lot, including bowling in tough conditions. The 25-year-old recalled an incident in Australia when Warne explained to him how he could improve his bowling 
"I always wanted to be like him. When we were in Australia, he would come every morning and would give a few minutes to me. Whenever I would ask him like my arm comes down sooner or I'm landing fast, he would come up and explain and say give it more power, hold it tighter and try. So there were such things that he helped me with," he said on Cricbuzz's Spicy Pitch.
The 25-year-old from Kanpur revealed how he constantly underestimated himself during his early days when he was still playing age cricket. Yadav remembers numerous times when he always felt that he was not ready to represent the country, which halted his progress. Now, however, he feels that he should have donned the Indian colours much earlier than he eventually did.
"After I played the Under 19 World Cup, I was very happy that I would play the Ranji Trophy from UP. So, all through my life, I have underestimated myself. Too much! Sometimes I felt, I was not ready, even for India. But now, I feel I should've played for India much earlier," confesses Kuldeep.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ashwin Credits Former India Cricketer For Shaping His Rhythm, Gives Thumbs Down to Four-Day Tests</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India’s premier off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin foresees another ‘purple patch’ for him in Test format, provided his body holds the demands of international cricket. For all his variations, different actions, and accuracy as a bowler – Ashwin is arguably one of the most successful and skillful bowlers in the traditional format. With 350+ wickets in 71 Test matches, Ashwin is the joint-fastest along with legendary Sri Lankan Muttiah Muralitharan to pick 350 Test wickets. His accuracy and precision with the ball is what separates him from his contemporaries. Also Read - Surrey Cancels Contracts of Shadab Khan, D'Arcy Short Amid Coronavirus Outbreak
In the latest episode of ESPNcricinfo Videocast that airs on Saturday, the 33-year-old discussed about his future, his accuracy as a bowler, what makes him click in short-format cricket, future of spinners and how they can stay relevant in the ever-evolving game of cricket. He revealed that accuracy has been a part of his game for a long time and credited former India cricketer WV Raman for the same.

Ashwin said WV Raman’s discipline had a great influence early on in his career. “W.V. Raman who is known to be a straight forward and extremely disciplined man trained us to throw the ball accurately that should land above the stumps. He also maintained that I stand no chance as a spinner if I cannot hit the top of the bat of a batsman every time I bowled,” Ashwin told Sanjay Manjrekar in Videocast.

Ashwin said that Raman, who is currently working as the head coach of India Women’s cricket team, had a great role in shaping his rhythm as an off-spinner. “In fact, W.V. Raman helped me master my rhythm. He was the first person who with or without his knowledge, inculcated this self-conscious training inside me.
“He would keep telling me, you’re running 10% slower or you’re running 15% faster. And this put me in a great place when I started playing first-class cricket. And these are the things that I will never forget in my career. But because he was straight forward, a bit dismissive and he could put pressure on people, they started moving away from him.”
The Chennai-born spinner calls himself a ‘hardened’ T20 cricketer but it is the five-day format in which he has tasted maximum success. And he is far from being done in the game’s long-form.
“If my body is in great space, I think Test cricket I just have another streak of a great purple patch I am looking at.”
“I believe I am a hardened professional in T20 cricket, and good at what I do. Wherever I play I will be able to deliver, with the experience that I have got and the courage that I have,” Ashwin spoke about his future plans.
He said the ICC’s plans to trim Test cricket by a day don’t excite him. “The thought of four-day cricket doesn’t really excite me. I am a spinner and if you take a day out, I don’t know if it’s going to be healthy, you are taking out a very fascinating aspect of the game,” Ashwin said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Judge Dismisses U.S. Women's Soccer Team's Pay Discrimination Claim</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A U.S. District Judge scored a devastating blow against the women's soccer team on Friday by dismissing part of their pay discrimination claim. After rejecting an offer to receive the same pay-to-play structure as their male counterparts, the U.S. women's national soccer team filed a lawsuit claiming pay discrimination. The team sought $66 million under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, according to CBS Sports. 
"The WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players," U.S. District Judge R Gary Klausner wrote in his decision. "Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA (collective bargaining agreement) worse than the MNT (men's national team) CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT's pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure."
Additionally, the judge cited evidence presented by the U.S. Soccer Federation showing the women's soccer team "was paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the [men's team]."
Following the decision, perennial victim Megan Rapinoe vowed to "never stop fighting for EQUALITY." Rapinoe conducted a 44-minute interview with presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Thursday, failing to ask a single question about the allegation against the former Delaware senator who stands accused of sexually assaulting Senate staffer Tara Reade in 1993.
Other claims made by the team, that they were the victims of discrimination by the U.S. Soccer Federation because of the money spent on the team's commercial airfare, hotel accommodations, and other expenses, were allowed to move forward. But the heart of the team's lawsuit has been dismissed. The Associated Press reports the trial is scheduled for June 16.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US Women’s equal pay claim thrown out of court</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">United States Women’s co-captain Megan Rapinoe has vowed she will never give up the fight for equality after a federal judge threw out their claim for equal pay with their male counterparts.
The 34-year-old, who won the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball at the 2019 Women’s World Cup, has been a leading voice in the fight against US Soccer, which suffered a big blow on Friday.
Judge Gary Klausner ruled the pay case did not warrant a trial, though the players’ case for unfair treatment in travel, housing and medical support will go to trial in June.
Rapinoe, a two-time World Cup winner, tweeted: “We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY.”
The United States National Women’s Team’s (USNWT) spokesperson Molly Levinson said the team were “shocked” and that they would appeal against the decision.
“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,” she said on Twitter.
“We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.
“We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them.
“We will appeal and press on. Words cannot express our gratitude to all who support us.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The United States women’s football team’s bid for equal pay has been dismissed by a court, with the judge rejecting the players’ claims they were underpaid compared to the men.
The lawsuit was filed by 28 women’s national team players last year against the US Soccer Federation (USSF).
They had been seeking $66m (£52.8m) in damages under the Equal Pay Act.
Molly Levinson, the players’ spokeswoman, said that they planned to appeal against the decision.
“We are shocked and disappointed,” said Levinson. “We will not give up our hard work for equal pay.
“We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.”
Federal judge Gary Klausner allowed the players’ case for unfair treatment in travel, housing and medical support to go to trial, which is set for 16 June in Los Angeles.
Giving its ruling, the court said: “The women’s team has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the men’s team over the class period.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Women lose equal pay bid</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A federal judge threw out the unequal pay claim by players on the U.S. women's national soccer team in a surprising loss for the defending World Cup champions but allowed their allegation of discriminatory working conditions to go to trial.
Players led by Alex Morgan sued in March 2019, claiming they have not been paid equally under their collective bargaining agreement to what the men’s national team receives under its labour deal. They asked for more than $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In a 32-page decision Friday, U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner granted in part a motion for partial summary judgment by the U.S. Soccer Federation. He threw out the Equal Pay Act allegations but left intact the Civil Rights Act claims.
“The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,” Klausner wrote.
“Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT’s pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure,” he said.
Klausner left intact claims the USSF discriminated in its use of charter aircraft, and in the money it spent on commercial airfare, hotel accommodations, and medical and training support services.
A trial is scheduled for June 16 in federal court in Los Angeles.
“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay," Molly Levinson, spokeswoman for the women's players, said in a statement. “We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.”
Players intend to ask the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn Klausner's decision, a move that could delay the trial into 2021 or later.
“If you know this team at all you know we have a lot of fight left in us. We knew this wasn’t going to be easy, change never is,” defender Becky Sauerbrunn wrote on Twitter.
While the Americans are the most successful women's team, with four World Cup titles including the last two, the U.S. men did not even qualify for the 2018 World Cup. The USSF argued the women actually made more than the men both overall and by game average, and the women claimed they should have the same bonus structure as the men.
“Merely comparing what WNT players received under their own CBA with what they would have received under the MNT CBA discounts the value that the team placed on guaranteed benefits they receive under their agreement, which they opted for at the expense of higher performance-based bonuses,” Klausner wrote.
“This issue is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial,” he added.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Judge rules against US women's soccer team in equal pay case</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES: A federal judge dismissed the United States women's soccer team's bid for equal pay on Friday (May 1), rejecting claims the players had been underpaid in a crushing defeat for the reigning world champions.
In a 32-page ruling, Judge Gary Klausner of the US District Court for Central California in Los Angeles tossed the women's claim of pay discrimination, ruling in favour of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF).
Klausner did allow the women's case for unfair treatment in areas such as travel, housing and medical support to proceed to trial, set for June 16 in Los Angeles.
But the judge said the equal pay claims - the central plank of the case - had been dismissed because there was evidence the women had previously turned down an offer in the Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiations to be paid along the lines of the US men's team.
"The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players," Klausner wrote.
"Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA (collective bargaining agreement) worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT's pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure," he said.
"SHOCKED AND DISAPPOINTED"
The US women were left stunned by their defeat on the pay issue. The women had been seeking back pay of US$66 million under the Equal Pay Act.
Prominent US women's team star Megan Rapinoe said after learning of the court's decision that the battle is not over.
"We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY," she wrote on Twitter.
A spokeswoman for the players reacted with dismay following Friday's ruling.
"We are shocked and disappointed with today's decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay," spokeswoman Molly Levinson said.
"We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.
"We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them."
USSF said Friday night it would continue to work with the women's program to grow the game in the United States.
"We look forward to working with the Women's National Team to chart a positive path forward and to grow the game both here at home and around the world," it said.
"We are committed to continuing that work to ensure our Women's National Team remains the best in the world."
The increasingly acrimonious lawsuit had taken a dramatic turn in March, when a filing by lawyers for the federation argued that US men's team players required a "higher level of skill based on speed and strength" than the women.
The filing triggered outrage amongst the women's players while influential sponsors such as Coca-Cola voiced disgust at the remarks.
USSF President Carlos Cordeiro later resigned following the uproar, with Rapinoe accusing the USSF of "blatant sexism" in its legal filings.
The US women, who clinched back-to-back World Cup wins with victory at last year's finals in France, had based their claim for back pay in the disparities between prize money distributed by FIFA at the men's and women's World Cups.
Germany's men won US$35 million for their victory in the 2014 World Cup while France earned US$38 million after triumphing in Russia in 2018.
The United States women, victors in the 2015 and 2019 World Cups, earned total prize money of US$6 million over the two tournaments.
The USSF argued in court that between the years 2015-2019, the women actually were paid more money than the men on both a cumulative and an average per game basis.
During that period the women's national team received US$24 million and an average of US$220,747 per game while the men's team received payments of US$18 million and US$212,639 per game.
Under the current CBA, which was signed in 2017, more than half the women's team players receive an annual base salary of US$167,000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football: US Women's team vow to keep fighting after equal pay claim dismissed by court</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US women's football team has vowed to continue the fight for equal pay after their lawsuit was thrown out of court.
Last year, 28 players filed a suit against the US Soccer Federation (USSF), claiming they were being underpaid in comparison to the less successful male side.

US District Judge Gary Klausner ruled the pay case did not warrant a trial, though the players' case for unfair treatment in travel, housing and medical support will go to trial in June.
They had been seeking US$66 million (NZ$108m) in damages under the Equal Pay Act.
In response, US women's co-captain Megan Rapino tweeted: "We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY."
Fellow co-captain Alex Morgan echoed Rapino's comments.
"Although disappointing to hear this news, this will not discourage us in our fight for equality," she tweeted. 
The team's spokesperson Molly Levinson said the team were "shocked" and that they would appeal against the decision.
"We are shocked and disappointed," said Levinson. "We will not give up our hard work for equal pay.
"We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender."
Former Vice President Joe Biden has also weighed in, pledging to cut funding to the US Soccer Federation if women don't get equal pay to their male counterparts.
The Democratic nominee for US President in this year's election  told the team to not "give up this fight", adding: "This is not over yet.
"To US Soccer: equal pay, now. Or else when I'm President, you can go elsewhere for World Cup funding."
The US team won the Women's World Cup last tear in France for their fourth title overall. They have also won five Olympic gold medals.
Meanwhile, the US men's team, who failed to qualify for the last World Cup, haven't gone past the quarter-finals since 1930.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Earlier this week, a federal judge ruled against the United States women’s national soccer team and its demands for equal pay.
The California judge ruled in favor of the United States Soccer Federation on most of the key points in the ongoing wage discrimination lawsuit. Led by Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan, the players alleged the federation discriminated against them under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In the end, the judge ruled that the players “have not demonstrated a triable issue that WNT players are paid less than MNT players.” According to ESPN, USWNT players actually earned more in total and on a per-game basis than their male counterparts.
After the ruling, players like Rapinoe and Morgan made their displeasure with the ruling known.
“Although disappointing to hear this news, this will not discourage us in our fight for equality,” she said.
USWNT spokesperson Molly Levinson released a statement about the ruling.
“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay. We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.”
The fight for equal pay rolls on for the USWNT.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Court denies equal pay for US women’s soccer team</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US women’s soccer team’s claims for equal pay were dismissed by a court on Friday, handing a victory to the United States Soccer Federation.
Judge R Gary Klausner of the United States District Court for the Central District of California ruled in favour of US Soccer, dismissing players’ claims that they were underpaid in comparison to the men’s national team.
“The WNT (Women’s National Team) has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the MNT (Men’s National Team) over the class period,” the court said in its summary judgement.
The judge, however, also ruled that players’ claims they do not receive equal treatment as the men when it comes to travel, training, housing and other areas could proceed.
The trial date is set for June 16.
Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the players, said that they plan to appeal the decision.

US Soccer released a statement saying it wanted to work with the team to “chart a positive path forward to grow the game both here at home and around the world”.
“US Soccer has long been the world leader for the women’s game on and off the field and we are committed to continuing that work,” the federation said.
Team co-captain Megan Rapinoe tweeted: “We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Federal Judge Tosses Women’s Soccer Claim of Unequal Pay</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A federal judge threw out the unequal pay claim by players on the U.S. women’s national soccer team in a surprising loss for the defending World Cup champions but allowed their allegation of discriminatory working conditions to go to trial.
Players led by Alex Morgan sued in March 2019, claiming they have not been paid equally under their collective bargaining agreement to what the men’s national team receives under its labor deal. They asked for more than $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In a 32-page decision Friday, U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner granted in part a motion for partial summary judgment by the U.S. Soccer Federation. He threw out the Equal Pay Act allegations but left intact the Civil Rights Act claims.
“The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,” Klausner wrote.“Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT’s pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure,” he said.
Klausner left intact claims the USSF discriminated in the money it spent on commercial airfare, hotel accommodations, and medical and training support services.
A trial is scheduled for June 16 in federal court in Los Angeles.
“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,” Molly Levinson, spokeswoman for the women’s players, said in a statement. “We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.”
Players intend to ask the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn Klausner’s decision, a move that could delay the trial into 2021 or later.
“If you know this team at all you know we have a lot of fight left in us. We knew this wasn’t going to be easy, change never is,” defender Becky Sauerbrunn wrote on Twitter.
While the Americans are the most successful women’s team, with four World Cup titles including the last two, the U.S. men did not even qualify for the 2018 World Cup. The USSF argued the women actually made more than the men both overall and by game average, and the women claimed they should have the same bonus structure as the men.“Merely comparing what WNT players received under their own CBA with what they would have received under the MNT CBA discounts the value that the team placed on guaranteed benefits they receive under their agreement, which they opted for at the expense of higher performance-based bonuses,” Klausner wrote.
“This issue is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial,” he added.
Klausner also said the women could not go forward with their claim that the USSF discriminated against them by scheduling more games on artificial turf than the men had. He said there was not sufficient evidence to show that decisions on field surface were made for discriminatory reasons.
He rejected the USSF’s argument that the men had a competitive need for charter flights that the women lacked, allowing that part of the suit to go forward. The federation has argued that the men, who have struggled in World Cup qualifying, have more need for charters than the women in order to arrive more rested for their qualifiers.
“This rationale does not fully explain the gross disparity on money spent on airfare and hotels for the teams,” Klausner wrote.
In addition, the USSF has said spending in these areas has been equal since the women’s union agreed to a new labor deal in 2017.
Klausner allowed other claims of discriminatory travel accommodations, such as money spent on hotels and commercial flights, to go to trial along with claims on support services such as medical and training staff. He said the USSF’s lawyers waited until reply briefs to ask for those claims to be thrown out, which meant he did not have to consider them.
Seyfarth Shaw’s summary judgment motion for the USSF included arguments critical of American women’s players. That filing caused an uproar and led to the resignation of USSF president Carlos Cordeiro, who was replaced by Cindy Parlow Cone, a former national team player. Latham & Watkins took over as counsel and filed the reply brief.
Parlow Cone has said she hopes the suit can settle before a trial.
“We look forward to working with the women’s national team to chart a positive path forward to grow the game,” the USSF said in a statement. “We are committed to continuing that work to ensure our women’s national team remains the best in the world.”
Earlier Friday, the women asked that Parlow Cone be included as a trial witness. Their lawyers said although the federation backed off earlier arguments saying women were inferior to their male counterparts in skill and effort, it still planned to contest differences in responsibility.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Judge Rejects U.S Women’s Soccer Team Equal Pay Claims</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES (CN) – The U.S. Women’s soccer team’s gender discrimination lawsuit deflated Friday when a federal judge in Los Angeles granted U.S. Soccer Federation summary judgment, finding women earned more in cumulative pay and rejecting claims women would have earned more under the men’s team’s pay structure.
The ruling – issued on International Workers Day – strikes a blow to the Women’s World Cup-holders’ fight for equal pay, which appeared to have the wind at its back after a shakeup of leadership at U.S. Soccer and a string of demonstrations by fans who chanted “Equal Pay” at live games.
Fan disappointment rained down on U.S. Soccer last month after it argued playing for the women’s national team required less skill, responsibility and ability than playing for the men’s national team.
The players — including team stars Carli Lloyd, Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe — say in their lawsuit the federation has only paid lip service to stated goals of gender equity, for example by not paying women the same game bonuses men’s national team players receive.
The federation fired back in court papers, saying both national teams operate under separate and distinct collective bargaining agreements and that many women’s contracts are supplemented by their salaries in the National Women’s Soccer League.
The women ignore the full scope of their compensation, which include signing bonuses, health insurance, salaries for national team play and payments to their union for licensing rights, the federation claimed.
The federation also argued World Cup organizer FIFA – soccer’s global governing body – shares the blame for vastly smaller cash prizes for women national teams who clinch the coveted trophy.
At the 2018 World Cup in Russia, FIFA awarded $38 million to the French men’s national soccer team but awarded only $4 million a year later to the U.S. women’s team when they took home first place in the tournament.
The women’s team said in their own summary judgment motion an award of $67 million in damages would provide fair compensation for years of unequal pay.
But U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner found in favor of the federation in a 32-page order issued Friday, saying women play under the contract they collectively bargained for.
“The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,” the order states.
“Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their [collective bargaining agreement] worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT’s pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure.”
Klausner accepted the federation’s argument that the women’s team’s Equal Pay Act claims fail since they’ve not proven U.S. Soccer paid women less than men who played in a similar capacity on the national level.
During the class period, the women’s team made $24.5 million for 111 games played while the men’s team earned $18.5 million for 87 games played – meaning the women earned more per game.
The U.S women’s team said in court papers the fact they had to play important games on artificial grass, or turf, represented a form of gender discrimination.
But Klausner rejected that argument also.
“Based on the evidence submitted by plaintiffs, a reasonable trier of fact could not conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant intentionally discriminated against the WNT by subjecting them to turf surfaces more frequently than the MNT,” the order states.
Molly Levinson, a spokesperson for the USWNT, said in a statement the players were shocked by the ruling.
“We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender,” Levinson said. “We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them.”
Levinson said the players plan to appeal the ruling.
A spokesperson for the women’s union, the Women’s National Player Association, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The claims left remaining for trial – scheduled for June 16 in Los Angeles – are the women’s team’s argument the federation discriminated against them through unequal travel conditions and medical attention.
The women say U.S. Soccer spent vastly more on charter flights and expensive hotel rooms for men.
“The most common explanation provided by defendant for the charter-flight disparity is rooted in the MNT’s “competitive need.” To be sure, this is a legitimate nondiscriminatory explanation for the disparity,” the order states. “However, this explanation is “so weak” and “implausible” that a ‘reasonable fact finder could conclude that it was not an honestly held belief but rather was subterfuge for discrimination.’”
A U.S. Soccer spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The federation’s “equal skill” argument in court proceedings drew heavy criticism from current and former U.S. Women’s National Team players.
During a match in early March, the women’s national team players wore their jerseys inside out – to hide the U.S. Soccer crest – in protest.
The federation’s former president Carlos Cordeiro resigned from his post shortly after.
The women’s national team has won three World Cup tournaments, four Olympic gold medals and is currently ranked number 1 in the world by soccer’s international governing body.
Meanwhile, the men’s national team failed to qualify for the 2018 World Cup tournament in Russia and have never won the international competition.

Klausner did allow the women's case for unfair treatment in areas such as travel, housing and medical support to proceed to trial, set for June 16 in Los Angeles.

'Shock, disappointment'
The US women were left stunned by their defeat on the pay issue. The women had been seeking back pay of $66 million under the Equal Pay Act.
Prominent US women's team star Megan Rapinoe said after learning of the court's decision that the battle is not over.

Germany's men won $35 million for their victory in the 2014 World Cup while France earned $38 million after triumphing in Russia in 2018.
The United States women, victors in the 2015 and 2019 World Cups, earned total prize money of $6 million over the two tournaments.

JUSTICE | SPORTSA federal judge dismissed the United States women's soccer team's bid for equal pay on Friday, rejecting claims the players had been underpaid in a crushing defeat for the reigning world champions.In a 32-page ruling, Judge Gary Klausner of the US District Court for Central California in Los Angeles tossed the women's claim of pay discrimination, ruling in favour of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF).Klausner did allow the women's case for unfair treatment in areas such as travel, housing and medical support to proceed to trial, set for June 16 in Los Angeles.But the judge said the equal pay claims -- the central plank of the case -- had been dismissed because there was evidence the women had previously turned down an offer in the Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiations to be paid along the lines of the US men's team."The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players," Klausner wrote."Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA (collective bargaining agreement) worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT's pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure," he said.'Shocked and disappointed'
 
The US women were left stunned by their defeat on the pay issue. The women had been seeking back pay of $66 million under the Equal Pay Act.Prominent US women's team star Megan Rapinoe said after learning of the court's decision that the battle is not over."We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY," she wrote on Twitter.A spokeswoman for the players reacted with dismay following Friday's ruling."We are shocked and disappointed with today's decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay," spokeswoman Molly Levinson said."We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender."We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them."USSF said Friday night it would continue to work with the women's program to grow the game in the United States."We look forward to working with the Women's National Team to chart a positive path forward and to grow the game both here at home and around the world," it said."We are committed to continuing that work to ensure our Women's National Team remains the best in the world."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Judge rejects most of USWNT players' equal-pay suit</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The U.S. women’s soccer team players were dealt a major blow in their equal-pay lawsuit on Friday when a federal judge issued a summary judgment in favor of the defendant, the United States Soccer Federation.
Judge R. Gary Klausner of United States District Court for the Central District of California denied the players’ claim that they received lower pay than men’s national team players while performing the same work.
The judge also rejected the players’ claim that they faced unequal working conditions due to playing more games on artificial turf than their male counterparts.
Only two pieces of the lawsuit were left intact by the judge for a trial that is scheduled to commence June 16: travel conditions related to charter flights and hotel accommodations, and medical and training support services.
An appeal of Klausner’s ruling will be filed, according to Molly Levinson, the spokesperson for the women’s team players.
“We are shocked and disappointed in today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,” Levinson said in a statement. “We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.
“We have learned there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them. We will appeal and press on. Words cannot express our gratitude to all who support us.”
Several high-profile members of the USWNT weighed in on the judge’s verdict with posts on Twitter.
Defender Becky Sauerbrunn wrote, “If you know this team at all you know we have a lot of fight left in us. We knew this wasn’t going to be easy, change never is.”
Winger Megan Rapinoe, the reigning FIFA Women’s World Player of the Year, tweeted, “We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY.”
The leadup to the case gained national attention in March when court filings revealed that part of the USSF’s argument in the case was based around male players being better at soccer than female players.
The tactic was employed despite the fact that the U.S. men’s national team failed to qualify for the most recent World Cup while the U.S. women’s national team is the two-time defending Women’s World Cup champion.
The USSF wrote, “The job of a (men’s national team player) carries more responsibility within US Soccer than the job of a (women’s national team) player.
“The overall soccer-playing ability required to compete at the senior men’s national team level is materially influenced by the level of certain physical attributes … such as speed and strength, required for the job.”
The legal strategy prompted a public outcry that led to Carlos Cordeiro resigning as USSF president. He was replaced in the job by Cindy Parlow Cone, a former USWNT player.
One of Parlow Cone’s first orders of business was rejecting the federation’s stance on the value of female players and firing the law firm that took that approach on the federation’s behalf.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Judge rules against U.S. women's soccer team in equal pay case</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">LOS ANGELES, USA – A federal judge dismissed the United States women's soccer team's bid for equal pay on Friday, May 1, rejecting claims the players had been underpaid in a crushing defeat for the reigning world champions.
In a 32-page ruling, Judge Gary Klausner of the US District Court for Central California in Los Angeles tossed the women's claim of pay discrimination, ruling in favor of the United States Soccer Federation.
Klausner did allow the women's case for unfair treatment in areas such as travel, housing and medical support to proceed to trial however.
But the judge said the equal pay claims – the central plank of the case – had been dismissed because there was evidence the women had turned down an offer to be paid along the lines of the US men's team.
"The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players," Klausner wrote.
"Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA (collective bargaining agreement) worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT’s pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure," he said.
The women's claims against the USSF for discriminatory practices in use of flights, hotel accommodation and medical support can proceed.
A trial on those issues has been set for June 16 in Los Angeles.
‘Shock, disappointment'
The US women were left stunned however by their defeat on the pay issue. The women had been seeking back pay of $66 million under the Equal Pay Act.
A spokeswoman for the players reacted with dismay following Friday's ruling.
"We are shocked and disappointed with today's decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay," spokeswoman Molly Levinson said.
"We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.
"We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them."
The increasingly acrimonious lawsuit had taken a dramatic turn in March, when a filing by lawyers for the federation argued that US men's team players required a "higher level of skill based on speed and strength" than the women.
The filing triggered outrage amongst the women's players while influential sponsors such as Coca-Cola voiced disgust at the remarks.
USSF President Carlos Cordeiro later resigned following the uproar, with prominent US women's team star Megan Rapinoe accusing the USSF of "blatant sexism" in its legal filings.
The US women, who clinched back-to-back World Cup wins with victory at last year's finals in France, had based their claim for backpay in the disparities between prize money distributed by FIFA at the men's and women's World Cups.
Germany's men won $35 million for their victory in the 2014 World Cup while France earned $38 million after triumphing in Russia in 2018.
The United States women, victors in the 2015 and 2019 World Cups, earned total prize money of $6 million over the two tournaments – a difference of $66 million. – Rappler.com

"Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA (collective bargaining agreement) worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT’s pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure," he said.
The women's claims against the USSF for discriminatory practices in use of flights, hotel accommodation and medical support can proceed.
A trial on those issues has been set for June 16 in Los Angeles.
The US women were left stunned however by their defeat on the pay issue. The women had been seeking back pay of $66 million under the Equal Pay Act.
A spokeswoman for the players reacted with dismay following Friday's ruling.
"We are shocked and disappointed with today's decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay," spokeswoman Molly Levinson said.
"We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.
"We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them."
The increasingly acrimonious lawsuit had taken a dramatic turn in March, when a filing by lawyers for the federation argued that US men's team players required a "higher level of skill based on speed and strength" than the women.
The filing triggered outrage amongst the women's players while influential sponsors such as Coca-Cola voiced disgust at the remarks.
USSF President Carlos Cordeiro later resigned following the uproar, with prominent US women's team star Megan Rapinoe accusing the USSF of "blatant sexism" in its legal filings.
The US women, who clinched back-to-back World Cup wins with victory at last year's finals in France, had based their claim for backpay in the disparities between prize money distributed by FIFA at the men's and women's World Cups.
Germany's men won $35 million for their victory in the 2014 World Cup while France earned $38 million after triumphing in Russia in 2018.
The United States women, victors in the 2015 and 2019 World Cups, earned total prize money of $6 million over the two tournaments -- a difference of $66 million.

The United States women, victors in the 2015 and 2019 World Cups, earned total prize money of $6 million over the two tournaments.
The USSF argued in court that between the years 2015-2019, the women actually were paid more money than the men on both a cumulative and an average per game basis.
During that period the women’s national team received $24 million and an average of $220,747 per game while the men’s team received payments of $18 million and $212,639 per game.
Under the current CBA, which was signed in 2017, more than half the women’s team players receive an annual base salary of $167,000.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A federal judge has thrown out the United States women’s national soccer team’s demands for equal pay but is allowing their claims of discriminatory travel accommodations and medical support services to go to trial, the Associated Press reported on Friday night.
USWNT players, led by Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, alleged their collective bargaining agreement was not equal to that of the men’s team. They reportedly asked for more $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
A federal judge has ruled in favor of U.S. Soccer, though, saying the women cannot go back on the CBA they agreed on.
“The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,” U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner wrote in his decision.
“Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT’s pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure.”
Rapinoe reacted to the decision on Twitter.

“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,” Molly Levinson said. “We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.”
The players reportedly intend on appealing the decision.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A federal judge delivered a huge blow this week when he threw out the United States women’s national soccer team’s demands for equal pay. However, the judge did allow their claims of discriminatory travel accommodations and medical support services to go to trial, the Associated Press reported on Friday.
Players filed a lawsuit back in March 2019 that claimed they have not been paid equally under their collective bargaining agreement to what the men’s national team receives under its labor deal. The players were demanding more than $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Megan Rapinoe reacted on Twitter:
Alex Morgan soon followed:
A trial on claims the USSF discriminated in its use of charter aircraft, and in the money it spent on commercial airfare, hotel accommodations, and medical and training support services has been scheduled for June 16 in federal court in Los Angeles.

The USSF argued in court that between the years 2015-2019, the women actually were paid more money than the men on both a cumulative and an average per game basis.
During that period the women's national team received $24 million and an average of $220,747 per game while the men's team received payments of $18 million and $212,639 per game.
Under the current CBA, which was signed in 2017, more than half the women's team players receive an annual base salary of $167,000.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The US Women’s National Team shared a hopeful message following a federal judge dismissing the team’s lawsuit against the US Soccer Federation arguing unequal pay.
US District Judge R. Gary Klausner threw out the lawsuit on Friday but allowed their claim on discriminatory travel and medical allocations to proceed. The latter is set to go to trial in mid-June.
“The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT,” Klausner wrote in a 32-page decision, “and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players.”
Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the USWNT, later tweeted that the team was “shocked and disappointed” with the decision, adding that they “will not give up our hard work for equal pay.”
“We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender,” she wrote.
“We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them,” Levinson wrote in a follow-up tweet. “We will appeal and press on.”
The women’s players hope to overturn Klausner’s ruling to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which would, in turn, delay the trial, the Associated Press reported.
USWNT players echoed Levinson’s hopeful remarks, saying they will “continue on in the fight for equal pay.”
Team captains Megan Rapinoe and Alex Morgan took to Twitter to express their optimism in spite of the ruling.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US Soccer: Judge rules against women’s national team in equal pay case</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Kindly Share This Story:
A federal judge dismissed the United States women’s soccer team’s bid for equal pay on Friday, rejecting claims the players had been underpaid in a crushing defeat for the reigning world champions.
In a 32-page ruling, Judge Gary Klausner of the US District Court for Central California in Los Angeles tossed the women’s claim of pay discrimination, ruling in favour of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF).
Klausner did allow the women’s case for unfair treatment in areas such as travel, housing and medical support to proceed to trial, set for June 16 in Los Angeles.
But the judge said the equal pay claims — the central plank of the case — had been dismissed because there was evidence the women had previously turned down an offer in the Collective Bargaining Agreement negotiations to be paid along the lines of the US men’s team.
“The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,” Klausner wrote.
“Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA (collective bargaining agreement) worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT’s pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure,” he said.
– ‘Shocked and disappointed’ –The US women were left stunned by their defeat on the pay issue. The women had been seeking back pay of $66 million under the Equal Pay Act.
Prominent US women’s team star Megan Rapinoe said after learning of the court’s decision that the battle is not over.
“We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY,” she wrote on Twitter.
A spokeswoman for the players reacted with dismay following Friday’s ruling.
“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,” spokeswoman Molly Levinson said.
“We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.
“We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them.”
USSF said Friday night it would continue to work with the women’s program to grow the game in the United States.
“We look forward to working with the Women’s National Team to chart a positive path forward and to grow the game both here at home and around the world,” it said.
“We are committed to continuing that work to ensure our Women’s National Team remains the best in the world.”
The increasingly acrimonious lawsuit had taken a dramatic turn in March, when a filing by lawyers for the federation argued that US men’s team players required a “higher level of skill based on speed and strength” than the women.
The filing triggered outrage amongst the women’s players while influential sponsors such as Coca-Cola voiced disgust at the remarks.
USSF President Carlos Cordeiro later resigned following the uproar, with Rapinoe accusing the USSF of “blatant sexism” in its legal filings.
The US women, who clinched back-to-back World Cup wins with victory at last year’s finals in France, had based their claim for back pay in the disparities between prize money distributed by FIFA at the men’s and women’s World Cups.
Germany’s men won $35 million for their victory in the 2014 World Cup while France earned $38 million after triumphing in Russia in 2018.
The United States women, victors in the 2015 and 2019 World Cups, earned total prize money of $6 million over the two tournaments.
The USSF argued in court that between the years 2015-2019, the women actually were paid more money than the men on both a cumulative and an average per game basis.
During that period the women’s national team received $24 million and an average of $220,747 per game while the men’s team received payments of $18 million and $212,639 per game.
Under the current CBA, which was signed in 2017, more than half the women’s team players receive an annual base salary of $167,000.

    <h5 class="mb-1">US star Megan Rapinoe to continue fight for women footballers</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Dubai: US football star and captain Megan Rapinoe has promised to continue the fight after a federal judge dismissed the United States women’s team bid for equal pay late on Friday.
The US women’s team – champions of the last two Fifa World Cup editions in 2015 and 2019 – had bid for equal pay with the men’s team. Judge Gary Klausner of the US District Court for Central California in Los Angeles rejected the women’s claim of pay discrimination while ruling in favour of the United States Soccer Federation (USSF).
The judge, however, did allow the women’s case for unfair treatment in areas such as travel, housing and medical support to proceed to trial and a fresh date of June 16 has been set to handle this matter in Los Angeles.
In a 32-page judgement, Klausner said the equal pay claims - the main basis of the case tabled by the women’s team - had been dismissed because there was evidence the women had in fact earlier turned down an offer to be paid along the lines of the US men’s team.
Stunned by the judgement, the US women have responded strongly with Rapinoe pledging to chase down their legal right of seeking back pay of $66 million (Dhs 241 million) under the Equal Pay Act.
Rapinoe was the quickest to respond to the court order. “We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY,” she said on Twitter immediately.
Molly Levinson, the official spokesperson for the US women’s team, also admitted that the battle is not yet done. “We are shocked and disappointed with the decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,” she said.
“We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender. We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them,” she added.
Rapinoe plays both as a midfielder or winger for the US national team, that among other things have won the 2015 and 2019 FIFA Women’s World Cups. She won the Ballon d’Or Feminin and was also named the best Fifa Women’s player in 2019. In the past, the 34-year-old has also won gold with the US team at the 2012 London Olympics. She is co-captain of the team along with senior pros Carli Lloyd and Alex Morgan.
The increasingly acrimonious lawsuit had taken a dramatic turn in March, when the lawyers for the federation argued that US men’s team players required a “higher level of skill based on speed and strength” than the women. This had triggered outrage among the women while influential sponsors such as CocaCola had openly voiced disgust.
The USSF President Carlos Cordeiro later resigned in the aftermath of the uproar, even as Rapinoe accused the USSF of “blatant sexism” in its legal filings.
The US women earned total prize money of $6 million over their two wins in 2015 and 2019, while Germany’s men’s team won $35 million for their win in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, while France earned $38 million after their triumph at 2018 Russia.

US District Judge R. Gary Klausner in Los Angeles late Friday granted the US Soccer Federation’s request to take the women’s key pay discrimination claim out of the lawsuit that had been primed to go to a highly anticipated trial.
The dispute gained widespread attention in March when Carlos Cordeiro, who was president of US Soccer, abruptly resigned amid a furor over arguments in a federation legal filing that the women’s team is paid differently than the men’s team because its play is inferior and the competition worse, and it competes in less hostile stadiums.
The judge rejected the women’s position that they ended up getting paid more than the men only because they played more games and were more successful than the men’s team. Instead, according to the ruling, the evidence showed that the women’s team not only played more games but it also made more money on average than the men’s team.
A spokesperson for the women players said they will appeal.
“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay,” Molly Levinson said in an emailed statement. “We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.”
The fact that women received smaller bonuses than the men on the national team shouldn’t be taken by itself of evidence of pay discrimination, according to Klausner.
“This approach ignores other benefits received by women national team players, such as guaranteed annual salaries and severance pay, benefit that men national team players do not receive,” the judge said.
The judge allowed the women players to pursue their claim of allegedly inferior travel conditions, as well as medical and training support, compared to that of the men’s team.

    <h5 class="mb-1">USA Women's claims for equal pay dismissed by court</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">The USA women's national soccer team's claims for equal pay have been dismissed by a court in America.
A judge in California threw out players' claims they were underpaid in comparison with the men's national team but allowed complaints of unfair medical, travel and training to proceed to trial.
Players had been seeking $66m in damages under the Equal Pay Act, claiming they have been subject to ongoing institutionalised gender discrimination, including unequal pay, despite having the same job responsibilities as the men's national players.
"The WNT (Women's National Team) has been paid more on both a cumulative and an average per-game basis than the MNT (Men's National Team) over the class period," the court said in its summary judgement.
Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the players, said that they plan to appeal the decision.
The team's co-captain Megan Rapinoe has vowed she will never give up the fight after a federal judge threw out their claims.
The 34-year-old, who won the Golden Boot and the Golden Ball at the 2019 Women's World Cup, has been a leading voice in the fight against US Soccer.
Rapinoe, a two-time World Cup winner, tweeted: "We will never stop fighting for EQUALITY."
USA Women beat the Netherlands to claim a fourth World Cup title last summer making them the most successful side in history.
The judge, however, ruled that players' claims they do not receive equal treatment as the men when it comes to travel, training, housing and other areas could proceed.
The trial date is set for June 16.
Levinson said: "We are shocked and disappointed with today's decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay.
"We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.
"We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them.
"We will appeal and press on. Words cannot express our gratitude to all who support us."

    <h5 class="mb-1">USWNT suffers blow in equal pay lawsuit as judge rules in favor of U.S. Soccer</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A federal judge in California has granted a major ruling in favor of U.S. Soccer in the lawsuit brought bythe U.S. women's national team alleging gender discrimination.
U.S. DistrictJudge Gary Klausner has granted a summary judgment inU.S. Soccer's favor on two major items, meaning that a scheduled trial next month will no longer contain the USWNT's Equal Pay Act claim nor its Title VII claim of discrimination based on turf conditions.

With those two accusations removed, the only remaining elementof the USWNT's lawsuitthat was allowed to move forwardis a Title VII claim alleging discrimination in travel conditions (charter flights and hotel) and personnel and support (medical and training).
Klausner's ruling still has U.S. Soccer and the USWNT on course for a trial that will start June 16, but the USWNT's case has been weakened significantly by two of its strongest claims being dismissed.
In dismissing theUSWNT'sEqual Pay Act claim, Klausner said "thestatements offered by Plaintiffs (USWNT)are insufficient to establish a genuine dispute that [women's national team]players are paid at a rate less than the rate paid to [men's national team] players."
Klausner also dismissed theTitle VII claim of discrimination based on turf conditions, saying "a reasonable trier of fact could not conclude by a preponderance of the evidence that Defendant (U.S. Soccer) intentionally discriminated against the[women's national team] by subjecting them to turf surfaces more frequently than the [men's national team]."
USWNT spokeswomanMolly Levinson said in a prepared statement that the team was"shocked and disappointed" by the decision and is planning to appeal.
"We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender," Levinson said. "We have learned that there are tremendous obstacles to change; we know that it takes bravery and courage and perseverance to stand up to them.

    <h5 class="mb-1">USWNT unable to demonstrate they were illegally paid less than men, judge rules</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A federal judge issued a ruling late Friday hampering the United States women's national soccer team's lawsuit which claims the U.S. Soccer Federation violated the Equal Pay Act by paying them less than members of the men's national team.
Judge R. Gary Klausner ruled the plaintiffs were not able to demonstrate they were paid less than their male counterparts between 2015 and 2019 "due solely, or in material part, to the WNT working more than the MNT." Klasuner sided with U.S. Soccer which has said the USWNT was paid more overall during that time frame. The women said that was only because they played more games than the men, but Klausner's ruling cited as undisputed fact that the USWNT averaged more per game, as well.
Klausner said the EPA claims were ultimately rejected because of differences in the men's and women's collective bargaining agreements, noting the women rejected a pay-for-play model identical to the men in 2016, eventually offering a counterproposal with lesser bonuses (which the men rely on for their national team compensation) than the federation's offer in exchange for more contracted players and higher base salaries.
The judge also sided in part with U.S. Soccer in response to the plaintiffs' claim they were discriminated against by being subjected to playing on inferior surfaces.
Klausner's explanation didn't satisfy the plaintiffs. Molly Levinson, a spokeswoman for the women, said they were "shocked and disappointed with today's decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay." USWNT player Megan Rapinoe voiced her agreement over Twitter. Tim O'Donnell

Players intend to ask the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to overturn Klausner's decision, a move that could delay the trial into 2021 or later.
“If you know this team at all you know we have a lot of fight left in us. We knew this wasn’t going to be easy, change never is,” defender Becky Sauerbrunn wrote on Twitter.
While the Americans are the most successful women's team, with four World Cup titles including the last two, the U.S. men did not even qualify for the 2018 World Cup. The USSF argued the women actually made more than the men both overall and by game average, and the women claimed they should have the same bonus structure as the men.
“Merely comparing what WNT players received under their own CBA with what they would have received under the MNT CBA discounts the value that the team placed on guaranteed benefits they receive under their agreement, which they opted for at the expense of higher performance-based bonuses,” Klausner wrote.
“This issue is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact for trial,” he added.
Klausner also said the women could not go forward with their claim that the USSF discriminated against them by scheduling more games on artificial turf than the men had. He said there was not sufficient evidence to show that decisions on field surface were made for discriminatory reasons.
He rejected the USSF's argument that the men had a competitive need for charter flights that the women lacked, allowing that part of the suit to go forward. The federation has argued that the men, who have struggled in World Cup qualifying, have more need for charters than the women in order to arrive more rested for their qualifiers.
“This rationale does not fully explain the gross disparity on money spent on airfare and hotels for the teams,” Klausner wrote.
In addition, the USSF has said spending in these areas has been equal since the women's union agreed to a new labour deal in 2017.
Klausner allowed other claims of discriminatory travel accommodations, such as money spent on hotels and commercial flights, to go to trial along with claims on support services such as medical and training staff. He said the USSF's lawyers waited until reply briefs to ask for those claims to be thrown out, which meant he did not have to consider them.
Seyfarth Shaw's summary judgment motion for the USSF included arguments critical of American women’s players. That filing caused an uproar and led to the resignation of USSF president Carlos Cordeiro, who was replaced by Cindy Parlow Cone, a former national team player. Latham & Watkins took over as counsel and filed the reply brief.
Parlow Cone has said she hopes the suit can settle before a trial.
“We look forward to working with the women’s national team to chart a positive path forward to grow the game,” the USSF said in a statement. “We are committed to continuing that work to ensure our women’s national team remains the best in the world.”
Earlier Friday, the women asked that Parlow Cone be included as a trial witness. Their lawyers said although the federation backed off earlier arguments saying women were inferior to their male counterparts in skill and effort, it still planned to contest differences in responsibility.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Women’s soccer loses equal pay bid; other claims await trial</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A federal judge threw out the unequal pay claim by players on the U.S. women's national soccer team in a surprising loss for the defending World Cup champions but allowed their allegation of discriminatory working conditions to go to trial.
Players led by Alex Morgan sued in March 2019, claiming they have not been paid equally under their collective bargaining agreement to what the men’s national team receives under its labour deal. They asked for more than $66 million in damages under the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
In a 32-page decision Friday, U.S. District Judge R. Gary Klausner granted in part a motion for partial summary judgment by the U.S. Soccer Federation. He threw out the Equal Pay Act allegations but left intact the Civil Rights Act claims.
“The history of negotiations between the parties demonstrates that the WNT rejected an offer to be paid under the same pay-to-play structure as the MNT, and the WNT was willing to forgo higher bonuses for benefits, such as greater base compensation and the guarantee of a higher number of contracted players,” Klausner wrote.
“Accordingly, plaintiffs cannot now retroactively deem their CBA worse than the MNT CBA by reference to what they would have made had they been paid under the MNT’s pay-to-play terms structure when they themselves rejected such a structure,” he said.
Klausner left intact claims the USSF discriminated in its use of charter aircraft, and in the money it spent on commercial airfare, hotel accommodations, and medical and training support services.
A trial is scheduled for June 16 in federal court in Los Angeles.
“We are shocked and disappointed with today’s decision, but we will not give up our hard work for equal pay," Molly Levinson, spokeswoman for the women's players, said in a statement. “We are confident in our case and steadfast in our commitment to ensuring that girls and women who play this sport will not be valued as lesser just because of their gender.”

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Daniel James feels it is a "bit too much" to be compared to Wales team-mate Gareth Bale.
Winger James made an instant impact for Manchester United following his arrival from Swansea City prior to the 2019-20 season, scoring on his home debut in a 4-0 win over Chelsea.
He has since managed to add two more goals in the Premier League, as well as another for the Red Devils in the Europa League before the ongoing campaign was halted by the coronavirus pandemic.
The 22-year-old's lightning pace and willingness to run at opposing players has led some to draw similarities to Bale, yet James instead sees the Real Madrid superstar - who he describes as a "just a normal guy" - as an inspirational figure.
"I don't think you can compare me to him," James told Sky Sports.
"To play with him at Wales is obviously amazing. For anyone that doesn't know him, he's such a great guy. Just a normal guy really. He's great with the youngsters and great around the place.
"But to be compared to him is a bit too much, I think.
"What he's done in his career, how he changed from a left-back to a left midfielder, to win the Champions League... it's just amazing what he has done.
"Players like him are the ones you look up to, but I think being compared to him is a bit silly."
James has also had the chance to play alongside one of his childhood idols at club level this season, having always admired Juan Mata.
The Spaniard is not just a role model on the pitch, however, also helping the new boy settle in at Old Trafford.
"When I first met him, he came and sat next to me in the changing room and said, 'I know it's a big move for you, if you need anything here is my number and if you ever need to talk about anything I'm here.' That was obviously great for me," James revealed.
He added on Mata: "He's just someone that I've always looked up to and to play in the same team as him is just surreal for me."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Farm hand, kids detention, dead animal recycling: AFL coaches' new reality</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Six weeks ago, Garry Hocking was carefully nurturing young Collingwood footballers. Now, he's working as a farm hand on a property in Ceres, west of Geelong, where he's extracting weeds, mowing, whipper-snipping and applying chemicals to the paddocks with the hands that so expertly caressed a football.
"It's soothed my soul a little bit, you know, replaced going into a club," said "Buddha", the ex-Geelong champion, who's been stood down from his job as coach of Collingwood's VFL team."Not [replaced] the mateship and the camaraderie sort of stuff, but it's given me something to do. Otherwise I probably would've went stir crazy I think like most assistants or coaches are probably doing. You just miss that environment."
Ryan Ferguson, a development coach at Richmond, has found grisly but necessary work at CSF Proteins in Laverton, an outfit that recycles dead animals to produce feed for livestock and pets.
Having spent six years coaxing youngsters at Tigerland, Ferguson's new days begin at 7am and stretch for 10 hours, which are filled cleaning out a dank pit with a shovel, changing the pit's filter and then "reconstructing the filter".
Like most of the 170 or so coaches at AFL clubs, Ferguson needed work when he was stood down. "It's pretty dirty work but they look after us wage-wise. It's certainly worthwhile. It just takes a bit of the stress away in terms of home loans."
Chance Bateman, a West Coast assistant coach and ex-Hawthorn premiership player who also mentors the club's Indigenous players, has been fortunate to remain a coach during the shutdown; the difference is that he's coaching in a juvenile detention centre in Banksia Hills, a Perth suburb, where his background as a notable former Indigenous footballer burnishes his credibility with the inmates, a comfortable majority of whom are Aboriginal kids.
Bateman, like Hocking, Ferguson and a large proportion of AFL assistant coaches, has little idea of whether his position will be intact when the AFL returns, since the competition - without crowds for at least the bulk of 2020 - is being downsized. "It's a little bit up in the air," said Bateman, who is working with Fremantle assistant Roger Hayden at Banksia Hills, where the incarcerated teens play highly competitive games of footy (though not now).
Hocking, whose older brother Steve runs the AFL's football operations, said he did not know if the VFL would return this season, or what role he might retain, if any, at Collingwood. "You know there's still some unknowns and a lot of questions, no answers. What'll be my involvement if it goes to hubs, not hubs, or it comes back?
"I'm really uncertain, but I know that possibly there's plenty of work here [in Ceres] to be done."
These are harsh, unforgiving times for the AFL coaching fraternity. No cohort has had suffered more stand downs than (virtually all) assistant coaches, many of whom will lose their jobs. In a further injury, coaches are blamed for the blighted spectacle; there's a widespread view that a less-coached - read less defensive - game would be better.
But the clubs care for their own, and none of the 18 AFL clubs have provided more financial sustenance to stood-down assistant coaches than Bateman's Eagles, who have tapped one of the club's main sponsors, Mineral Resources, and found work for six staffers - coaches, conditioning staff and a physio - on the company's three mining sites in the Pilbara and around Kalgoorlie. BHP, also a club sponsor, is another temporary employer of West Coast staff.
Assistant coach Jaymie Graham spent a couple of weeks at Mineral Resources' Iron Valley in the Pilbara, where he wasn't required to operate machinery or extract minerals or ore. "We were there to boost morale and do some physical training [for the miners] and try to create some good habits," said Graham, who, amid yoga sessions and providing nutritional advice, did get the opportunity to detonate dynamite.
Hocking, who is working on the property of Rob Costa, brother of Geelong's ex-president and patriarch Frank Costa, relished the chance to be outdoors, though his hamstrings have been straining with all the bending. "Because I haven't been sort bending down doing ground balls or anything, bending over for large parts of the day ... The old hammies have been screaming. It's been good."
On the opposite corner of the continent, Graham found working outdoors more challenging when the temperature reached 42 degrees. "As it got cooler, it was pretty good," said the assistant coach.
As one whose playing career spanned from the late '80s to the early 2000s, Hocking is from an era when even the best players usually had jobs, and in his case, they typically weren't glamorous ones. Famously, he rolled an ankle when working for the Geelong City Council as a garbo in 1992 when he stopped running behind the garbage truck to kick the footy with a kid.
He's installed swimming pools, done paving and landscaping, sold real estate in Geelong ("tried to") and even worked as a postie, a job he had been preparing to resume when the COVID-19 crunch came. Then, with the assistance of a player he'd coached at the Geelong Falcons, he discovered Costa needed a hand on his 100-acre patch. "I was going to get back on the pushy and deliver mail. Whatever gets a few things done and pays the bills."
The coaches can be eligible for the government's JobKeeper subsidy of $1500 per fortnight, though Hocking and Ferguson weren't completely certain on that point. "I think it looks probable," said Ferguson.
Hocking, in any case, believed there was more dignity in working than sitting on his posterior. "Buddha" had found meaning in the menial.
"There were a few people possibly embarrassed," he said of those football folk who had found 'unskilled' labour. "But it's what has to be done."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Farm hand, kids detention, dead animal recycling: AFL coaches' new reality</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Six weeks ago, Garry Hocking was carefully nurturing young Collingwood footballers. Now, he's working as a farm hand on a property in Ceres, west of Geelong, where he's extracting weeds, mowing, whipper-snipping and applying chemicals to the paddocks with the hands that so expertly caressed a football.
"It's soothed my soul a little bit, you know, replaced going into a club," said "Buddha", the ex-Geelong champion, who's been stood down from his job as coach of Collingwood's VFL team."Not [replaced] the mateship and the camaraderie sort of stuff, but it's given me something to do. Otherwise I probably would've went stir crazy I think like most assistants or coaches are probably doing. You just miss that environment."
Ryan Ferguson, a development coach at Richmond, has found grisly but necessary work at CSF Proteins in Laverton, an outfit that recycles dead animals to produce feed for livestock and pets.
Having spent six years coaxing youngsters at Tigerland, Ferguson's new days begin at 7am and stretch for 10 hours, which are filled cleaning out a dank pit with a shovel, changing the pit's filter and then "reconstructing the filter".
Like most of the 170 or so coaches at AFL clubs, Ferguson needed work when he was stood down. "It's pretty dirty work but they look after us wage-wise. It's certainly worthwhile. It just takes a bit of the stress away in terms of home loans."
Chance Bateman, a West Coast assistant coach and ex-Hawthorn premiership player who also mentors the club's Indigenous players, has been fortunate to remain a coach during the shutdown; the difference is that he's coaching in a juvenile detention centre in Banksia Hills, a Perth suburb, where his background as a notable former Indigenous footballer burnishes his credibility with the inmates, a comfortable majority of whom are Aboriginal kids.
Bateman, like Hocking, Ferguson and a large proportion of AFL assistant coaches, has little idea of whether his position will be intact when the AFL returns, since the competition - without crowds for at least the bulk of 2020 - is being downsized.

    <h5 class="mb-1">R Ashwin hopes T20 leagues won’t dominate international cricket after pandemic</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">India’s premier off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin doesn’t want a post-Covid-19 world that is more conducive for organising T20 leagues at the expense of international cricket.
The fastest Indian to 350 Test wickets, the seasoned spinner said on Saturday he forsees another “purple patch” for him in the traditional format, provided his body holds. He also outrightly rejected the four-day proposal.
“I really do hope that this (pandemic) does not transpire into something where you have more leagues and not much of international cricket because the borders are closed,” Ashwin said during a videocast with former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar on ESPNcricinfo.
With the Covid-19 pandemic yet to subside, Ashwin doesn’t see cricket resuming anytime soon.
“I think we are still some distance away. In terms of the health of world cricket I think it is going to take longer than what people might assume.
“So, that’s an imminent possibility, but I don’t know what the further future has in store.”
He calls himself a “hardened” T20 cricketer but it is the five-day format in which he has tasted maximum success. And he is far from being done in the game’s long form.
“If my body is in great space, I think Test cricket I just have another streak of great purple patch I am looking at.”
“I believe I am a hardened professional in T20 cricket, and good at what I do. Wherever I play I will be able to deliver, with the experience that I have got and the courage that I have.”
He said the ICC’s plans to trim Test cricket by a day doesn’t excite him.
“The thought of four-day cricket doesn’t really excite me. I am a spinner and if you take a day out, I dont know if it’s going to be healthy, you are taking out a very fascinating aspect of the game,” Ashwin said.
Asked about Indian cricket, he said, “The current state of Indian cricket is as healthy as it can be. Hope we can pick it up from where we had left once sport resumes.”

"The thought of four-day cricket doesn't really excite me. I am a spinner and if you take a day out, I dont know if it's going to be healthy, you are taking out a very fascinating aspect of the game," Ashwin said.
Asked about Indian cricket, he said, "The current state of Indian cricket is as healthy as it can be. Hope we can pick it up from where we had left once sport resumes."
Ashwin also spoke about his love for operating with the new ball and explained the mechanics involved.
"I like a new ball because of the fizz that I get on it. One of my strengths is to be able to put revs on the hard ball as it responds better to the pitch.
"But I generally like to use the arm ball in first 2 or 3 overs because when you use the arm ball, it challenges both the edges of the batsman and forces him to go across the line which is rendered risky."
The spin ace who has often been seen with the new ball across formats, added, "The others that I use are the floaters that swing, the one that pitches in and goes out or the other one that lands on the seam and gets to go the other way. So these balls become very effective.
"With a new ball I use my middle finger more than the index finger but when I bowl with an older ball, I try and get over the top.
"Sometimes, I don't use index finger to go over the top, it is behind and I still put the revs and that's when the ball actually goes the other way."
He shared his views about the need to be versatile in the T20 format, where the bowlers have little margin for error, and about finger and wrist spinners.
"In a T20 cricket, you need to call yourself a bowler. At times you should be able to bowl a bouncer or a spinner.
"Wrist spin is successful not because it is challenging both edges of the bat but because of its unpredictable nature when bowling length. And this makes wrist spin extremely relevant."

The fastest Indian to 350 Test wickets, Ashwin said on Saturday he expects another “purple patch” for him in the traditional format, provided his body holds up.
“I really do hope that this (pandemic) does not transpire into something where you have more leagues and not much of international cricket because the borders are closed,” Ashwin said during a videocast with former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar on ESPNcricinfo.
With the pandemic yet to subside, Ashwin doesn’t see cricket resuming anytime soon.
“I think we are still some distance away. In terms of the health of world cricket I think it is going to take longer than what people might assume. So, that’s an imminent possibility, but I don’t know what the future has in store,” he said.
“If my body is in great shape, I think I am looking at another purple patch in Test cricket. I believe I am a hardened professional in T20 cricket, and good at what I do. Wherever I play I will be able to deliver, with the experience that I have got and the courage that I have.”
Ashwin said the ICC’s plans to trim Test cricket by a day doesn’t excite him. “The thought of four-day cricket doesn’t really excite me. I am a spinner and if you take a day out, I don’t know if it’s going to be healthy, you are taking out a very fascinating aspect of the game,” he said.
Asked about Indian cricket, he said, “The current state of Indian cricket is as healthy as it can be. Hope we can pick it up from where we had left.”
Ashwin also spoke about his love for operating with the new ball and explained the mechanics involved with that skill.
“I like a new ball because of the fizz that I get on it. One of my strengths is to be able to put revs on the hard ball as it responds better to the pitch. But I generally like to use the arm ball in the first two or three overs because when you use the arm ball, it challenges both the edges of the batsman and forces him to go across the line which is risky.”
The 33-year-old who has often been seen with the new ball across formats, added: “The others that I use are the floaters that swing, the one that pitches in and goes out or the other one that lands on the seam and gets to go the other way. So these balls become very effective.
“With a new ball I use my middle finger more than the index finger but when I bowl with an older ball, I try and get over the top. Sometimes, I don’t use the index finger to go over the top, it is behind and I still put the revs and that’s when the ball actually goes the other way.”
Ashwin shared his views on the need to be versatile in the T20 format, where the bowlers have little margin for error, and the importance of wrist spinners.
“In T20 cricket, you need to call yourself a bowler. At times you should be able to bowl a bouncer or a spinner. Wrist spin is successful not because it is challenging both edges of the bat but because of its unpredictable nature when bowling length. And this makes wrist spin extremely relevant,” he said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Kieran Trippier charged by FA for allegedly breaching betting rules</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England international Kieran Trippier has been charged with misconduct by the Football Association for allegedly breaching betting rules.
The charges relate to alleged betting around Trippier's £21.7m transfer from Tottenham to Atletico Madrid in July 2019.
The FA said in a statement: "Kieran Trippier has been charged with misconduct in relation to alleged breaches of The FA's Betting Rules, specifically in relation to Rule E8(1)(a)(ii) and Rule E8(1)(b), during the period of July 2019. He has until 18 May 2020 to provide a response.
"Rule E8(1)(a): a participant shall not bet, either directly or indirectly, or instruct, permit, cause or enable any person to bet on - (i) the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in or in connection with, a football match or competition; or (ii) any other matter concerning or related to football anywhere in the world, including, for example and without limitation, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters.
"Rule E8(1)(b): where a participant provides to any other person any information relating to football which the participant has obtained by virtue of his or her position within the game and which is not publicly available at that time, the participant shall be in breach of this Rule where any of that information is used by that other person for, or in relation to, betting."
Trippier has until May 18 to respond to the charges.
The 29-year-old insists he has never profited from betting on football, or from others doing so on his behalf.
"I have fully complied with the FA's investigation over the past several months on a voluntary basis and will continue to do so," Trippier said.
"I want to make it clear that while a professional footballer, I have at no stage placed any football-related bets or received any financial benefit from others betting."
Daniel Sturridge was fined £75,000 and initially given a six-week ban from football, four of which were suspended, for breaching the FA's gambling regulations last year.
A Regulatory Commission investigation found that the former England international had instructed his brother, Leon, to bet on a possible move by him to La Liga side Sevilla.
That punishment was later upgraded to a four-month worldwide ban from football and a £150,000 fine after the FA appealed because they considered the initial sanctions too lenient.
Sturridge's contract with Turkish side Trabzonspor was subsequently terminated "by mutual consent".

    <h5 class="mb-1">Former Tottenham Hotspur defender Trippier charged by FA over betting breach</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former Tottenham Hotspur defender Kieran Trippier faces an FA misconduct charge after a breach of gambling rules, English soccer’s governing body said on Friday.
An FA statement said Trippier had been charged in relation to breaches of Rule E8(1)(a)(ii) and Rule E8(1)(b).
It did not clarify what the breach entailed but that it had occurred in July 2019, around the time Trippier joined Atletico Madrid for a reported 20 million pounds ($25 million).
Tripper, who played for Tottenham in last season’s Champions League final in Madrid, has until May 18 to provide a response.
Rule E8(1)(b) states that a participant must not provide to any person, any information relating to football which the participant has obtained by virtue of his or her position within the game and which is not publicly available at that time.
Trippier issued a statement on Twitter saying he had “fully complied” with the FA’s investigation on a voluntary basis and that he would continue to do so.
“I want to make it clear that while a professional footballer, I have at no stage placed any football-related bets or received any financial benefit from others betting.”
If found guilty Trippier could face a lengthy ban.
Former Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge is the most recent high-profile player to be punished for a breach of the FA’s gambling rules.
He was initially handed a six-week ban, four of them suspended, and fined 75,000 pounds after being found guilty of providing his brother with information on a potential move from Liverpool to Sevilla in 2018.
After the FA appealed against the decision on the grounds that it was too lenient, an independent appeal board increased the ban to four months and doubled the fine.
Sturridge’s three-year contract with Turkish club Trabzonspor was subsequently mutually terminated in March.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Football: England’s Kieran Trippier charged over alleged breach of betting rules</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">England international Kieran Trippier has been charged by the English Football Association over allegedly breaching betting rules in July 2019, the month he moved from Tottenham Hotspur to Atletico Madrid.
The 29-year-old was a star of England’s run to the World Cup semi-finals in 2018 and helped Spurs to the Champions League final last season before a reported £20 million ($25 million) move to Spain. Trippier has been given until May 18 to respond.
“Kieran Trippier has been charged with misconduct in relation to alleged breaches of the FA’s betting rules”, the FA said in a statement outlining their regulations.
The statement said: “A participant shall not bet, either directly or indirectly, or instruct, permit, cause or enable any person to bet on – (i) the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of, or occurrence in or in connection with, a football match or competition; or (ii) any other matter concerning or related to football anywhere in the world, including, for example and without limitation, the transfer of players, employment of managers, team selection or disciplinary matters.”
The defender released a statement saying he would continue to fully cooperate with the investigation.
“I have fully complied with the FA’s investigation over the past several months on a voluntary basis and will continue to do so,” he said.
“I want to make it clear that while a professional footballer, I have at no stage placed any football-related bets or received any financial benefit from others betting.”
Atletico said Trippier would be exonerated.
“The player has informed us he is calm because he has done nothing wrong,” said a club source. “It seems ridiculous to him that someone would try to link him to something like this. He will collaborate with everything to clear it up as soon as possible. He is sure that in time things will become clear.”
Trippier could face a lengthy ban if found guilty. In March, former Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge was handed a worldwide four-month ban from all football-related activity for passing on inside information on potential transfer moves in January 2018.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Tennis: Many top male players support ATP-WTA merger, says Murray</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">NEW YORK: Andy Murray has backed Roger Federer's call to merge the men's and women's tours, saying that many top male players believe it will be a positive step for tennis.
"When you have a lot of the top male players now starting to discuss and talk about it, that's definitely very promising," the Briton, who has often voiced his support for gender equality, told CNN on Friday.
"When these discussions happen it's quite important not just to see this merger through a man's eyes and to bring more women into the decision-making positions so that everyone's voice gets heard," added the twice Wimbledon champion, who used to be coached by Amelie Mauresmo.
The vision of having one unified tour, which has been debated on and off for decades, was renewed after 20-time Grand Slam winner Federer tweeted last month: "Just wondering ... am I the only one thinking that now is the time for men's and women's tennis to be united and come together as one?"
While professional tennis is suspended across the board due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the men's ATP Tour offers more prize money during the course of the year than the WTA events.
Hence it is little wonder that the topic has divided opinion, with Rafa Nadal among many who are backing the proposal while Australian Nick Kyrgios wasted little time in rejecting the idea.
Billie Jean King has campaigned for a joint tour ever since she founded the Women's Tennis Association in 1973 - but it is only now that officials within the men's side of the sport seem to be willing to explore the possibility of a merger.
"I did have a chance to talk with Roger and... he said the reason he even thought about this is because he finally had some space and time to reflect and think about the sport," King told CNN. "We have to stay together as a sport."
Two-time Olympic gold medalist Murray said some resistance was to be expected, recalling conversations he had with fellow ATP players who were upset when the bigger tournaments started offering equal prize money.
"I spoke to some of the male players... who were unhappy because the prize money was equal and I said 'Well would you rather there was no increase at all?' And they said to me 'Yeah, actually'," said Murray.
"That's some of the mentalities that you're working with in these discussions."

Two-time Olympic gold medalist Murray said some resistance was to be expected, recalling conversations he had with fellow ATP players who were upset when the bigger tournaments started offering equal prize money.
"I spoke to some of the male players... who were unhappy because the prize money was equal and I said 'Well would you rather there was no increase at all?' And they said to me 'Yeah, actually'," said Murray.
"That's some of the mentalities that you're working with in these discussions."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Andy Murray backs call to merge men’s and women’s tours</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Murray has backed Roger Federer’s call to merge the men’s and women’s tours, saying that many top male players believe it will be a positive step for tennis.
“When you have a lot of the top male players now starting to discuss and talk about it, that’s definitely very promising,” the Scot, who has often voiced his support for gender equality, told CNN on Friday.
“When these discussions happen it’s quite important not just to see this merger through a man’s eyes and to bring more women into the decision-making positions so that everyone’s voice gets heard,” added the twice Wimbledon champion, who used to be coached by Amelie Mauresmo.
The vision of having one unified tour, which has been debated on and off for decades, was renewed after 20-time Grand Slam winner Federer tweeted last month: “Just wondering ... am I the only one thinking that now is the time for men’s and women’s tennis to be united and come together as one?”
While professional tennis is suspended across the board due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the men’s ATP Tour offers more prize money during the course of the year than the WTA events.
Hence it is little wonder that the topic has divided opinion, with Rafa Nadal among many who are backing the proposal while Australian Nick Kyrgios wasted little time in rejecting the idea.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Andy Murray backs move to merge ATP and WTA Tours</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Murray has joined calls to merge the men's and women's tours, arguing that many of the game's top players think it would be a positive move for tennis.
Talk of one unified tour, while not a new phenomenon, has resurfaced with Roger Federer also posing the question on Twitter in April and ex-British No 1 Greg Rusedski has thrown his weight behind such a move.
Now three-times Grand Slam champion Murray has waded into the debate and thinks it is a conversation worth having.
"When you have a lot of the top male players now starting to discuss and talk about it, that's definitely very promising," Murray, who has often voiced his support for gender equality, told CNN.
"When these discussions happen it's quite important not just to see this merger through a man's eyes and to bring more women into the decision-making positions so that everyone's voice gets heard," added the twice Wimbledon champion, who used to be coached by Amelie Mauresmo.
While professional tennis is suspended entirely due to the coronavirus pandemic, contentiously the men's ATP Tour offers more prize money in a year than its WTA counterpart does.
But the proposals in themselves are not without controversy, dividing opinion among some of the game's biggest stars.
Rafael Nadal, for example, is also among many who are backing the proposal while Australian Nick Kyrgios wasted little time in rejecting the idea.
Billie Jean King, meanwhile, has campaigned for a joint tour ever since she founded the Women's Tennis Association in 1973, but now officials within the men's side of the sport appear to be willing to explore the possibility of a merger.
"I did have a chance to talk with Roger and he said the reason he even thought about this is because he finally had some space and time to reflect and think about the sport," King said. "We have to stay together as a sport."
Two-time Olympic gold medallist Murray admitted that some resistance was to be expected, recounting conversations he had with fellow ATP players who were upset when the bigger tournaments started offering equal prize money.
"I spoke to some of the male players... who were unhappy because the prize money was equal and I said 'well would you rather there was no increase at all?' And they said to me 'Yeah, actually,'" Murray said.
"That's some of the mentalities that you're working with in these discussions."

No Emotion has a 2.5L margin to turn around on Ethanicity when they met at this track back in early March but presents the fitter of the two here.How to play it: Direct Default to win.Odds and Evens: Split.
Siding with 4. Action Shale. Has a lot of convictions with two wins from 21 starts but that’s the story of this race. He is fit, holding his form and should get the right run,.Dangers: 5. It’s Business Time beat Action Shale home last start, albeit at big odds, but warrants respect on that alone. 2. El Nieto was slow to recover here five weeks ago. Has won three of 10 and can bounce back.How to play it: Action Shale to win.Odds and Evens: Split.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Dale ready to pull a rabbit out of his hat at Sapphire Coast</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Raven’s Rabbit, a five-year-old mare who started her career running around on dirt tracks in the United States, looks well placed at the Sapphire Coast on Sunday to knock off her maiden.
The lightly-raced chestnut had her first start for astute trainer Matthew Dale back in October last year and after showing plenty of early zip, she was collared late by handy gelding Pauper. That race has provided five subsequent maiden winners.
Raven’s Rabbit was subsequently disappointing as a heavily-supported favourite at Wagga when fading to finish at the rear having led again. We’ll forgive her that blemish.
Dale has found a very winnable task for his flier today, the opening race on the card, a 908m maiden that lacks depth. He takes two runners to the spacious country track and looks set to walk away with two winners with Rubaiya equally well placed in the Club Bega Maiden Handicap (1608m).
This Rubick filly has returned a different horse this preparation having shown very little in her first three starts but excellent runs this time back have her ready to win.
First-up she cleared out from the rest of her rivals to run a narrow second behind Boom And Zoom before finding the line well at Moruya to run third despite not getting the clearest passage. River Charge won that race and has subsequently run second to Cyborg in the Wagga Guineas prelude before running third in the Wagga Guineas behind Foxborough. In second was Shelby Sixtysix and he has comfortably won two races since.
Rubaiya is third-up out to the mile from a perfect draw, so there are no excuses for her today. She should be winning this race.
Meanwhile, sometimes there is more to a horse’s form than meets the eye and expect that to be the case with Direct Default ahead of his 1408m assignment later on Sunday. He has failed in all four previous tries at the trip but they were all in the space of seven starts much earlier in his career when he was out of sorts.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Mike Tyson Wants To Make Boxing Comeback At 53</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">American boxing legend Mike Tyson is looking at making a return to the ring.
Tyson, 53, recently shared a video of him carrying out punching drills with a trainer. The video captioned “I’m a bad boy for life” is coming a week after the two-time world champion told rapper T.I that he wanted to make a comeback to the ring.
Tyson had during an Instagram live session with T.I admitted that he had been training so as to return to the ring for a four-round exhibition bout in a bid to make some money for charity.
But George Foreman, who became the oldest heavyweight champion at 45 back in 1994, believes Tyson should stay retired.
Mike Tyson competed from 1985 to 2005. He reigned as the undisputed world heavyweight champion and holds the record as the youngest boxer to win a heavyweight title, at 20 years, four months, and 22 days old. He was the first heavyweight boxer to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC and IBF titles, and the only heavyweight to successively unify them.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Former heavyweight champion and boxing legend Mike Tyson showed off his speed during a sparring session as he gears up for a return to the ring to raise funds for those affected by homelessness and drugs.
The 53-year-old plans to take part in a few exhibition bouts that will last for three or four rounds at a charity event. Tyson put a video on his Twitter page with the headline “I’m a Bad Boy for life”. Tyson, during his glory days in professional boxing, was dubbed as the “Baddest Man on the Planet” for his no-nonsense approach in the ring.
He was widely regarded as one of the best heavyweight boxers of all-time in two-decade career that saw him touch stratospheric heights. However, controversies haunted Tyson away from the ring throughout. In the video clip, which sadly lasted only for five seconds, Tyson speed is a treat to the eyes.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Video: Joe Rogan freaks out after seeing 53-year-old Mike Tyson’s scary mitt work</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Mike Tyson was the scariest man on the planet when he dominated the boxing world so many years ago, but the former champion still possesses insane punching power even at the age of 53.
Tyson, who last competed professionally in 2005 in a loss to Irish heavyweight Kevin McBride, recently expressed his interest to return to the boxing ring to stage small exhibition bouts for charity. The idea is quite admirable, but few believed Tyson would have the physical prowess to dust himself off after a 15-year absence.
After all, “Iron Mike” has spent most of his retirement creating a presence in the marijuana industry and getting chummy with prominent mixed martial arts (MMA) figures like UFC president Dana White and superstar Conor McGregor.
But despite his absence from professional boxing, Tyson still looks like an absolute beast when his fists start to fly. The former heavyweight king recently shared the following video via Twitter and it’s quite impressive:
Even UFC color commentator Joe Rogan, an avid boxing enthusiast, was excited to see Tyson back in action:
“OH SHIT! Don’t get me excited about this,” wrote Rogan via Twitter.
While Tyson would have to last longer than five seconds if he ever decided to step inside of the ring again — whether for charity or not — this is a great sign for all of the “Iron Mike” fans out there. Despite his age and time away from the sport he once dominated, Tyson still carries incredible power and footwork.
What say you, Maniacs? Would this version of Mike Tyson do some serious damage inside of the ring?
Sound off!

    <h5 class="mb-1">Murray determined to be in 'best shape possible'</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Murray says he is doing everything in his power to ensure that he is over his hip troubles when the tennis season resumes.
While most professional tennis players haven’t played competitive matches since the start of March, former world No 1 Murray hasn’t hit a ball in anger since the Davis Cup Finals in November last year after suffering an injury setback.
Andy Murray joins chorus of calls for ATP-WTA merger, saying talks have been ‘very promising’
He was hopeful of returning to the ATP Tour at the Miami Open in late March, but tennis was placed on an enforced break and both the ATP and WTA Tours are hoping to return on July 13 at the earliest.
“I haven’t played a match for six months and I haven’t actually hit a tennis ball for the past six weeks. I’ve been at home. But I have no idea, really, and I don’t think many of the players do know how it will affect them,” Murray told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.
“I’ve tried to use this time to get myself in the best shape possible to try and get my hip stronger… I’m trying to give that more of a chance to heal, but also to get stronger as well.
“I’m physically in really good shape… I’m just trying to get myself in really good shape so when we do get the opportunity to play again, my body is ready.”

    <h5 class="mb-1">Andy Murray encouraged by ATP-WTA merger discussions</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Murray believes there is strong support among leading players on the ATP Tour for a merger with the WTA.
Roger Federer tweeted his backing for a unified tennis tour last month, amid the coronavirus-enforced halt to major sporting action.
Rafael Nadal immediately backed the Swiss star and Murray, another supporter of the idea, is encouraged by the discussion, though he insists female players must also be heard.
"When you have a lot of the top male players now starting to discuss and talk about it, that's definitely very promising," the two-time Wimbledon winner said to CNN.
"When these discussions happen it's quite important not just to see this merger through a man's eyes and to bring more women into the decision-making positions so that everyone's voice gets heard."
Murray, who was previously coached by Amelie Mauresmo, has long been an advocate for the women's game, but explained challenges remain in changing the views of some.
"I spoke to some of the male players... who were unhappy because the prize money was equal," he said.
"I said, 'Well would you rather there was no increase at all?' And they said to me, 'Yeah, actually.'
"That's some of the mentalities that you're working with in these discussions."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Many top male players support ATP-WTA merger, says Murray</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Andy Murray has backed Roger Federer's call to merge the men's and women's tours, saying that many top male players believe it will be a positive step for tennis.
NEW YORK: Andy Murray has backed Roger Federer's call to merge the men's and women's tours, saying that many top male players believe it will be a positive step for tennis.
"When you have a lot of the top male players now starting to discuss and talk about it, that's definitely very promising," the Briton, who has often voiced his support for gender equality, told CNN on Friday.
"When these discussions happen it's quite important not just to see this merger through a man's eyes and to bring more women into the decision-making positions so that everyone's voice gets heard," added the twice Wimbledon champion, who used to be coached by Amelie Mauresmo.
The vision of having one unified tour, which has been debated on and off for decades, was renewed after 20-time Grand Slam winner Federer tweeted last month: "Just wondering ... am I the only one thinking that now is the time for men's and women's tennis to be united and come together as one?"
While professional tennis is suspended across the board due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the men's ATP Tour offers more prize money during the course of the year than the WTA events.
Hence it is little wonder that the topic has divided opinion, with Rafa Nadal among many who are backing the proposal while Australian Nick Kyrgios wasted little time in rejecting the idea.
Billie Jean King has campaigned for a joint tour ever since she founded the Women's Tennis Association in 1973 - but it is only now that officials within the men's side of the sport seem to be willing to explore the possibility of a merger.
"I did have a chance to talk with Roger and... he said the reason he even thought about this is because he finally had some space and time to reflect and think about the sport," King told CNN. "We have to stay together as a sport."
Two-time Olympic gold medalist Murray said some resistance was to be expected, recalling conversations he had with fellow ATP players who were upset when the bigger tournaments started offering equal prize money.
"I spoke to some of the male players... who were unhappy because the prize money was equal and I said 'Well would you rather there was no increase at all?' And they said to me 'Yeah, actually'," said Murray.
"That's some of the mentalities that you're working with in these discussions."

    <h5 class="mb-1">Hugh's beauty lands five winners as Bowman warms up chilly Randwick</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">There was a time a few years ago when the social media scorn thought there were two Hugh Bowmans: one for carnival time and one for non-carnival time.
The theory went when your money was on while he was riding under the bright lights it was game on. Outside of that, when Winx was in the paddock or pre-training or trotting laps of Rosehill or trialling and Bowman was riding slower horses at a slow time of year, you were never quite sure what you would get.
The sentiment was highly unfair, but it managed to get oxygen from behind a keyboard.
This year, the coronavirus-crippled autumn carnival has been and gone. The weather is cooling down and the jockeys who do it tough weight wise - not many do it tougher than Bowman - feel the most heat when they get out of bed in the morning and can't feel their toes. The scales don't budge as easily.
Bowman is only a few weeks removed from riding all three legs of the two-year-old triple crown, including his first Golden Slipper. If he was flat you could hardly blame him.
Yet as the wind blew through a frozen Randwick on Saturday, there was little in the way of change.
Bowman rode a five-timer on the Kensington track for five different stables: Winx's handler Chris Waller, Team Hawkes, John O'Shea, the partnership of Peter and Paul Snowden and James Cummings' Godolphin juggernaut.
It could have been six if not for Glen Boss crashing the party on Wild About Her in the last, just edging out the Bowman-ridden Juventus. Boss turned around shortly after they passed the post and quipped: "how does it feel to run second?"
Asked about his affinity with Randwick's inner circuit, a modest Bowman joked: "I couldn't stand the joint before today. There's no magic about what I'm doing, I've just had the right horses with conditions to suit."
After one last-stride winner he mentioned the Melbourne Cup in the same breath as a benchmark 78 winner, Waller's Yonkers.
The horse was bought by bloodstock guru Guy Mulcaster out of the United States, raced initially in Europe before ending up in Australia. On face value, the horse's story seems as strange as Bowman's prediction after he took every inch of the straight to nab Gone Bye over 1800 metres.
But Bowman knows what's ahead, a spring carnival with little chance of international visitors and it's not fanciful to think Yonkers will make the cups grade should 2020 be an antipodean-only year.
"I'm not saying he’s a Melbourne Cup horse, but he’s certainly going to be up to the better staying races in the spring," Bowman shrugged.
He then sat motionless on the Hawkes' Dirty Work, who won with the same authority of Winx at her pomp. O'Shea's Rocha Clock came from last and rounded up her rivals. Betting drifter Hightail had the blinkers on and showed the same laser-like focus of his rider, stalking main danger Hilo and sprinting clear. And then a race later he arrived late to win on Phaistos, who he ironically gunned down by a nostril riding stablemate Ranier last start.
It was a riding masterclass. The only disappointment was the fact there was almost no one there to watch it in person.
Rachel King nabbed an early riding double of her own when she saluted aboard Ciaron Maher and David Eustace's Macroura in the first before John Thompson's sharp filly Fituese trounced her rivals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Rumour Has It: Sancho an alternative to Neymar for Barcelona</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Barcelona are reportedly looking at Jadon Sancho as an alternative if they cannot land Neymar.
Neymar is linked with a return to Camp Nou from Paris Saint-Germain, where he arrived from Barcelona for a world-record €222million in 2017.
But the LaLiga giants have options.
TOP STORY – SANCHO AN ALTERNATIVE TO NEYMAR FOR BARCELONA
Borussia Dortmund star Sancho is an alternative to Neymar for Barcelona, according to Sport.
The cover of the Spanish daily says Barca are thinking of Sancho if they are unable to bring Neymar back to the club.
Sancho was enjoying an incredible season with 14 goals and 15 assists in 23 Bundesliga games when the campaign was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.
ROUND-UP
- Linked with a move for RB Leipzig star Timo Werner, Liverpool may not be trying to sign the forward. The Mirror reports the Premier League leaders look almost certain not to do any transfer spending in the close season.
- Lyon forward Moussa Dembele has enjoyed another good season with the Ligue 1 club. The Manchester Evening News reports Dembele would find it hard to turn down a move to Manchester United in the next transfer window.
- Miralem Pjanic could be set for a Juventus exit. Marca reports the pieces are falling into place for the midfielder to join Barcelona. It says another player could enter the deal if Arthur does not agree to leave the LaLiga giants.
- Staying at Barcelona and Sport reports the door is open for the club to land Layvin Kurzawa on a free at season's end with Porto's Alex Telles seemingly nearing a move to Paris Saint-Germain.
- Gianluigi Donnarumma is out of contract at Milan in 2021, but La Gazzetta dello Sport reports the goalkeeper could extend his deal by a year and plan a path forward, with the coronavirus pandemic likely to impact the upcoming transfer window.
- Rayan Cherki, 16, scored three goals in 12 games for Lyon this season, seemingly leading to some interest. AS reports the teenage forward is being watched by Real Madrid.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Liverpool target Werner rules out Bayern Munich transfer, prefers move abroad</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">RB Leipzig striker Timo Werner has ruled out a switch to Bundesliga champions Bayern Munich and said he would prefer a move abroad.
Werner, 24, has a contract until 2023 and a release clause in the €50 million to €60m region which allows him to leave Leipzig this summer.

The Germany international has been linked with a move away but said Bayern is not an option for him in the future.
"Bayern are a great club, we don't need to talk about it, and Hansi Flick has proven this season he is a really good head coach," he told Bild.
"But if a move were to become an issue at some point, I would be more tempted by a move abroad than a move to Bayern.
"It's just that the challenge of another league would appeal to me a little more than a move within the Bundesliga.
"Of course, it also important that mutual respect is there as much as possible. That's why I chose RB Leipzig at the time, and why I would choose the club for [the] next step as one where I would get that feeling."
Reports have suggested that Liverpool are interested in the striker and Werner said he was proud to be linked with "the best team in the world."
However, Leipzig sporting director Markus Krosche has said the striker could stay at the club due to the uncertainties caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
Before the global outbreak halted the sport, Werner scored 27 goals in all competitions this season and helped Leipzig progress to the Champions League quarterfinals.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Sancho-Ansu Fati swap deal being considered</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Barcelona are looking for ways to improve the squad for next season. In Germany there is talk of a swap with Borussia Dortmund between Ansu Fati and Jadon Sancho.
Borussia Dortmundare resigned to losing Jadon Sancho. The Germans could ask for Ansu Fati in return to try and get at least some compensation.
According to 'Bild', the possibility of changing a player for another is on the table. And the German outfit have now apparently considered getting the Barca academy player to replace Sancho.
Barca, 'Sport' says, want Sancho if they cannot sign Neymar this summer. The Brazilian will struggle to leave PSG during a summer badly affected by the economic crisis so getting Sancho looks much more likely.
The English media are also talking about Barcelona's interest in the English striker. 'Daily Star' says that Sancho will join Man Utd.
The Red Devils apparently have an agreement with Dortmund for Sancho to depart this summer, but that could change now that Barca are offering Fati.
The German outfit have put a 130 million euro price tag on Sancho, a price which would be much less if Ansu Fati were included.
The La Liga side have not ruled out letting the youngster leave either on loan or in a sale which would include a buy back option later.
Dortmund's proposal would be badly received by Quique Setien as he does not want the forward to go anywhere.
Barca and Dortmund could be part of one of the more unusual signings in recent years in football.

    <h5 class="mb-1">On this day: Born May 3, 1942: Vera Caslavska, Czech gymnast</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">(Reuters) - When Vera Caslavska bowed her head and turned away in protest at the Soviet anthem during the 1968 Olympics, the Czech gymnast cemented her place as not only one of the country’s greatest athletes but also as a powerful voice against Communist rule.
Two months after Warsaw Pact tanks swept into Czechoslovakia to crush the “Prague Spring” reforms, the anti-Soviet icon dazzled at the Mexico Games, claiming four golds and becoming one of only two women to win successive titles in the all-around competition.
Yet it was her silent moment of defiance as the anthem played during the medal ceremony for the floor exercise, when she controversially shared a joint gold with a Soviet athlete after the judges upgraded the preliminary scores of her rival, that endeared her to Czechs.
It also made her a beloved figure long after her sporting career had ended.
“We Olympians were the only ones who could demonstrate our attitude to the Soviet occupation to the world at that time of occupation,” Caslavska said in a 2007 interview with iDNES.cz.
All together, Caslavska took seven golds in her two Olympic Games, including back-to-back wins in the vault. She also won the beam at Tokyo 1964 and the uneven bars in 1968.
Caslavska, who began her sporting career as a figure skater, was also the first and only gymnast to win an all-around title at an Olympic Games before winning it at the World Championships, European Championships and ensuing Olympics.
Her main rival in Tokyo, Ukrainian-born Larisa Latynina, was the only other female gymnast to win successive golds in the all-round competition, in 1956 and 1960.
“She was a phenomenal sportswoman,” Latynina told Reuters after Caslavska died in 2016 from pancreatic cancer. “Vera and I were friends and we would give each other presents. We would also swap vinyl records.”
Czech authorities, however, nearly stopped Caslavska’s journey to Mexico City in its tracks after she publicly opposed Soviet rule by signing a dissident manifesto in the spring of 1968.
Forced to hide in the mountains to avoid arrest, the gymnast only gained permission to compete at the last minute.
During her time in hiding, she lifted potato sacks to keep fit and substituted logs for beams to prepare for the games where her dominant performances and decision to use the Mexican Hat Dance as music for one of her routines won the adoration of the local fans.
Caslavska topped off her remarkable Olympics by marrying Czech 1,500 metres champion Josef Odlozil in Mexico City, 24 hours after her competition ended, in an event that drew thousands of well wishers.
Yet her triumph abroad did not translate into a warm welcome at home.
Caslavska was expelled from the Czech sports union and ostracised for criticising the 1968 invasion and refusing to withdraw her signature from the Prague Spring protest movement’s “Manifesto of 2000 Words.”
From 1974 she trained other gymnasts at home and also during a spell in Mexico. Czechs later voted her as the nation’s second-greatest athlete after runner Emil Zatopek.
When Communist rule ended in Czechoslovakia in 1989, President Vaclav Havel appointed her his adviser for sport and social issues. She also led the Czech Olympic Committee from 1990 to 1996.
Her personal life following the country’s “Velvet Revolution” that ended authoritarian rule in 1989 was not easy.
In 1993 her then ex-husband Odlozil died from injuries suffered in a fall after he was struck by their son Martin during a dispute.
In later years, Caslavska fell into a deep depression but overcame the illness and returned to public life, coaching gymnasts and serving as a mentor to younger Olympians.
She was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2015 and died the following summer.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Covid-19: Australia bans use of saliva as sports activities set to return</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Australia banned saliva and sweat to shine the cricket ball as the federal government released guidelines for the gradual return of professional and recreational sport in the coronavirus pandemic, cricket website ESPNCricinfo reported.
Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) made the guidelines with the help of medical experts, sporting bodies, and federal and state governments.
Cricket Australia's chief medical officer John Orchard was also involved in the preparation of the framework.
Under the AIS framework, restrictions on sport are currently outlined as being at "Level A" restricting all training except that of the individual kind.
But soon there will be a shift to "Level B" and it will allow net sessions in which batters will be able to face bowlers. However, bowlers will be limited for the session. Level B will also allow for unrestricted fielding sessions.
Under Level B, warm-up drills involving unnecessary person to person contact has not been allowed. Ball shining with sweat/saliva has also been not allowed under training, ESPNCricinfo reported.
The third and final "Level C", will be permitted later in the year and it is outlined as: "Full training and competition. No ball shining with sweat/saliva in training."Shining the ball is a major thing for bowlers in trying to extract some swing from the match. As the game starts swaying in favour of batsmen by each passing day, bowlers have to try everything they can in trying to trouble the batsmen.
Earlier this year, even India pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar was skeptical of using saliva on the ball ahead of the ODI series against South Africa.
"We are taking every precaution we can. We have a team of doctors with us, who are advising us on dos and don'ts. We have a meeting with our doctors. If they advise us to not use saliva on the ball, then we will follow it. So, it all depends upon the instructions given by the doctor," Bhuveshwar Kumar had said during a press conference earlier this year.
Right now, no sport is being played as all top tournaments like IPL, Premier League, LA Liga have been suspended and there is no certain answer as to when all these competitions will resume.
Wimbledon 2020 has been cancelled for the first time since World War II and Tokyo Olympics have been postponed for the first time.
The World Health Organisation had termed coronavirus as a 'pandemic' on March 11.

    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">After the reports of ICC contemplating legalised ball-tampering so as to discourage players to shine the ball with sweat or saliva, Australian federal government, led by Prime Minister Scott Morrison, banned shining the ball with saliva or sweat as the government prepare for the staged return of both professional and recreational sport amid the coronavirus pandemic.
ESPN Cricinfo reported that the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) have drawn up guidelines after consulting medical experts, sporting bodies and federal and state governments. Cricket Australia's chief medical officer John Orchard was involved in the preparation of the framework as well. 
Although NRL is supposed to get the first preference, it is also reported that Cricket might actually make a fast return, for essentially it is a non-contact sport. The Australian cricket team's next scheduled matches in Australia is a limited-overs series against Zimbabwe in August and if the stage clears, it might actually become the first sporting event to happen.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Cricket Australia to work with government to prepare biosecurity plan</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">MELBOURNE: In Australia, the use of saliva or sweat to shine the ball will be restricted once cricket training returns in the post coronavirus world. The federal government in Australia has released a framework regarding the staged return of sports amid the pandemic under the title "The Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) Framework for rebooting sport in a COVID-19 environment" available on the official government website.
AIS, in consultation with medical experts, sporting bodies and federal and state governments, has come up with guidelines wherein they have restricted the use of saliva and sweat to shine the ball.
The framework, which outlines a staged return to play, has three stages -- Level A, Level B and Level C. Currently, sports is outlined as being at "Level A", which restricts all training except that of the individual kind. "Running/aerobic training (solo), resistance training (solo), skills training (solo)."
However, in probably a week's time, it will move to "Level B" which will allow the following: "Nets -- batters facing bowlers. Limit bowlers per net. Fielding sessions -- unrestricted. No warm up drills involving unnecessary person-person contact. No shining cricket ball with sweat/saliva during training."

The third and final "Level C", to be permitted later in the year, is outlined as: "Full training and competition. No ball shining with sweat/saliva in training."
Meanwhile, Cricket Australia also welcomed Prime Minister Scott Morrison's announcement regarding national principles for the recommencement of community and professional sport, as agreed by the national cabinet.
"As and when restrictions are lifted, CA will seek advice from medical experts including our own Chief Medical Officer, John Orchard, and relevant government agencies to support the cricket community with protocols and guidelines that allow community cricket to recommence as early and as safely as possible," CA said in a statement.
"Cricket Australia will continue to work with government to prepare a comprehensive biosecurity plan to ensure we are as prepared as possible to deliver elite cricket content on Australian soil, including an exciting summer of cricket highlighted by the ICC T20 World Cup 2020 and the Border-Gavaskar Test series between Australia and India," it added.
In the framework, there are also guidelines for training and management of illness in elite sports.
"Individuals should not return to sport if in the last 14 days they have been unwell or had contact with a known or suspected case of COVID-19.
"Athletes returning to sport after COVID-19 infection require special consideration prior to resumption of high intensity physical activity.
"Resumption of sporting activity may not be linear. Increasing restrictions may be required in response to fluctuating numbers of COVID-19 cases."
The government has said that the AIS framework is a "timely tool" for 'how' reintroduction of sport activity will occur in a cautious and methodical manner, to optimise athlete and community safety.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Artists, athletes cling to their dreams on Havana's rooftops</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">HAVANA: These are hot, humid days in Havana. When the afternoon breeze sweeps in off the sea, William Roblejo steps onto the roof of his building, draws his bow across the strings of his violin, and runs through his repertoire of music to soothe an anxious city.
Access to a rooftop and a breeze is a coveted luxury in the Cuban capital, areas of which have been in lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic for several weeks.
On other Havana rooftops, the country's top ballet dancer rolls out a mat and runs through his positions and pirouettes, an Olympic pentathlete lunges at an imaginary rival with an epee, and a Greco-Roman wrestling champion pumps iron.

Cuba has imposed lockdowns only in certain barrios, but the government has called on people to stay home as the number of confirmed infections climbed above 1,500 this week with 64 deaths.
With temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius, water shortages in some areas of the capital and long lines at food stores, Cubans have grown more anxious under weeks of confinement.
Adrian Sanchez, first soloist at the National Ballet of Cuba, fears above all that his muscles and his posture, used to a daily nine-hour training regime, will atrophy.
"When all this is over we have to return to the ballet, and if we come back untrained, that will be very hard," said Sanchez, 22.
He practices "two or three hours" a day on the roof of his building, reached through a skylight and overlooking the iconic Revolution Square.
"That way the time goes by faster, and I don't feel I'm being locked up so long," he says.
Like everyone else, a good part of his day is spent queuing up for food.
After decades of living under a US blockade, Cubans are adept at making do, even under the most difficult of circumstances -- not least their athletes and performers who now have to find a way to pursue their dreams during the uncertainty fuelled by the pandemic.
Leydi Moya pulls out her epee to practice her fencing as part of her preparations for the next Olympic pentathlon event, whenever that may be.
Moya, youth Olympic champion in Singapore 2020 and triple-medallist at the Pan-American Games in Lima last year, was returning from a training camp in Mexico when the pandemic hit the region.
She knows that the makeshift training regimen she is reduced to at home is a far cry from Olympic-standard fitness training.
"Performance is going to drop," she admits.
It's a similar situation for Daniel Gregorich, a Pan-American champion in Greco-Roman wrestling at his 87 kg weight level, who made Cuba's Olympic team at a recent qualifying event in Ottawa, Canada.
"Sport is health, sport is life and at least it calms my anxiety," the 23-year-old said between sessions of lifting weights and doing push-ups.
Roblejo, the musician, is at times frustrated by not having his usual concert audience because "musicians are used to delivering art live."
But he is also grateful for some of the quarantine's gifts as he plays on his rooftop above the deserted barrio of Playa, where the lulling sounds of the sea are more noticeable now there is no traffic.
"I have to thank this quarantine a little bit, because I studied a bit more and I think I've advanced in my music. Now I want this to be over so that I can show it," said Rob Lejo, head of the string section of Havana's Conservatory.
In many ways, he admits to being "very happy. I've been locked up and playing alone at home for 20 or 25 days now."
Psychologist Patricia Ares, writing in Granma, the daily of the ruling Communist Party, said "all of us will have to learn to live with adversity.
"We cannot avoid the wind, but we can build windmills."

    <h5 class="mb-1">On this day 10 yrs ago: Suresh Raina became the 1st Indian to score T20 ton</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It was on May 2, 2010, when Suresh Raina became the first Indian to score a century in T20 international match. The left-handed batsman achieved the feat against South Africa in the 2010 T20 World Cup.
In the match between India and South Africa, the latter won the toss and opted to bowl first. Raina came to the crease in the very first over of the innings as India lost its first wicket in Murali Vijay.
The southpaw then went on to play a quickfire knock of 101 runs off just 60 balls. Raina's innings was studded with nine fours and five sixes. Playing second fiddle to Raina, Yuvraj Singh scored 37 off 30 balls with three fours and two sixes. The duo's 88-run stand in the middle put India in a comfortable position.

However, the Men in Blue failed to make it to the semi-finals of the tournament.
To date, Rohit Sharma has scored four T20I centuries, while KL Rahul has two to his name in the shortest format of the game.
Raina has enjoyed a great career in the shortest format of the game and he is the second-highest run-getter in the Indian Premier League. The left-handed batsman has played 193 matches for Chennai Super Kings and has managed to score 5,368 runs in the tournament so far.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Watch: Suresh Raina’s 101 against South Africa in 2010, the first ton by an Indian in T20I cricket</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">A total of three Indian batsmen have hit centuries in T20 International cricket. While Rohit Sharma has four to his name and KL Rahul has two, the first Indian to get a ton in a T20I was Suresh Raina.
The southpaw played a knock for the ages against South Africa during the 2010 World T20 in West Indies. Raina scored 101 runs off just 60 balls in that match, with nine fours and five sixes, and helped India register a 14-run win.
When in form, Raina could strike the ball as cleanly as any batsman. During that innings, he showcased his full array of strokes and used his wonderful bat-swing to devastating effect.
Raina has an impressive record in the shortest format, be it in international cricket or in the Indian Premier League. The left-hander has 1,605 runs to his name from 78 T20Is, with an average of 29.18 and a strike-rate of 134.87. He is the second-highest run-scorer in the IPL, having scored 5,368 runs from 193 matches.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Suresh Raina recalls when he became first Indian, third in world to score a T20I century</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Recalling his achievement on this day in 2010, Suresh Raina said scoring the first-ever T20I century for India was “one of the most memorable moments” in his career.
On May 2, 2010, Raina had cracked a breezy 60-ball 101 against South Africa in a World Cup match. Raina’s blistering knock, which helped India pile up an intimidating 186 for five, had nine fours and five sixes. India had won the match by 14 runs.
This had then been the first T20I ton by an Indian and the third overall. Chris Gayle and Brendon McCullum had been the two others who had scored centuries before Raina.
Taking to Twitter 10 years after the feat, Raina wrote: “One of the most memorable moments for me. Scoring a first ever T20i century for my country undoubtedly filled me with a lot of confidence, energy a never ending zest of giving my 100% to my game every time I’m on the field.”
Speaking after the match, Raina had said in 2010, “If you play 40 to 50 balls and you can score 80 to 85 runs. I had batted well in the IPL and knew that number three is a crucial position and if you bat well, sure you can get a hundred.”
Hundreds in the T20 format are rare for batsmen, with only two Indians having replicated Raina’s feat in international T20s since then. Rohit Sharma has four centuries in T20Is and KL Rahul has two.
Incidentally, Raina had also scored his first 100 in the IPL on May 2 in 2013.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Three test positive for coronavirus at Cologne</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">BERLIN
Three people have tested positive for coronavirus at Cologne and will be placed into a 14-day quarantine, the Bundesliga club said Friday in a potential blow to hopes of restarting the German football season this month.
"Cologne had the entire team and coaching staff, along with the backroom staff, tested on Thursday for COVID-19. Three people tested positive, all are symptom free," the club said in a statement on its website.
"After an assessment of the cases by the responsible health authorities, the three people who tested positive will go into a 14-day quarantine at home.
"Cologne will not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those affected."
The club said it would continue to train in preparation for the campaign to resume, with further tests to be carried out as part of the league's health and safety protocol.
"We now see in everyday life that our concept recognises and reduces risks at an early stage," said Tim Meyer, head of the German league's medical task force.
"We are convinced that with our concept, we can enable players to practice their profession with the best possible protection against infection."
The Bundesliga had set a target return date of May 9 but still needs permission from the German government.
A delay on the decision this week meant a resumption would not be possible before May 16.
A final decision is expected next Wednesday.
The German league confirmed Thursday that clubs had started testing players for the virus as part of plans to get the season up and running again.It has been suspended since March 13.
Clubs returned to training at the start of April while adhering to social distancing guidelines and games would be played behind closed doors, with large-scale public events banned in Germany until August 31.
Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke warned last weekend that "the entire Bundesliga will go down" unless the league restarts.
Germany's top clubs are desperate for the season to be completed by June 30 in order to claim an instalment of television money worth 300 million euros ($325 million).
A return in May would make the Bundesliga the first top league in Europe to resume as Germany cautiously eases lockdown measures.
Nevertheless, there is heated debate about whether the Bundesliga should resume amid the pandemic which has so far claimed the lives of more than 6,000 people in Germany.
Paris Saint-Germain were declared Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced sport could not resume in France before September.
Meanwhile, English Premier League clubs on Friday reconfirmed their commitment to finish the season subject to coronavirus restrictions being lifted.There are still 92 games remaining. They will be behind closed doors with neutral venues suggested.
Italy's 20 Serie A clubs on Friday also reiterated their unanimous desire to complete the season despite sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora this week saying the chances of restarting were "increasingly narrow".
In Spain, La Liga is planning to start testing players for the coronavirus between Tuesday and Thursday next week, after which they would then be able to resume individual training programmes within 48 hours.
"I hope that we can start playing in June. We have until June 28," league president Javier Tebas said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Bundesliga restart plans dealt a blow as three test positive for coronavirus at Cologne</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Three people have tested positive for coronavirus at Cologne and will be placed into a 14-day quarantine, the Bundesliga club said Friday in a potential blow to hopes of restarting the German football season this month.
“Cologne had the entire team and coaching staff, along with the backroom staff, tested on Thursday for COVID-19. Three people tested positive, all are symptom free,” the club said in a statement on its website.
“After an assessment of the cases by the responsible health authorities, the three people who tested positive will go into a 14-day quarantine at home.
“Cologne will not confirm any names out of respect for the privacy of those affected.”
The club said it would continue to train in preparation for the campaign to resume, with further tests to be carried out as part of the league’s health and safety protocol.
“We now see in everyday life that our concept recognises and reduces risks at an early stage,” said Tim Meyer, head of the German league’s medical task force.
“We are convinced that with our concept, we can enable players to practice their profession with the best possible protection against infection.”
The Bundesliga had set a target return date of May 9 but still needs permission from the German government.
A delay on the decision this week meant a resumption would not be possible before May 16.
A final decision is expected next Wednesday.
The German league confirmed Thursday that clubs had started testing players for the virus as part of plans to get the season up and running again.
It has been suspended since March 13.
Clubs returned to training at the start of April while adhering to social distancing guidelines and games would be played behind closed doors, with large-scale public events banned in Germany until August 31.
Borussia Dortmund chief executive Hans-Joachim Watzke warned last weekend that “the entire Bundesliga will go down” unless the league restarts.
Germany’s top clubs are desperate for the season to be completed by June 30 in order to claim an instalment of television money worth 300 million euros ($325 million).
A return in May would make the Bundesliga the first top league in Europe to resume as Germany cautiously eases lockdown measures.
Nevertheless, there is heated debate about whether the Bundesliga should resume amid the pandemic which has so far claimed the lives of more than 6,000 people in Germany.
Paris Saint-Germain were declared Ligue 1 champions on Thursday after French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced sport could not resume in France before September.

Meanwhile, English Premier League clubs on Friday reconfirmed their commitment to finish the season subject to coronavirus restrictions being lifted.
There are still 92 games remaining. They will be behind closed doors with neutral venues suggested.
Italy’s 20 Serie A clubs on Friday also reiterated their unanimous desire to complete the season despite sports minister Vincenzo Spadafora this week saying the chances of restarting were “increasingly narrow”.
In Spain, La Liga is planning to start testing players for the coronavirus between Tuesday and Thursday next week, after which they would then be able to resume individual training programmes within 48 hours.
“I hope that we can start playing in June. We have until June 28,” league president Javier Tebas said.

    <h5 class="mb-1">On This Day in 2010: Rory McIlroy wins first PGA Tour title</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy won his first PGA Tour title at the Quail Hollow Championship in Charlotte on May 2, 2010.
Here, the PA news agency looks back at his maiden title in America.
McIlory had only been playing on the PGA tour for six weeks and had started 2010 playing on the European Tour, earning two top-10 finishes, but he could not convert his form in America as he missed the cut at the Houston Open and the Masters. They came ahead of what became the biggest win of his early career as McIlroy, a professional for just three years, proved the doubters wrong.
Despite what was to come, McIlroy was on the verge of missing his third cut in a row on the Friday afternoon. He was two shots over the cut line with three holes to play before an imperious approach from 206 yards allowed him to convert an eagle putt. “Most important shot of the year, to be honest,” McIlroy said at the time. “If I don’t make eagle there, I’m practising at Ponte Vedra this weekend. I said after the 66 yesterday: ‘That could have been the turning point in my season.’ I think today I’ve confirmed that.”
McIlroy’s opening rounds of 72 and 73 had him nine shots behind leader Billy Mayfair after 36 holes before he began to find form. He struck the lowest round on the Saturday, a 66, to set the tone on what would be an exceptional Sunday. “The last two days, it seemed as if everything had just gone right,” he said after winning. “You get yourself into sort of a mindset like that, and you just keep going.”
McIlroy started the final round four behind leader Mayfair and ended the day 10 ahead of the American. He began with three pars before a birdie at the par-four fourth and stormed through the field, racing back to the clubhouse in just 30 – sinking a 43-foot putt on the 18th to seal victory in a course-record 62. The Northern Irishman secured a four-stroke victory over Phil Mickelson as, two weeks before his 21st birthday, he became the youngest winner on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods won in Las Vegas in 1996 aged 20 years and 10 months.
McIlroy has since won the 2011 US Open, the PGA Championship in 2012 and 2014 and the 2014 Open. The Masters has eluded him, with his best finish coming in 2015 when he placed fourth. He has also helped Europe win four Ryder Cups while picking up the FedEx Cup and two Race to Dubai titles and is currently ranked number one in the world.

He has also helped Europe win four Ryder Cups while picking up the FedEx Cup and two Race to Dubai titles and is currently ranked number one in the world.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Time Out: On this day in 2010 Rory McIlroy wins first PGA tour title</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">Rory McIlroy won his first PGA Tour title at the Quail Hollow Championship in Charlotte on May 2, 2010.
Here, we look back at his maiden title in America....
The new boy
McIlory had only been playing on the PGA tour for six weeks and had started 2010 playing on the European Tour, earning two top-10 finishes, but he could not convert his form in America as he missed the cut at the Houston Open and the Masters. They came ahead of what became the biggest win of his early career as McIlroy, a professional for just three years, proved the doubters wrong.
Almost missing the cut
Despite what was to come, McIlroy was on the verge of missing his third cut in a row on the Friday afternoon. He was two shots over the cut line with three holes to play before an imperious approach from 206 yards allowed him to convert an eagle putt. "Most important shot of the year, to be honest," McIlroy said at the time. "If I don't make eagle there, I'm practising at Ponte Vedra this weekend. I said after the 66 yesterday: 'That could have been the turning point in my season.' I think today I've confirmed that."
Making up ground
McIlroy's opening rounds of 72 and 73 had him nine shots behind leader Billy Mayfair after 36 holes before he began to find form. He struck the lowest round on the Saturday, a 66, to set the tone on what would be an exceptional Sunday. "The last two days, it seemed as if everything had just gone right," he said after winning. "You get yourself into sort of a mindset like that, and you just keep going."
The final round
McIlroy started the final round four behind leader Mayfair and ended the day 10 ahead of the American. He began with three pars before a birdie at the par-four fourth and stormed through the field, racing back to the clubhouse in just 30 - sinking a 43-foot putt on the 18th to seal victory in a course-record 62. The Northern Irishman secured a four-stroke victory over Phil Mickelson as, two weeks before his 21st birthday, he became the youngest winner on the PGA Tour since Tiger Woods won in Las Vegas in 1996 aged 20 years and 10 months.
Legacy
McIlroy has since won the 2011 US Open, the PGA Championship in 2012 and 2014 and the 2014 Open. The Masters has eluded him, with his best finish coming in 2015 when he placed fourth. He has also helped Europe win four Ryder Cups while picking up the FedEx Cup and two Race to Dubai titles and is currently ranked number one in the world.

    <h5 class="mb-1">Ten years on - Rory McIlroy remembers his arrival to the big time at Quail Hollow</h5>
    <p class="mb-1 text-truncate-4">It is a decade to the day since Rory McIlroy marked his arrival to the big time with a performance he summed up as "ridiculous".
It was at Quail Hollow GC in the Carolinas that on May 2, 2010, the youngster with the curly hair and pudgy physique picked up his first PGA Tour win.
Ten years on, McIlroy has 18 of them tucked away - as well as two FedEX Cup titles and three Player of the Year awards Stateside - with the promise of many triumphs to come.
Plenty of those victories have been special, but this one was particularly so as he left Phil Mickelson for dust in a magical final round.
It was two days before he turned 21 when McIlroy tamed the course, firing eight birdies and an eagle for a 10-under par 62 to whizz past Mickelson for a prize that propelled him into the world's top 10 for the first time.
He shot a remarkable 16-under total for the weekend having only just made the cut, becoming the first player since Tiger Woods to win a PGA Tour event before his 21st birthday.
“Ridiculous", declared the Holywood prodigy. “I just got in the zone. I saw my shots and just hit them and I saw the line of my putts and they just went in.
“I don’t think I’ve ever played a better round in my life."
The week had started in less than promising fashion as he fought to put a six week period impeded by a back problem behind him.
McIlroy had won twice on the European Tour since turning pro but was looking for some inspiration on the other side of the Atlantic after missing the cut in his previous two PGA tournaments.
He hadn't had a top 10 finish since the WGC Match Play in February and a lack-lustre start at Quail Hollow suggested the lean streak was going to continue.
A double bogey on the par-4 16th blighted his opening round. He carded a 72. On the Friday, five bogeys summed up a ragged performance.
Having started the second round on the 10th tee, he got to the par 5 seventh knowing he was two shots behind the cut mark with three holes left.
Something clicked as he stood over a 206 yard approach to the green. He let rip with his 4-iron to six feet, and made the putt.
Making par on the final two holes, he was in for the weekend by the skin of his teeth.
“The rest is history,” he later reflected.
Returning to an old putter, McIlroy recorded a 66 on Moving Day, his challenge ignited by a run of six birdies in eight holes.
But he was still four shots behind the leader Billy Mayfair going into the final round.
He went on to beat Mayfair by 10 strokes.
“I just got in the zone,” said McIlroy.
Looking for a fast start, he had to wait until the fourth hole for a birdie to drop. But even then the charge didn't come as he could only par the par-5 fifth and parred the sixth, too.
Then runaway train left the station - fuelled by a birdie on another par 5, the seventh. He played the closing 12 holes in nine-under par.
With birdies on eight, nine and 11, McIlroy was in the mix but he achieved total lift-off when the pressure really came on, finishing with a closing run of six threes - with his eagle on 15, set up with a five-iron approach to three feet, getting the crowd to their feet.
“I knew then," said McIlroy afterwards.
"I thought I could just par my way in, which would have been good, and then birdied 16 and 18 as well.”
If that was good, the final stroke of an historic round got a tumultuous response as he sank a 43-foot putt for another birdie. McIlroy's fist pump in victory summed up his feelings.
Jim Nantz called it.
“Welcome to the big time, Rory McIlroy," said the CBS sportscaster.
McIlroy was already the next big thing in golf in the US and his first PGA Tour victory, on May 2, 2010, franked his reputation.
“For him to win here on the PGA Tour before his 21st birthday, I just think sets his career off,” said Mickelson, who had looked on course to follow his Masters triumph with another in North Carolina.
“He’s obviously an impressive player.
"Everybody knows how great he is and sees some of these shots that you just look at in amazement.”
The elated victor added: “I definitely felt like I was playing good golf but just not getting anything out of it," said the elated victor.
"Put my old putter in the bag Friday night and it worked pretty well at the weekend so I think that will be staying in for a little while longer.
“But it’s just incredible. To finish off a golf tournament of this stature like that, on this golf course where so many great players have won before, it’s incredible."
A decade on, McIlroy has €47.35m banked in career earnings alone.
He has held top spot in the world rankings for 100 weeks, has won four major championships, three WGCs and three Race to Dubai and two FedEx Cup titles, 27 victories in total as a professional across the globe and two Ryder Cup triumphs.
“I’ve still got a long way to go," insisted McIlroy back then.
"I just want to concentrate on getting a few more wins and learn as much as I can at the majors.
“I’m looking forward to getting that next win. This has been a great day, and hopefully I’ll look forward to a few more".
